Herbert Hainer 
Chief Executive Officer 
In 2012,  the adidas Group delivered strong financial results despite several external and internal
challenges.  The Group's commitment to innovation and marketing excellence continued to excite
consumers across the globe.  This is clearly mirrored in record sales of € 149 billion.  Further progress
on driving long-term sustainable margin improvements,  together with low levels of operating working
capital as a percentage of sales,  allowed the Group to finish 2012 with a healthy net cash position of
€ 448 million.  As a result of this strong performance,  Management is proposing a dividend to shareholders of € 135,  representing an increase of 35% compared to the prior year. 
Looking out to 2013,  the Group will make further strides towards its Route 2015 strategic goals,  and is
set to deliver another year of double-digit earnings growth. 
In the following interview,  adidas Group CEO Herbert Hainer reflects on the achievements of 2012clarifies the impacts from one-off items and discusses the Group's strategic and financial outlook
for 2013. 

adidas Group   /  2012 Annual Report 
To Our Shareholders
Interview with the CEO

/ 012 
/

What were the key highlights for the Group from
your perspective?
/	
Two of our Group's most important values are passion
and performance.  These really shine through in many of our 2012
achievements.  The obvious highlight has to be the role adidas played
at the year's major sporting events,  which spurred brand sales up
10% currency-neutral.  In particular,  the London 2012 Olympic and
Paralympic Games count amongst the most memorable and inspiring
sporting events of our time.  The Games not only delivered great feats
of athletic performance,  they also united a passionate public,  creating
 spectacular celebration showcasing all that is good about sport.  The
adidas brand as the official sportswear partner of the event and of Team
GB played its role to perfection.  It delivered its most comprehensive
offering of high-performance products ever and contributed significantly
to the emotion of the event with the highly acclaimed 'Take the Stage"
campaign.  In total,  adidas kitted out over 5000 athletes,  11 National
Olympic Committees and 21 national sporting federations,  including
many medal winners wearing adidas,  amongst them gold medallists
David Rudisha,  Jessica Ennis,  Andy Murray and the US women's
gymnastics team,  to name just a few. 
	
Similarly in Poland and Ukraine,  standout performances from
our teams and players at the UEFA EURO 2012 were another catalyst
which truly inspired consumers and fans.  Through their purchases,  they
overwhelmingly reconfirmed adidas as the number one football brandhighlighting that our passion for innovation continues to be the lever
that sets us apart from the competition.  Be it our iconic Predator and
f50 football boots,  the match ball or federation jerseys,  we once again
dominated the world's favourite sport,  achieving new record levels
of sales of well above € 17 billion,  eclipsing even our own very high
expectations.  This passion for innovation leads me to another major
highlight of our year TaylorMade-adidas Golf.  With sales up 48% in just
two years,  our golf business has already rocketed past its initial Route
2015 targets.  Considering that the golf industry is still relatively stagnantthis is a remarkable testament to its relentless focus on helping golfers
perform better. 

Can you outline the reasons for and details related to the
restatement of 2011 and prior year figures?
/	
As we announced last April,  we discovered commercial
irregularities at our Reebok business in India,  bringing to light a high
level of criminal energy and collusion between former employees
and external business partners.  As promised,  we have followed up
vigorously and swiftly on the matter through a thorough internal and
external investigation,  also with police involvement.  Key findings from
our internal investigations include inappropriate recognition of sales,  a
failure to book sales returns and a failure to correctly post credit notes to
accounts receivable.  This resulted in a significant overstatement of net
sales,  accounts receivable as well as materially incorrect accounting for
inventories and provisions.  During the investigation process,  the new
management also discovered four previously undisclosed warehouses
not declared in the official accounting records.  The findings of the
investigations suggest that the practice of inflating sales and profits had
been going on for several years. 
	
As a result of the findings,  we have restated our accounts
in accordance with IAS 8,  which has led to a reduction of net income
attributable to shareholders of € 58 million for 2011,  compared to what
we previously reported.  In addition,  shareholders' equity in the opening
balance sheet for 2011 was negatively impacted by € 153 million
to account for prior year periods.  For further information,  we have
outlined the changes in detail in Note 3 of our 2012 Annual Report.  As
unpleasant as the identified irregularities at Reebok India Company areI am satisfied we have diligently completed our efforts to uncover all the
wrongdoings,  while simultaneously laying the foundation for a healthy
and profitable business for Reebok in India in the future.  In addition,  we
have also taken the opportunity to comprehensively review our internal
control processes and procedures of governance and compliance,  with
the necessary external expertise,  at all of our locations around the world. 
Let me reiterate,  non-compliance with our policies has never been and
will never be tolerated within our organisation. 

adidas Group   /  2012 Annual Report 
35
12

/	
Yes,  absolutely.  2012 has been another successful year for the
adidas Group.  Our products and brands again enjoyed several important
market share wins in key categories and markets.  Sales grew 6%
currency-neutral,  adding € 16 billion in revenues to a new record level
of € 149 billion.  We also made strong bottom-line progress.  The Group's
operating margin excluding goodwill impairment losses improved to
80% and earnings per share excluding goodwill impairment losses
grew 29% to € 378,  also our highest ever.  As a result,  we ended the year
with a net cash position of € 448 million,  a fivefold increase compared to
 year ago.  This significant cash flow generation once again underpins
the trajectory and value we are unlocking with our Route 2015 strategic
business plan. 

	
Finally,  our long-standing and proven ability to tackle internal
and external challenges with speed and determination also warrants
particular mention for 2012.  Be it the full mitigation of the considerable
sourcing cost pressures which cost us 38 percentage points of gross
margin,  the countless hours of vigorous effort to solve the commercial
irregularities at Reebok India Company or the discipline and restraint
in managing our business in a persistently uncertain global economyI am proud of the passion and dedication of our employees to tackle
these challenges.  And more importantly,  all of this was achieved while
continuing to stay diligent and focused on ensuring we remain fully on
course to deliver our ambitious Route 2015 strategic goals. 

20

Herbert,  looking at your 2012 results,  have the financials
lived up to your expectations?

To Our Shareholders
Interview with the CEO

/ 012 
/

You also had goodwill impairment losses in 2012.  Could you
please elaborate on what the reasons for this were? Does this
have any impact on your future outlook?

20

12

36

/	
First of all,  let me point out that impairment losses are non-cash
in nature and do not affect the adidas Group's financial situation,  nor
our future outlook.  Taking into account our updated targets for Route
2015,  outlined in September,  and following our review of medium-term
growth prospects for specific markets and segments,  as part of the
annual impairment test,  we came to the conclusion that a few of our
cash-generating units need to be impaired.  The resulting impairment
of € 265 million means we have reduced goodwill on our balance sheet
by 17% to € 13 billion.  In the overall scheme of things,  from a balance
sheet perspective,  the negative impact on total assets is minor,  at
only 2%.  Looking at the specifics,  within wholesale cash-generating
units,  goodwill impairment losses amounted to € 106 million in North
America,  € 41 million in Latin America,  € 15 million in Brazil and
€ 11 million in Iberia.  The impairment losses were mainly caused by
adjusted growth assumptions for the Reebok brand,  especially in North
America,  Latin America and Brazil,  and an increase in the countryspecific discount rates as a result of the euro crisis.  In addition,  goodwill
of € 68 million allocated to Reebok-CCM Hockey and € 24 million
allocated to Rockport was impaired.  These impairment losses are the
result of the re-evaluation of future growth prospects and,  with regard
to Rockport,  also due to an increase in the discount rate.  Again,  we have
provided full transparency and clarity on this topic in Note 2 of our 2012
Annual Report. 

2012 was another year of significant cash generation.  What are
your plans in terms of capital deployment?
/	
Through our continuous focus on cash flow generation,  we have
increased our net cash to € 448 million.  Our cash flow from operating
activities was up 17%.  This once again demonstrates the strength of our
business model and puts us in a superb position to support and invest
in the opportunities and growth initiatives of our Route 2015 strategic
business plan.  Executing on this will ultimately yield superior returns
to our shareholders.  Therefore,  I do not see any reason to change
our approach right now.  We will continue to pay down our maturing
gross borrowings,  which will amount to € 280 million in 2013.  And
we will increase our capital expenditure to between € 500 million and
€ 550 million to further support Group-wide initiatives in areas such as
own retail,  infrastructure and IT.  However,  at the same time,  we will also
continue to advance direct shareholder returns,  and the annual dividend
is currently our focus tool for this.  For 2012,  we intend to pay a dividend
per share of € 135,  which is 35% more than in 2011.  This represents a
payout ratio excluding goodwill impairment losses of 357%,  compared
to 341% last year. 

Although the fourth quarter is a small contributor to your
annual results,  is there anything we should be concerned
about with weaker trends in the period?
/	
No,  definitely not.  I highlighted in November that there would
be a few negative factors to consider in the fourth quarter.  Firstly,  our
European business faced the anniversary of the sell-in of high-margin
event-related products for the Olympic and Paralympic Games as
well as the UEFA EURO 2012.  Secondly,  we continued to see negative
impacts on Reebok from the NFL licence termination as well as the
finalisation of our clean-up efforts at Reebok India Company.  And
thirdly,  the NHL lockout,  which unfortunately extended into January
2013,  negatively impacted our results. 
	
However,  I also see a lot of positives in the quarter.  We achieved
our key goal to keep our markets and channels clean and healthy. 
Throughout the year,  we have shown the utmost discipline in managing
our inventories and working capital requirements tightly.  So much
so,  we finished the year with average operating working capital as
a percentage of sales of 200%,  well below the prior year level.  This also
helped to ensure that our gross margin improved,  as lower clearance
sales provided a two percentage point increase for the quarter.  We also
continued to show excellent growth in key markets such as Greater
China and European Emerging Markets,  where currency-neutral sales
increased 12% and 9%,  respectively.  In fact,  taking all these factors
together,  our profitability actually turned out a little better than we had
anticipated for the full year.

innovative global brands with functional,  stylish and fashionable products
which they can identify with.  adidas fits perfectly to this consumer andon top of our global appeal,  we also infuse our brand messages and
products with local flair and understanding to ensure we are always top
of mind.  This approach spans the entire offering,  and this strength is
underpinned through the fact that we saw double-digit growth in adidas
Sport Performance,  adidas Originals and the adidas NEO label in 2012. 

Taking all the negative impacts for Reebok into account,  what
was the underlying business trend,  and what do you expect for
the brand in 2013?
/	
Reebok sales declined 18% currency-neutral in 2012.  Excluding
the impacts from the discontinuation of the NFL business and the
transfer of NHL-related sales to Reebok-CCM Hockey,  sales declined
8%.  The brand's gross margin was essentially flat at 359%,  which is
not a bad performance,  given we had quite some promotional activity
to move old toning products during the year.  While we are obviously
disappointed with the result,  we have seen the underlying business
further stabilise.  In the fourth quarter,  Reebok sales excluding licence
revenues were up 3% currency-neutral.  To ensure this now continueswe will commence a major brand and category offensive in fitness in
2013.  Our new category approach,  which we call 'The House of Fitness"allows Reebok to engage with consumers,  regardless of how they
choose to stay fit.  It focuses on five key areas: Fitness Training,  Fitness
Running,  Studio categories including Yoga,  Dance and Aerobics,  Walking
as well as Classics.  Several new footwear and apparel collections will
be launched throughout the year to create a broad-based foundation
for long-term,  sustainable success.  For example,  in Fitness TrainingReebok will introduce the Reebok Delta collection,  which takes design
inspiration from the CrossFit community.  This collection is redefining
the fitness apparel aesthetic,  with every piece designed and developed
for the freedom of movement for any fitness activity.  In addition to new
products,  we will activate new exciting partnerships to authenticate and
give credibility to Reebok in each category.  Renowned yoga instructor
Tara Stiles,  the Spartan Race series of obstacle races and the Red Bull
X-Alps adventure race are just a taste of what's to come over the next
couple of years.  Bringing it all together,  in 2013,  the Reebok brand will
speak to the consumer with one voice by launching a global campaign. 
The campaign,  which is called 'Live with Fire",  will be the brand's first
concerted effort to inspire the fitness consumer to live a life of passionintent and purpose.  Everything I see so far confirms we are gaining
traction again with retailers and consumers,  and I fully expect a return
to growth for Reebok once we anniversary the last of the NFL-related
comparisons in the first quarter.

For many players in our industry,  China was indeed a challenge
in 2012.  However,  this was mainly the result of certain specific
competitor issues and not due to any lack of interest in sporting goods
on the part of the consumer.  In fact,  Chinese consumers have seen their
real income continue to grow strongly,  and this is supporting spending
power and consumption for our industry.  What is our recipe for success?
Well,  it comes back to one of the guiding principles of our Route 2015
strategic plan focus on the consumer.  As part of a rising middle
class,  our consumer target group in China is maturing at a rapid pacebecoming increasingly discerning and sophisticated.  They are looking for 
Additionally,  we have deepened our already very close relationship with
our retail partners,  who now operate more than 7500 points of sale
across Greater China.  By ensuring that our business remains constantly
in tune with theirs,  in particular through our industry leadership in
terms of keeping our inventories under control,  we have been able to
keep our product offerings fresh and new at the point of sale.  This is a
clear edge we are enjoying and will continue to enjoy.  Looking forwardfrom our market research,  we can see that adidas' brand appeal has the
most momentum in the Chinese market right now.  I fully expect this to
continue in 2013,  and I am confident we will take more market share and
grow faster than our major competitors in this critical market.

Speaking of China,  many sporting goods companies had a
difficult 2012,  whereas the adidas Group grew by 15%.  What is
the reason behind this and what can we expect in 2013?

To Our Shareholders
Interview with the CEO

/ 012 
/

Given that there have been some challenging recent trends in
North America,  what is your view on the Group's prospects in
this key market?
/	
 am very bullish on our prospects in North America.  While 2012
was not a good year for Reebok in the region,  adidas and TaylorMadeadidas Golf had very strong results.  TaylorMade-adidas Golf enjoyed the
fastest growth,  with sales increasing 25% in the period.  adidas brand
sales are up 9% currency-neutral,  and have increased one third since we
began Route 2015,  which is well ahead of market growth.  In fact,  when
we dig deeper into the adidas numbers,  our business with our key high
school kid relevant retail partners was up over 20% in 2012.  As already
outlined,  for Route 2015,  we are focused on quality growth,  which is
crucial to securing long-term,  sustainable success for the adidas brand
in this market.  Through Originals and basketball,  we have created a
great base to build on and,  quite frankly,  when I look at our plans for
running,  we are only at just the beginning to exploit the tremendous
opportunities this market has to offer our Group.  This year,  we intend
to push very aggressively into the back-to-school period with adidas and
Reebok.  And bearing in mind another comprehensive year of product
launches for TaylorMade-adidas Golf,  I am confident all of our brands
will grow in 2013 in North America.

Controlled space initiatives remain one of the cornerstones to
your Route 2015 strategy.  Can you tell us what progress you
are making in these areas?
/	
Looking across the Group,  there are some very notable
highlights in relation to controlled space,  and the biggest of these is
that we have already hit our initial Route 2015 ambition to achieve 45%
of sales from these activities.  All of our channels have been very active
pursuing this strategy,  whether through shop-in-shops and franchise
stores with our wholesale partners,  or through our own consumerdirect initiatives.  With Retail,  in particular,  we are making significant
strides.  In 2012,  we saw strong comparable store sales growth of 7%as important retail store KPIs such as traffic,  average ticket value and
full price sell-through continued to improve.  In addition,  we also saw
higher levels of store operational efficiency and productivity,  which was
 major driver in leveraging our Retail segment operating expenses as
a percentage of sales by 19 percentage points.  I am also happy that the
structural improvements we have been implementing in our eCommerce
operations are now beginning to take meaningful commercial shape. 
Key to our efforts in 2012 was the launch of our fully integrated brand
and store site,  providing a single destination for each of our brand's
consumers.  While we have been among the industry leaders in digital
brand activation,  particularly in leveraging our iconic assets,  such
as the world's greatest footballer Lionel Messi,  basketball superstar
Derrick Rose or teen idol Selena Gomez,  we are now starting to make
rapid progress in converting this online buzz and activity into traffic to
our e-shops.  This is clearly evident in the 68% currency-neutral sales
growth we generated last year through our own e-commerce sites,  with
sales from the channel now up to € 158 million.  This means we are well
on the way to our target of € 500 million net sales from this channel
by 2015. 

2013 is a so-called in-between year.  How confident are you
that you can grow globally despite the non-recurrence of
major sporting events?
/	
 am very confident.  Even though there will be some phasing and
timing impacts from the prior year event-related sales,  and bearing in
mind the consumer and retail environment are,  on balance,  no better
in 2013,  our product pipeline and marketing plans are packed with
game-changing innovations,  be it in running,  basketball,  footballlifestyle,  fitness or golf.  In fact,  I believe when we look back in hindsight
at the end of Route 2015,  2013 will be judged as the year we changed the
course of innovation in our industry.  Let me give you a few examples why. 
At adidas,  in the running category,  where all great footwear innovation
starts,  we will introduce two breakthrough innovations,  Energy Boost
and SpringBlade.  I am certain they will be the catalyst for multi-year
growth and market share gains globally.  Boost has,  already in only a few
short weeks,  seen higher levels of engagement and enthusiasm from
the most experienced industry experts than any running product we
have ever brought to market before.  Together with our partner BASFthe world's leading chemical company,  we created a completely new
foam cushioning material.  With its distinctive and unique midsole cell
structure,  it provides more energy return than any other foam cushioning
material in the running industry,  combining soft comfort with responsive
energy for the ultimate running experience.  In the heat,  in the cold and
after countless kilometres,  it performs more consistently and doesn't
lose its cushioning properties like standard EVA foam. 
	
Beyond products,  we will also raise the game in icon building
and brand activation.  This year,  we will build core signature collections
around several of our superstars,  including Derrick Rose and Lionel
Messi.  We have also major campaigns planned for the brand to support
our product launches and to ensure a deeper consumer connectionsuch as a new impactful women's campaign,  myGirls,  and a global
Originals campaign,  Unite all Originals. 
	
And it will be the same at our other brands.  Reebok we spoke
about before.  At TaylorMade-adidas Golf,  our fast pace of new launches
will also continue.  The new RocketBladez irons have already sent our
market share skywards to over 30% since launch.  With new,  longer
metalwoods such as the R1 and RocketBallz Stage 2,  a major offensive
in golf footwear with the adizero range,  and the first full year of Adams
Golf,  I fully expect our golf business to further stretch the distance
between ourselves and our nearest rivals. 
	
We are therefore very well positioned to again achieve record
sales in 2013.  For the full year,  we expect currency-neutral sales to
increase at a mid-single-digit rate,  with growth across all brandsregions and channels.  In terms of phasing,  sales growth is expected to
be weighted towards the second half of the year,  mainly mirroring our
product launch schedule as well as the build-up to the FIFA World Cup
in 2014.

To Our Shareholders

/ 012 
/

What other progress can we anticipate in 2013 in terms
of your financials?
/	
2013 will also see a step change in the pace of gross margin
and operating margin expansion.  The adidas Group gross margin
is forecasted to increase to a level between 480% and 485%. 
Over-proportionate growth in high-margin emerging markets and
Retail will positively impact this development.  Our operating margin will
improve considerably in line with our previously announced guidance
of approaching 90%.  This,  in turn,  will lead to another year of doubledigit earnings growth,  with earnings per share excluding goodwill
impairment losses increasing at a rate of 12% to 16% to a level between
€ 425 and € 440. 

Finally,  Herbert,  why have you chosen the title
'Pushing Boundaries" for the 2012 Annual Report?
/	
It is certainly not by chance that we created this motto for our
2012 Annual Report.  Alone from our extraordinary product innovationsgreat designs and cutting-edge construction methods,  our ability to
push boundaries has helped athletes to go faster,  hit further and achieve
their impossible at the pinnacle of sport for decades.  However,  pushing
boundaries at our Group definitely goes far beyond this definition.  It
lives in every aspect of our business.  Every day,  we collectively strive to
bring a culture of pushing boundaries to life constantly motivating and
challenging each other to improve.  The founder of adidas Adi Dassler –
is often quoted as saying 'strive for perfection; there's always something
you can improve".  This is exactly the spirit I am referring to: creating
the unexpected,  open and committed to doing things better.  'Pushing
Boundaries" is,  has been,  and always will be at the very heart of
everything we do across our Group.  This is the edge that will ensure our
Group's success along Route 2015,  and well into the future.

Dear Shareholders20

We look back on 2012 as an extremely successful year.  Thanks to strong brands as well as innovative products and marketing
campaigns,  the adidas Group was able to grow in all markets,  achieving record sales as well as record operating cash flow.  The
visibility of the adidas brand at the year's major sports events and the market share gains of TaylorMade-adidas Golf were key
highlights.  The Group was,  however,  not without challenges in 2012,  with the continuation of the sovereign debt crisis in Europe and
the discovery of commercial irregularities at Reebok India Company being particular headwinds.  Nevertheless,  these issues have
been proactively and resolutely managed.  With a strong balance sheet,  the Group is well positioned to enjoy another year of progress
in 2013. 

Supervision and advice in dialogue with the Executive Board
In the past year,  we again regularly advised the Executive Board on the management of the company and carefully and continuously
supervised its management activities,  assuring ourselves of the legality,  expediency and regularity thereof. 
We were directly involved in all of the Group's fundamental decisions.  After in-depth consultation and examination of the detailed
information submitted to us by the Executive Board,  we approved individual transactions where required by law. 
The Executive Board informed us extensively and in a timely manner through written and oral reports at our Supervisory Board
meetings.  This information covered all relevant aspects of the Group's business strategy and business planning,  including financeinvestment and personnel planning,  the course of business and the Group's financial position and profitability.  We were also kept
up to date on matters relating to the risk situation,  risk management and compliance as well as all major decisions and business
transactions. 
The Executive Board regularly provided us with detailed reports for the preparation of our meetings.  We thus always had the
opportunity to critically analyse the reports and resolution proposals within the committees and within the Supervisory Board as a
whole and,  after in-depth examination and consultation,  to put forward any suggestions we might have before resolving upon the
Executive Board's resolution proposals.  In the periods between our meetings,  the Executive Board kept us continuously informed
about the current business situation by means of monthly reports. 
We held five Supervisory Board meetings in 2012.  In addition,  we held a meeting in February 2013,  at which we discussed matters
relating to the 2012 financial year.  Apart from one meeting,  which two members were not able to attend due to urgent business
appointments that could not be postponed,  all Supervisory Board members attended all meetings in the year under review.  The
average attendance rate at Supervisory Board meetings was just under 97%.  All the committee meetings were fully attended.  The
external auditor,  KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft (KPMG),  attended all meetings of the Supervisory Board,  inasfar as 
adidas Group   /  2012 Annual Report 
To Our Shareholders
Supervisory Board Report 
/ 015 
/

they did not deal with Executive Board matters.  KPMG attended all meetings of the Audit Committee.  The employee representatives
held separate meetings to prepare agenda items for the meetings of the entire Supervisory Board. 
In the periods between meetings,  the Supervisory Board Chairman and the Audit Committee Chairman maintained regular contact
with the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer with respect to matters such as corporate strategy,  business
development and planning,  the risk situation and risk management as well as compliance and major business transactions. 
The consultations and examinations of the entire Supervisory Board focused on the following topics:

Business development
The development of sales and earnings,  the employment situation as well as the financial position of the Group and the
business development of individual markets were presented to us in detail by the Executive Board at every Supervisory Board
meeting following the close of the respective quarter and were subsequently discussed together.  At each meeting,  we placed
considerable focus on the possible impact of global economic developments and the development of individual brands.  We dealt
intensively with the business development of the Reebok brand and its future strategic orientation.  The Executive Board informed
us that Reebok's sales were forecasted to be below original expectations and explained the main reasons for the decline,  pointing
out that this was expected to be offset by the very positive sales development of the other brands.  At our meeting in Novemberwe discussed the future strategic positioning of one of the smaller business segments,  for which we established the ad hoc
committee 'Project 99". 
The KPMG-certified 2011 annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements,  including the combined management
report for adidas AG and the Group,  as well as the Executive Board's proposal regarding the appropriation of retained earnings,  were
discussed and examined in the presence of the Executive Board and the auditor on March 6,  2012. 

Transactions requiring Supervisory Board approval
In accordance with statutory regulations and the Rules of Procedure of the Supervisory Board,  certain transactions and measures
require a formal resolution or the prior approval of the Supervisory Board. 
At our meeting on March 6,  2012,  we discussed and resolved upon the resolutions to be proposed to the 2012 Annual General
Meeting,  including the proposal regarding the appropriation of retained earnings for the 2011 financial year.  At this meetingfollowing in-depth discussion,  we also approved the sale of land belonging to GEV Grundstücksgesellschaft Herzogenaurach mbH
& Co.  KG ('GEV KG") to the town of Herzogenaurach ('the Town") and the purchase of the remaining share in GEV KG held by
the Town.  At the same meeting,  we dealt intensively with the possible issuance of a convertible bond by adidas AG in an amount
of up to € 500 million.  We delegated granting approval of the issuance of the convertible bond and determination of the terms
and conditions,  within the framework approved by the Supervisory Board,  to the ad hoc committee 'Convertible Bond/Bond with
Warrants",  which was established at this meeting.  Furthermore,  following a detailed presentation by the Executive Board relating
to the planned expansion of the Group's golf segment,  we discussed the possibility of acquiring Adams Golf,  Inc.,  the market leader
in the hybrid sector.  In order to pursue this project efficiently,  we formed the 'Apple" committee,  which was responsible for final
approval of the acquisition that was subsequently completed in June 2012. 
At our meetings in August and November,  respectively,  we also discussed in detail and approved a capital injection for Reebok
India Company in an amount of up to € 300 million and for adidas Canada Limited in an amount of CAD 50 million (approximately
€ 39 million). 

Matters relating to the Executive Board
 key topic of our meeting on February 8,  2012,  was the variable compensation components payable to the Executive Board. 
Following in-depth discussion,  we resolved upon the General Committee's proposals for the amount of the 2011 Performance
Bonus to be granted to each member of the Executive Board and the LTIP Bonus 2009/2011 to be granted for the three-year period
from 2009 to 2011.  Furthermore,  following in-depth consultation,  we resolved upon the key performance criteria for granting
the 2012 Performance Bonus,  together with the individual short-term targets,  as well as the Performance Bonus target amount
relevant for each Executive Board member,  as proposed by the General Committee.  As the LTIP 2009/2011 had expired at the end of

At our meeting in August,  the Executive Board provided us with detailed information on the compliance case that had arisen in
connection with Reebok India Company.  We discussed this matter in detail under the aspects of compliance,  risk management and
the potential impact on the previous year's consolidated financial statements as well as on the business development for the year
under review. 

To Our Shareholders
Supervisory Board Report

the 2011 financial year,  we also discussed and approved the General Committee's proposal to set up a new compensation plan with
long-term incentive effect covering the three-year period from 2012 to 2014 ('LTIP 2012/2014").  When determining the two variable
compensation components,  we took into account that the compensation incentive of the 2012 Performance Bonus Plan shall not exceed
the compensation incentive resulting from the sustainability-oriented variable compensation component,  the LTIP 2012/2014.  The
Annual General Meeting approved the changed compensation system on May 10,  2012. 
At our meeting on November 7,  2012,  following detailed discussion of the proposal submitted by the General Committee,  we resolved
upon an appropriate increase in the Chief Executive Officer's fixed annual salary,  which had remained unchanged for the past three
years,  to become effective from spring 2013.  We took this decision in particular in light of his outstanding personal performance and
the excellent position of the Group. 
Key topics at our meeting in February 2013 as well as of our circular resolution were the Performance Bonuses for the 2012
financial year and for the previous years.  We dealt with the impact on the degree of target achievement for the Performance
Bonuses as determined in the previous years,  resulting from adjustments made to the 2011 consolidated financial statements in
the context of the 2012 consolidated financial statements  /   NOTE 03,  P.  203.  We discussed in-depth the proposal prepared by the
SEE
General Committee,  based on the adjusted figures,  and subsequently resolved upon a redetermination of the Performance Bonuses
for the 2011 financial year and the previous years,  including a corresponding obligation for repayment by the Executive Board,  while
upholding the LTIP Bonus 2009/2011,  the latter requiring no redetermination.  The Executive Board members and the Chairman of
the General Committee were already in agreement prior to the meeting that the Performance Bonuses should be partially repaid. 
We further resolved upon the proposal submitted by the General Committee with regard to the 2012 Performance Bonus.

Corporate governance
The Supervisory Board regularly monitors the application and further development of the corporate governance regulations within
the company,  in particular the implementation of the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code (the 'Code").  In
addition to our February meetings,  at which corporate governance is usually the focal point,  at our August meeting,  we dealt with
the implementation of the efficiency examinations scheduled for the year under review and resolved to conduct these examinations
by means of a questionnaire and the involvement of an external consultant.  Another topic of this meeting was the amendments to
the Code which were adopted by the Government Commission on the German Corporate Governance Code on May 15,  2012.  The
Code now recommends,  inter alia,  that in the objectives the Supervisory Board resolves upon with regard to its composition,  it shall
specify the number of independent Supervisory Board members it considers adequate.  At our meeting on February 12,  2013,  we
reviewed the objective we had resolved upon in February 2011,  which also covers this topic,  with the result that,  taking into account
the employment contracts of the employee representatives,  we continue to uphold our objective that all Supervisory Board members
shall be independent as defined by the Code.  Our other key objectives relating to the composition of the Supervisory Board also
continue to apply.  At this meeting,  following in-depth consultation and the recommendation of the Audit Committee,  which is also
responsible for corporate governance topics,  we then resolved upon the 2013 Declaration of Compliance.  The deviation from the
Code contained in the 2012 Declaration of Compliance Supervisory Board compensation does not have any performance-related
component which we had resolved upon at our meeting on February 8,  2012,  is no longer included in the 2013 Declaration of
Compliance as the new version of the Code no longer contains the recommendation to include a performance-related component
for Supervisory Board members.  The Declarations of Compliance were made permanently available to shareholders on the
corporate website at  : //  
wWW. ADIDAS-GROUP. COM/CORPORATEGOVERNANCE. 
There was no indication of any conflicts of interest on the part of the members of the Executive and Supervisory Boards which would

we have delegated the Supervisory Board's authority to pass resolutions to individual committees.  With the exception of the
Audit Committee,  the Supervisory Board Chairman also chairs all the standing committees.  The respective chairman always
informed the Supervisory Board about the content and results of the committee meetings at the subsequent meeting of the entire
Supervisory Board. 
The committees' work in the year under review is summarised as follows:

/ The Steering Committee,  which is authorised to pass resolutions on behalf of the entire Supervisory Board in particularly urgent
cases,  did not meet in the year under review. 

/ The Audit Committee held five meetings in 2012,  and also one meeting in March 2013,  dealing with topics of the year
under review.  The Chief Financial Officer and the auditor were present at all meetings and reported to the committee members
in detail. 
The committee members examined the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements for 2011including the combined management report for adidas AG and the Group,  as well as the Executive Board's proposal regarding
the appropriation of retained earnings and,  following an in-depth review of the audit reports with the auditor,  recommended that
the Supervisory Board approve the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements.  After obtaining the
auditor's declaration of independence,  the Audit Committee submitted a recommendation to the Supervisory Board with respect
to its proposal to the Annual General Meeting concerning the selection of the auditor of the annual financial statements and the
consolidated financial statements.  Following the selection of the auditor at the Annual General Meeting in May 2012,  the Audit
Committee duly commissioned the auditor to carry out the audit on the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial
statements for 2012.  Together with the auditor,  the Audit Committee established the priority topics for the audit and dealt with
the audit fees.  In the course of its examination of the auditor's independence,  the Audit Committee obtained information on the
measures taken by the auditor to guarantee independence and assured itself that the auditor does not face any conflicts of interest. 
The members of the Audit Committee also focused on the detailed examination of the quarterly financial reports and the first half
year report,  together with the Chief Financial Officer and the auditor,  prior to their publication. 
At one Audit Committee meeting,  the committee members focused solely on the topic of risk management and the internal control
system as well as the compliance system.  In this context,  the committee members dealt in particular with the main risk factors for
the Group and the related control measures as well as the expansion of the compliance organisation and compliance management. 
The committee members critically analysed the audit results of the Internal Audit function and approved the audit plan for 2012/2013. 
As part of their examination of the effectiveness of the internal control system and the internal audit system,  the committee members
reviewed in depth the applied methods and systems and the effectiveness thereof with the aid of written and oral reports.  In the
course of the following detailed discussions,  inter alia with the auditor,  they assured themselves of the effectiveness of the systems.

/ The General Committee,  which prepares the resolutions of the Supervisory Board on Executive Board related matters,  held three
meetings in 2012,  two of them by way of a conference call.  An additional meeting dealing with the determination of the Executive
Board members' variable compensation for 2012 as well as with possible changes to the previous years' variable compensation
took place in February 2013.  At its meeting on February 8,  2012,  the committee discussed the amount of the Performance Bonus
to be granted to each Executive Board member for the 2011 financial year,  based on the key financial figures available at the time. 
Furthermore,  the General Committee focused on the Executive Board's achievement of the targets of the LTIP Bonus 2009/2011 and
developed detailed resolution proposals to be presented to the Supervisory Board concerning the amount of the 2011 Performance
Bonus and the LTIP Bonus 2009/2011.  Another topic of this meeting was the discussion on the 2012 Performance Bonus Plan and
the LTIP 2012/2014.  At its meeting on February 29,  2012,  the General Committee prepared the corresponding resolution proposals
to be submitted to the Supervisory Board.  At its meeting on October 29,  2012,  the General Committee discussed an appropriate
increase in the Chief Executive Officer's annual fixed salary,  which had remained unchanged for three years,  and prepared a
corresponding resolution proposal for the Supervisory Board.  At its meeting in February 2013,  the committee members thoroughly
discussed reassessing the Performance Bonuses for the 2011 financial year and the prior years based on the financial figures relevant
for the amount of the Performance Bonuses,  given that certain relevant figures had been adjusted in the context of restating the 2011
consolidated financial statements.  The restated prior year figures did not necessitate an adjustment of the LTIP Bonus 2009/2011.  In
its resolution proposal to the Supervisory Board,  the committee recommended a redetermination of the Performance Bonuses as well
as determining the amounts to be repaid by the Executive Board members.  After consulting accordingly,  the General Committee also
resolved upon the resolution proposal to be submitted to the Supervisory Board with respect to the Performance Bonus to be paid to
each Executive Board member for the 2012 financial year based on the determined degree of individual target achievement.

The 'Convertible Bond/Bond with Warrants" committee held two meetings by way of a conference call,  during which it dealt
intensively with the decision whether to issue a convertible bond in an amount of up to € 500 million,  excluding shareholders'
subscription rights,  and also with the terms and conditions of the convertible bond.  After an in-depth review of the comprehensive
information provided by the Executive Board,  the committee approved the issuance of the convertible bond with the terms and
conditions proposed by the Executive Board. 
The chairmen of the committees reported to the Supervisory Board on the results of the meetings in detail and in a timely manner,  in
oral and sometimes written form. 

Examination of the adidas AG 2012 annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements

KPMG audited the 2012 consolidated financial statements prepared by the Executive Board in accordance with § 315a German Commercial
Code (Handelsgesetzbuch HGB) in compliance with IFRS and issued an unqualified opinion thereon.  The auditor also approved without
qualification the 2012 annual financial statements of adidas AG,  prepared in accordance with HGB requirements,  as well as the combined
management report for adidas AG and the Group.  The financial statements,  the proposal put forward by the Executive Board regarding the
appropriation of retained earnings and the auditor's reports were distributed by the Executive Board to all Supervisory Board members
in a timely manner.  We examined the documents in depth,  with a particular focus on legality and regularity,  in the presence of the auditor
at the Audit Committee meeting held on March 1,  2013 and at the Supervisory Board's March 6,  2013 financial statements meetingduring which the Executive Board explained the financial statements in detail.  We were informed in detail regarding the corrections made
to the 2011 consolidated financial statements,  which the Audit Committee had already dealt with in depth at its meeting.  Key to these
meetings were also the Executive Board's commentaries and the subsequent discussions concerning the goodwill impairment necessary
for the 2012 financial year.  At both meetings,  the auditor reported the material results of the audit with a focus on the priority topics of
the year under review as agreed with the Audit Committee and was available for questions and the provision of additional information. 
The auditor did not report any significant weaknesses with respect to the internal control and risk management system relating to the
accounting process.  We also discussed in depth with the Executive Board the proposal concerning the appropriation of retained earningswhich provides for a dividend of € 135 per dividend-entitled share and adopted it in light of the Group's good financial situation and future
prospects as well as the expectations of our shareholders.  Based on our own examinations of the annual and consolidated financial
statements as well as of the corrections to the 2011 consolidated financial statements,  we are convinced that there are no objections to
be raised.  Following the recommendation of the Audit Committee,  at our financial statements meeting,  we therefore approved the audit
results,  including the audit of the corrections made to the 2011 consolidated financial statements,  and the financial statements prepared
by the Executive Board.  The annual financial statements of adidas AG were thus approved. 

Expression of thanks
The Supervisory Board wishes to thank the Executive Board and all adidas Group employees around the world for their tremendous
personal dedication,  their performance and their ongoing commitment,  and we also thank the employee representatives for their good
collaboration.

Corporate Governance Report including
the Declaration on Corporate Governance 1)
Corporate Governance stands for responsible and transparent management and corporate control
oriented towards a sustainable increase in value.  These principles apply to all corporate functions
and are an essential foundation for sustainable corporate success.  We are convinced that good
corporate governance enhances the confidence placed in our Group by our shareholders,  business
partners,  employees and the financial markets. 

As a globally operating public listed company with its registered seat
in Herzogenaurach,  Germany,  adidas AG is,  inter alia,  subject to the
provisions of German stock corporation law.  A dual board system,  which
assigns the management of the company to the Executive Board and
advice and supervision of the Executive Board to the Supervisory Boardis one of the fundamental principles of German stock corporation law. 
These two boards are strictly separated in terms of membership and
duties and responsibilities.  In the interest of the company,  however,  both
Boards cooperate closely. 

Composition and working methods of the Executive Board
Our Executive Board consists of four members /   EE EXECUTIVE BOARDS
There are no Executive Board committees.  The Executive Board is
responsible for independently managing the company,  determining the
Group's strategic orientation,  agreeing this with the Supervisory Board
and ensuring its implementation.  Further,  it defines business targetscorporate policy and the organisation of the Group.  Additionally,  the
Executive Board ensures appropriate risk management and risk control as
well as compliance with statutory regulations and internal guidelines.  It is
bound to the company's interests and obligated to strive for a sustainable
increase in company value.  When filling management positions in the
company,  the Executive Board takes diversity into consideration.  It
especially aims for an appropriate consideration of women.  We plan to
increase the number of women in management positions from currently
28% to between 32% and 35% worldwide by 2015  /   EE EMPLOYEES,  p.  111. 


P.  40. 

Irrespective of the Executive Board's overall responsibility,  its members
are individually responsible for managing their respective business areas
in accordance with the Executive Board's Business Allocation Plan.  The
CEO is responsible in particular for leading the entire Executive Board as
well as for management of the Group's business policy.  The members of
the Executive Board keep each other informed on all significant events in
their business areas and align on all cross-functional measures.  Further
details on collaboration within the Executive Board are governed by the
Rules of Procedure of the Executive Board and the Business Allocation
Plan.  These documents specifically stipulate requirements for meetings
and resolutions as well as for cooperation with the Supervisory Board.

Our Supervisory Board consists of six shareholder representatives
and six employee representatives in accordance with the German
Co-Determination Act (Mitbestimmungsgesetz MitbestG)  /   SUPERSEE
VISORY BOARD,  P.  44.  The Supervisory Board currently has two female
members.  Five members of the Supervisory Board have many years
of international experience.  The composition of the Supervisory
Board is characterised by a high degree of diversity resulting from the
different professional backgrounds of the members and comprehensive
knowledge of various industries.  The members of our Supervisory Board
do not exercise directorship or similar positions or advisory tasks for
key competitors of the company.  Further,  they do not have business
or personal relations with adidas AG or its Executive Board which may
cause a substantial and not merely temporary conflict of interest  /

SUPERVISORY BOARD REPORT,  P.  46. 
At its meeting held on February 9,  2011,  and in accordance with the
recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code ('the

its composition:

/ 
Maintain two female members on the Supervisory Board until the
next election of the Supervisory Board in 2014. 
/ 
Increase the degree of female representation on the Supervisory
Board as of the next election of shareholder representatives and
employee representatives in 2014; the Supervisory Board strives for
at least three female members on the Supervisory Board,  at least one
of them on the side of the shareholder representatives. 
/ 
Maintain the independence of all Supervisory Board members while
considering the work relationships of the employee representatives
vis-à-vis the company. 
/ 
Consider the age limit of,  in general,  72 at the time of the election. 
In view of the amendments to the Code resolved upon in May 2012,  at its
meeting in February 2013,  the Supervisory Board reviewed the objectives
for its future composition,  especially the independence criteriadetermined already in February 2011.  Following prior consultationthe Supervisory Board,  in principle,  reconfirmed the objectives for
its composition determined in 2011.  With regard to independence,  it
considers that the employment contracts of the employee representatives
alone do not give any grounds to doubt their independence as defined by
the Code.  The independence of all Supervisory Board members remains
one of its objectives.

In order to increase the efficiency of its work,  the Supervisory Board has
formed five permanent expert committees from within its memberswhich,  inter alia,  prepare its resolutions and,  in certain cases,  pass
resolutions on its behalf.  These committees are the Steering Committeethe General Committee,  the Audit Committee,  the Mediation Committee
in accordance with § 27 section 3 MitbestG and the Nomination
Committee.  In addition,  the Supervisory Board has four project-related
ad hoc committees,  which were established in 2009 and 2012.  The
chairmen of the committees report to the entire Supervisory Board on
the results of the committee work on a regular basis.  The composition of
the committees and their respective tasks can be found on our website. 
Apart from the tasks and responsibilities,  the Rules of Procedure of the
Supervisory Board and of the Audit Committee also set out the individual
requirements expected of the members and the procedure for meetings
and passing resolutions.  These Rules of Procedure are available on our
website.  The activities of the Supervisory Board and its committees in
the financial year are outlined in the Supervisory Board Report  /  
see
Supervisory Board Report,  p.  46. 

The present composition of the Supervisory Board is in compliance with
the aforementioned objectives.  An increase in the percentage of female
members is to be endeavoured at the next regular Supervisory Board
elections,  to be held at the Annual General Meeting in 2014.  In selecting
nominees,  in the interest of mutually complementing cooperation
within the Supervisory Board,  sufficient diversity in terms of different
professional backgrounds,  expert and industry knowledge as well as
experience in,  inter alia,  applying accounting principles and internal
control systems are furthermore to be taken into account. 
Irrespective of the consideration of these objectives and criteria,  the
best interests of the company will continue to play a decisive role for
the Supervisory Board when nominating candidates for election. 
The Nomination Committee was provided with the aforementioned
objectives that are to be taken into account when nominating
candidates.  The Supervisory Board does not,  however,  have a right to
nominate candidates for the election of employee representatives to the
Supervisory Board.  Notwithstanding the above,  the Supervisory Board
members strive to achieve the aforementioned objectives while taking
into account the employee representatives. 
The Supervisory Board supervises and advises the Executive Board in
matters relating to the management of the company.  The Executive
Board reports to the Supervisory Board regularly,  expeditiously and
comprehensively on business development and planning as well as the
risk situation including compliance and coordinates the strategy of the
company and its implementation with the Supervisory Board.  Moreoverthe Executive Board provides the Supervisory Board with the annual
financial statements of adidas AG and the annual consolidated financial
statements of the adidas Group for its approval,  taking into consideration
the auditor's reports.  Certain business transactions and measures of the
Executive Board with particular significance are subject to Supervisory
Board approval. 

The members of the Supervisory Board are individually responsible for
undertaking any necessary training and further education measures
required for their tasks and,  in doing so,  are supported by adidas AG. 
The company informs the Supervisory Board regularly about current
legislative changes as well as opportunities for external training,  and
provides the Supervisory Board with relevant specialist literature. 
Every two years,  the Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee
examine the efficiency of their work,  including the collaboration with the
Executive Board.  Therefore,  suggestions for even better cooperation can
be made.  The examination is conducted using questionnaires covering
various areas and criteria of the Supervisory Board's work.  Interviews
are also conducted with several individual Supervisory Board members. 
Subsequently,  the results are discussed within the Supervisory
Board and/or Audit Committee.  The current efficiency examinations
commenced in December 2012.  The analysis of the questionnaires was
carried out by an external consultant.  The results of the Supervisory
Board's efficiency examination were presented and discussed at the
Supervisory Board meeting in February 2013.  No major efficiency
deficits were detected.  The results of the Audit Committee's efficiency
examination will be presented and discussed at one of its upcoming
meetings. 

Avoiding conflicts of interest
The members of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board disclose
any conflicts of interests to the Supervisory Board without any delay. 
Substantial transactions between the company and members of the
Executive Board or persons in close relationship with them require
Supervisory Board approval.  The Supervisory Board reports any conflicts
of interest,  as well as the handling thereof,  to the Annual General
Meeting.  In the year under review,  neither the members of the Executive
Board nor the members of the Supervisory Board faced conflicts of
interest  /   SUPERVISORY BOARD REPORT,  P.  46.

Declaration by the Executive Board and Supervisory Board of adidas AG
pursuant to § 161 German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz AktG)
on the German Corporate Governance Code
The Executive Board and Supervisory Board of adidas AG issued their last Declaration of Compliance pursuant to § 161 AktG on February 13,  2012. 
For the period from the publication of the last Declaration of Compliance up to June 15,  2012,  the following Declaration refers to the German
Corporate Governance Code (hereinafter referred to as the 'Code") as amended on May 26,  2010.  For the period as of June 16,  2012,  the
following declaration refers to the recommendations of the Code as amended on May 15,  2012,  which was published in the Federal Gazette on
June 15,  2012. 
The Executive Board and Supervisory Board of adidas AG declare that the recommendations of the 'Government Commission on the German
Corporate Governance Code" have been and are met with the following deviations:

Agreeing severance payment caps when concluding Executive Board service contracts
(section 423 subsection 4)
In accordance with the recommendations of the Code,  contracts with a term of more than three years provide for a severance payment cap.  We
believe that for contracts with a term of up to three years the short contractual term agreed in connection with further contractual provisions
offers sufficient protection from inappropriate severance payments.  Hence,  no formal severance payment cap is planned. 

This no longer counts as a deviation from the Code,  as the recommendation regarding performance-related Supervisory Board compensation
no longer exists as a recommendation in the new version of the Code dated May 15,  2012. 

Disclosure of the shares held by the individual members of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board or
financial instruments related thereto (section 66 sentence 1)
Insofar as no further statutory obligations exist,  we report the ownership of shares or related financial instruments if it exceeds 1% of the
shares issued by adidas AG,  but we do not report this on an individual basis for the members of the Boards.  Instead,  we publish the total
holdings of all members of the Executive Board and all members of the Supervisory Board separately in order to safeguard the Board members'
protectable interests.

Suggestions of the German Corporate Governance
Code fulfilled
The Code suggests that in the Corporate Governance Report statements
are also made on those suggestions that can be deviated from without
disclosure.  These statements have been integral to our reporting for
some time.  The suggestion that Supervisory Board meetings shall be
prepared separately by shareholder representatives and employee
representatives,  which our Supervisory Board follows if necessaryno longer exists as a suggestion in the new version of the Code dated
May 15,  2012.  We are thus now fully compliant with all suggestions.

Performance,  passion,  integrity and diversity are the values of our Group. 
They are actively lived by our Executive Board members,  Supervisory

thus reviewing our initial strategy and critically reflecting whether it is
possible to sustainably realise a social business model in the low-price

development of future sourcing models.

In close cooperation with the employee representatives,  we have
established a global network of designated local Compliance Officers
reporting directly to the Chief Compliance Officer of the Group as contact
persons,  to whom complaints and information concerning possible
compliance infringements can be reported.  The Chief Compliance Officer
regularly reports to the Executive Board on the further development of
the compliance programme and on major compliance cases,  which are
also reported to the Audit Committee.  Further,  he reports to the Audit
Committee at one of its meetings at least once a year concerning the
contents and the further development of the compliance programme. 

Transparency and protection of shareholders' interests

The Compliance Management System based on the Code of Conduct
is founded on three pillars: prevention,  detection and response. 
Guidelines and processes which provide all employees with clear and
precise behaviour instructions create an appropriate control,  audit
and reporting environment with the goal to ensure timely detection of
potential infringements of statutory regulations or internal guidelines. 
Appropriate sanction mechanisms are used to react promptly to possible
infringements.  Insights gained from the investigation of past violations
are used to continuously improve the risk and compliance system.  A vital
part of prevention is the web-based Code of Conduct training,  which is
mandatory for all employees worldwide,  as well as a web-based data
protection training.  Additionally,  the Group has a 'Marketing Guide" to
raise our employees' awareness with regard to data protection when in
contact with customers.  Employees who work in sales receive regular
personal training concerning matters of competition and anti-trust
law.  Before our products enter the market,  our Intellectual Property
department researches the technologies,  trademarks,  logos and
designs to identify possible infringements of the rights of third parties
as well as product safety.

Compensation Report 1)
For the adidas Group,  transparent and comprehensible reporting on the compensation of the Executive
Board and Supervisory Board are essential elements of good corporate governance.  In the followingwe summarise the principles of the compensation system and outline the structure and level of
Executive Board and Supervisory Board compensation.  We also report on the benefits which the
members of our Executive Board will receive in case of resignation from office or retirement. 

Compensation system for the Executive Board
Following preparation by the Supervisory Board's General Committeethe compensation system for our Executive Board and the total
compensation of each member of the Executive Board is determined and
regularly reviewed by the entire Supervisory Board.  The compensation
and personnel topics dealt with by the Supervisory Board and General
/ SEE
Committee are described in the Supervisory Board Report    
SUPERVISORY BOARD REPORT,  P.  46.  The compensation system was presented
to and adopted by the Annual General Meeting on May 10,  2012. 

20

56

The compensation system is geared towards creating and promoting
an incentive for successful,  sustainably value-oriented corporate
development and management.  The compensation of the Executive
Board members is designed to reflect the size and global orientation
of the Group as well as its economic situation and prospects.  It aims to
appropriately remunerate exceptional performance,  while diminishing
the overall target compensation when targets are not met.  Furthermorethe compensation is oriented towards the typical structure and level of
executive board compensation at comparable companies.  Taking into
account the compensation structure at the adidas Group,  the tasks and
the contribution of each Executive Board member to the Group's successtheir individual performance as well as the performance of the entire
Executive Board are considered when determining the compensation. 
Thus,  an appropriate level of compensation can be ensured. 

Components of the Executive Board compensation
The composition of the overall compensation is weighted more towards
the performance-related short-term and long-term compensation
components than towards the fixed components.  In the case of 100%
target achievement,  the target annual income of our Executive Board
members consists of a fixed compensation component amounting to
around one third and a variable,  i, e.  performance-related,  compensation
component amounting to around two thirds of the target amount.  The
individual compensation components are outlined as follows:

/  annual fixed salary is based on the tasks and responsibilities of
The
the individual Executive Board member.  It is paid in twelve monthly
instalments and remains unchanged for three years during the term
of the service agreement. 

/  variable compensation consists of a Performance Bonus payable
The
following the end of the respective financial year and a compensation
component with a long-term incentive effect (LTIP Bonus),  which is
based on the Long-Term Incentive Plan 2012/2014 (LTIP 2012/2014)
measured over a three-year period.  The variable compensation
components are designed in such a way that the incentive to achieve
the sustainable targets set for granting the LTIP Bonus is significantly
higher than the incentive to achieve the Performance Bonus. 
Corresponding contractual regulations ensure that this weighting will
also be maintained in the future.  More than 50% of the variable target
compensation component is based upon multi-year performance
criteria. 
The variable compensation components feature the following criteria:
/  Performance Bonus serves as compensation for the Executive
The
Board's performance in the past financial year in line with the
short-term development of the Group.  At the beginning of the
financial year,  the Supervisory Board determines the amount of the
target Performance Bonus based on a target achievement of 100%
(Bonus target amount) for each member of the Executive Board,  and
resolves upon the differently weighted performance criteria with
their respective explicit targets.  As criteria for the 2012 Performance
Bonus,  the Supervisory Board determined both the business-related
criteria (increase in net income attributable to shareholders and an
improvement in average operating working capital as a percentage
of sales) as well as the Executive Board members' individual
performance.  The target achievement of business-related criteria
can be rated with a maximum of 150% by the Supervisory Board.  At
the end of the financial year,  the Supervisory Board examines the
concrete target achievement of each Executive Board member and
determines the bonus amount depending on the respective degree of
target achievement. 
/  LTIP Bonus serves as compensation for the long-term
The
performance of the Executive Board in line with corporate planning. 
When determining the LTIP 2012/2014,  the Supervisory Board defined
the following performance criteria with different weightings:
/  increase in net income attributable to shareholders
/  increase in operating free cash flow
/  increase of adidas NEO label sales
/  development of the adidas AG share price.

1) The indicated amount reflects the 2011 Performance Bonus reduced by the individual repayment amounts. 
2)  he indicated amount corresponds to the amount placed in the reserves for the 2011 financial year based on the degree of target achievement as at the balance sheet date.  The payout amounts

for the compensation components with a long-term incentive effect are shown in detail below. 
3) Other benefits comprise contributions to pension insurance and non-monetary benefits resulting from the provision of a company car. 
4)  lenn Bennett's compensation components were granted in US dollars: fixed annual salary $ 660000,  car allowance $ 18000,  Performance Bonus $ 464000.  An exchange rate of 13922 $/€

(annual average rate 2011) was used as the basis for calculation. 

When calculating the LTIP Bonus payable following the three-year
period,  the weighted degrees of target achievement of the performance
criteria are accumulated and multiplied by the individual LTIP target
amount determined by the Supervisory Board for each Executive
Board member when the LTIP 2012/2014 was established.  For the
final evaluation of the Executive Board's performance,  qualitative
criteria are also taken into consideration.  The payout of the LTIP
2012/2014 is limited to a maximum of 150% of the individual LTIP
target amount (Cap).  If the overall degree of target achievement lies
below 50%,  the Executive Board member is not entitled to the LTIP
Bonus.  Once the Supervisory Board has resolved upon the amount
of the LTIP Bonus to be granted to each Executive Board memberthe Bonus will be paid upon approval of the 2014 consolidated annual
financial statements.  In the case of 100% target achievement,  for
the three-year period from 2012 to 2014,  an LTIP Bonus totalling
€ 12504 million (Herbert Hainer: € 4620 million; Glenn Bennett:
€ 2604 million; Robin J.  Stalker: € 2310 million; Erich Stamminger:
€ 2970 million) will be paid out in 2015.

to the company the amount of € 471683,  as a partial amount of the
Performance Bonuses granted.  The total compensation stated for the
2011 financial year is reduced by the bonus amount to be repaid by the
Executive Board members.

Other benefits and additional commitments
The Executive Board members receive other minor benefits which
are individually taxed as required.  These may include,  for exampleentertainment expenses,  contributions to pension insurance as well as
non-monetary benefits resulting from the provision of a company car. 
They do not receive any additional compensation for mandates within the
adidas Group.  The Executive Board members did not receive any loans or
advance payments from adidas AG. 

Pension commitments 
20

12

58

All members of the Executive Board have individual contractual pension
commitments which essentially include the following provisions:
/ The pensions which our active Executive Board members receive upon
reaching the age of 65 are based on a percentage of their individual
pensionable income.  This currently equals the individual fixed annual
salary stated in the table.  Starting from a base amount totalling 10%
of the pensionable income,  a module of 2% of the pensionable income
is formed for each full year of tenure as an Executive Board member. 
The pension payable to an Executive Board member can reach a
maximum level of 40% of the pensionable income. 
Herbert Hainer and Erich Stamminger,  who belonged to the group
of senior executives of adidas AG prior to their Executive Board
appointments,  will at the time of their retirement receive additional
payments from the 'Supplementary Retirement Provisions for Senior
Executives".  Until their appointment as Executive Board membersadidas AG had contributed pension components for Herbert Hainer
and Erich Stamminger under these supplementary provisions which
were introduced for all senior executives of the company in 1989. 
/  the event of occupational disability of an Executive Board member
In
prior to reaching the retirement age,  he receives a disability pension
amounting to the pension entitlements achieved up to this point. 
/ 
Survivor's benefits provide a pension for the spouse or partner
amounting to 50% of the pension entitlements up to this point,  and
15% or 30% for each dependent child as half-orphan or orphan; it
amounts to a maximum of 100% of the pension entitlements.  If an
Executive Board member dies during the term of his service contracthis spouse or partner receives or,  alternatively,  any dependent
children additionally receive the pro-rata annual fixed salary for the
month of death and the following three months but no longer than
until the agreed end date of the service contract. 
In the event of the retirement of an Executive Board member prior
to reaching the retirement age,  the non-forfeiture of the pension
entitlement will be in line with legal provisions. 
From the second year of pension payments,  the current pension
payments will increase on the anniversary of the initial pension payment
by at least 1% of the amount of the prior year pension and additionally
by any income from the pension trust fund allocable to the respective
Executive Board member. 

Commitments to Executive Board members upon
premature termination of tenure
Executive Board service contracts are usually agreed with a contractual
term of three years.  This term will be shortened accordingly if the
Executive Board member reaches the age of 65 prior to expiration. 
In the case of premature termination of tenure by mutual consent and
without good cause,  the following shall apply:
/  Executive Board members Glenn Bennett,  Robin J.  Stalker and
The
Erich Stamminger each receive a compensatory payment in the
amount of the payment claims for the remaining period of service
contract.  Due to the relatively short contractual terms of up to three
years,  a severance payment cap is not provided. 
The service contract of Herbert Hainer,  on the other hand,  which
has a contractual term of more than three years,  does provide for
 severance payment of a maximum of twice the overall annual
compensation,  limited to payment claims for the remaining period
of his service contract (Severance Payment Cap).  In this respect,  the
overall annual compensation means the overall compensation paid
to the Executive Board member,  as outlined in the compensation
report,  for the last full financial year prior to resignation from the
Executive Board while considering the expected total compensation
for the current financial year.  If Herbert Hainer's service contract is
terminated due to a change of control,  a possible severance payment
is limited to 150% of the Severance Payment Cap. 
/  the case of regular termination of the service contract,  i, e.  in the
In
case of non-renewal of the service contract or termination due to
reaching retirement age,  the respective Executive Board member
is entitled to a follow-up bonus as individually agreed.  This bonus
amounts to 75% for Glenn Bennett,  100% for Robin J.  Stalker,  and
125% each for Herbert Hainer and Erich Stamminger and is based
on the Performance Bonus granted to the respective Executive Board
member for the last full financial year.  The follow-up bonus is payable
in two tranches,  12 and 24 months following the end of the contract. 

Payments to former members of the Executive Board
and their surviving dependants
In 2012,  pension payments to former Executive Board members or
to their surviving dependants amounted to € 3336 million (2011:
€ 3261 million).  As at December 31,  2012,  the provisions for pension
entitlements of this group of persons totalled € 50826 million (2011:
€ 46150 million).  The dynamisation of the pension payments to former
Executive Board members is made in accordance with statutory
regulations or regulations under collective agreements unless a
surplus from the pension fund for former Executive Board members
is used after the commencement of retirement for an increase in
retirement benefits.

Our Share 1)
In 2012,  international stock markets and the adidas AG share increased considerably.  Further
progress in resolving the sovereign debt crisis in the euro area as well as robust US economic data
and expansionary Fed policies were major catalysts for strong market developments throughout
the year.  However,  disappointing economic data in the euro area,  slowing economic growth rates in
Greater China as well as the looming fiscal cliff in the USA temporarily weighed on financial markets. 
The DAX-30 and the MSCI World Textiles,  Apparel & Luxury Goods Index increased 29% and 26%respectively,  in 2012.  Due to consistently strong financial results throughout the year and market
participants' rising confidence in the adidas Group's Route 2015 strategic business plan,  the adidas AG
share outperformed both indices,  gaining 34% in the period.  With further balance sheet improvements
and the strong increase in the Group's net income attributable to shareholders excluding goodwill
impairment losses in 2012,  we intend to propose a 35% higher dividend compared to the prior year at
our 2013 Annual General Meeting. 

International stock markets maintain positive momentum 
20

12

60

In 2012,  international stock markets maintained the positive momentum
from the end of the prior year,  driven in particular by European and
Asian indices.  At the beginning of 2012,  international stock markets
improved significantly,  mainly due to measures from European
policymakers to resolve the sovereign debt crisis in the euro area.  In
addition,  investor confidence was also strengthened following a series
of solid US economic indicators.  However,  in the second quarter of
2012,  international stock markets reversed the positive trend and
suffered considerable losses.  This was mainly due to a worsening
of the sovereign debt crisis in the euro area,  fuelled by persistently
negative economic data reported in the region.  The emergence of more
and more indicators signalling a slowdown of growth of the US and,  in
particular,  the Chinese economy also contributed to negative investor
sentiment.  In the third quarter,  global stock markets recovered,  posting
considerable gains.  This development mainly reflected the reiteration of
central bank commitments,  in particular by the ECB,  to provide further
economic stimuli.  This more than offset the negative impact from
subdued macroeconomic indicators worldwide.  Despite the looming
fiscal cliff issues in the USA,  most international indices continued to gain
momentum in the fourth quarter.  This was attributable to the ongoing
relief in the euro debt crisis,  which included a new rescue package for
Greece as well as a recovery of leading indicators in China and Germany. 
Furthermore,  robust US economic data as well as an expansionary Fed
policy provided additional support.  As a result,  the DAX-30 and the MSCI
World Textiles,  Apparel & Luxury Goods Index increased 29% and 26%respectively  /

adidas AG share price outperforms market
At the beginning of the year,  our share traded positively,  supported
by several analyst recommendation and target price upgradesreflecting confidence in the positioning of the adidas Group's brands
and the Group's ability to benefit from the underlying strength of the
sporting goods market.  On March 7,  the publication of the Group's 2011
financial results as well as the confirmation of our 2012 outlook was
well received.  Nevertheless,  given the strong share price appreciation
up to that date,  some investors took profits,  resulting in a share price
correction on the day of the results release.  Towards the end of the first
quarter,  these losses were more than offset,  supported by favourable
market trends as well as successful investor relations marketing
activity.  At the beginning of the second quarter,  the adidas AG share
traded sideways,  outperforming the general market weakness.  The
announcement of better than expected first quarter results and an
improved outlook for the full year 2012 provided positive impetus

with the adidas AG share reaching a new all-time high of € 6316 on
May 2.  In June,  negative statements from several competitors in
China as well as worse than expected results released by one of the
adidas Group's major competitors were key negative catalysts and
weighed on the adidas AG share price.  In July and August,  the adidas
AG share progressed favourably as a result of positive comments by
market participants regarding our first half year results.  In Septemberpositive analyst commentary and target price upgrades prior to the
adidas Group Investor Field Trip to Carlsbad,  California,  provided
further stimuli to share price increases.  The event,  which took place
on September 20 and 21,  aimed at delivering additional insight into the
Group's Generation US 2015 growth plan and the strategy to sustain
the success of TaylorMade-adidas Golf as well as increasing investors'
understanding of the key pillars of Reebok's new fitness positioning. 
Benefiting from positive market feedback following the event,  the
adidas AG share gained steadily at the beginning of the fourth quarter. 
Following the release of our third quarter results on November 8,  the

adidas AG share historically outperforms
benchmark indices
The adidas Group is committed to continuously enhancing shareholder
value.  The long-term development of our share price reflects investor
confidence and the growth potential of our Group.  Over the last ten yearsour share has gained 227%.  This represents a clear outperformance of
the DAX-30,  which increased 163% during the period  /  
Table 01. 

adidas AG share member of important indices
The adidas AG share is included in a variety of high-quality indices
around the world,  most importantly the DAX-30 and the MSCI World
Textiles,  Apparel & Luxury Goods Index.  The DAX-30 is a blue chip stock
market index consisting of the 30 major German companies trading
on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.  The MSCI World Textiles,  Apparel
& Luxury Goods Index comprises our Group's major competitors.  At
December 31,  2012,  our weighting in the DAX-30,  which is calculated
on the basis of free float market capitalisation and twelve-month share
turnover,  was 213% (2011: 205%).  Our higher weighting compared to
the prior year was mainly a result of the increase in share turnover and
the market capitalisation of adidas AG.  Within the DAX-30,  we ranked
16 on market capitalisation (2011: 16) and 19 on turnover (2011: 21) at
year-end 2012.

The adidas Group strives to be the global leader in the sporting goods industry with brands built
upon a passion for sports and a sporting lifestyle.  Inspired by our heritage,  we know that a profound
understanding of the consumer and customer is essential to achieving this goal.  To anticipate and
respond to their needs,  we continuously strive to create a culture of innovation,  challenging ourselves
to break with convention and embrace change.  By harnessing this culture,  we push the boundaries
of products,  services and processes to strengthen our competitiveness and maximise the Group's
operational and financial performance.  This,  in turn,  will drive long-term value creation for our
shareholders.  To achieve this goal,  we have made strategic choices and will prioritise our investments

adidas Group reconfirms strategic goals 
from 2010 to 2015

In order to reach our Route 2015 strategic goals,  we have defined clear
strategic priorities.  These include:

In November 2010,  the Group unveiled its 2015 strategic business
plan named 'Route 2015",  which defines strategies and objectives for
the period up to 2015.  This plan is the most comprehensive the adidas
Group has ever developed,  incorporating all brands,  sales channels and
Group functions globally.  Based on its strong brands,  premium productsextensive global presence and its commitment to innovation and the
consumer,  the adidas Group aspires to grow its business significantly
until 2015. 
According to our plan,  total Group sales are targeted to grow 45% to
50% on a currency-neutral basis over the five-year period,  thereby
outperforming total market growth (both GDP and sporting goods
industry).  In addition,  we aim to grow our bottom line faster than the
top line.  It is targeted to grow annual earnings at a compound annual
growth rate of 15% and to reach an operating margin of 11% sustainably
by 2015.

In September 2012,  Management confirmed its Route 2015 aspirations
for the Group.  It also provided an update on its targets by segment
and by brand in light of the Group's performance in the first two years. 
For the adidas brand,  the 2015 goal was increased by € 600 million
to € 128 billion.  adidas Sport Performance sales are now projected
to reach € 89 billion (previously: € 85 billion),  with the increase in
expectations driven by record-breaking football sales and momentum
in the running and basketball categories.  Additionally,  sales
expectations for adidas Sport Style were increased to € 39 billion,  up
from € 37 billion,  due to the continuing strong global resonance of
adidas Originals and the solid performance of the adidas NEO label. 
At the Reebok brand,  taking into account the strategic decisions to
discontinue the NFL contract,  reduce exposure to lower-profit markets
such as India and Latin America,  as well as shift the reporting of
US-related NHL sales to Reebok-CCM Hockey,  Management now
expects sales of € 2 billion in 2015,  compared to its previous goal of
€ 3 billion.  The reduction of expectations for Reebok,  which is partly
offset by the projected increases at adidas,  results in a reduction in
the Wholesale segment revenue target to € 102 billion (previously:
€ 106 billion).  Retail segment sales expectations remain unchanged
at € 46 billion.  In Other Businesses,  which achieved its Route 2015
sales target of € 18 billion already in 2012,  2015 goals were raised
to € 22 billion.  This is driven by an exceptional performance so far
at TaylorMade-adidas Golf and the growth opportunities expected with
the acquisition of Adams Golf  /  
table 02. 

/  Clear brand positioning and prioritisation: We believe that we have
significant growth potential to exploit from our portfolio of brands.  The
majority of our targeted growth will come from Global Brands,  which
we anticipate will contribute over 80% of the Group's expected revenue
increase over the period /  
SEE GLOBAL BRANDS STRATEGY,  P.  78.  Areas
within the adidas and Reebok brands that have been identified as key
contributors to sustainable growth for the adidas Group include:

running and basketball categories.

our target consumer is shopping.  On our mission to become a best-inclass retailer,  we are already halfway to our Route 2015 goal to add
five points of margin in our Retail segment.  Given the strong results
from our HR programme SHINE,  our real estate optimisation projects
and benefits from the expansion of our Global Foundation Range,  we
are likely to exceed our original Retail margin target by one or two
points.  In manufacturing,  we are combatting inflation in the supply
chain by increasing our investments in automation and new production
techniques.  Also,  our investments in infrastructure such as the new
distribution centres in Osnabrueck/Germany,  China and Canada will
ensure we increase capacity in a cost-efficient way to service all of

Global Sales Strategy
The Global Sales function is responsible for the commercial activities of the adidas and Reebok brands. 
The function is organised in three distinctive channels Wholesale,  Retail and eCommerce.  By catering
to these three business models,  the Group aims to service multiple customer and consumer needs
in order to fully leverage brand potential,  be more responsive to market developments and manage
channel synergies by establishing best practices worldwide. 

Global Sales defines strategic priorities until 2015
The Global Sales function directs all local market organisations responsible for the distribution of the adidas and Reebok brands.  The key priority
of Global Sales is to design and implement state-of-the-art commercial
strategies that ultimately engage consumers with rewarding point-ofsale experiences. 
As part of our strategic business plan Route 2015,  the Global Sales
function has defined three strategic priorities:
/ 
Increase the share of controlled space to over 50% of Group sales by
2015. 
/ 
Implement an Integrated Distribution Roadmap to ensure further
growth and maximise brand potential in key demographic locations. 
/ 
Leverage cross-channel sales opportunities and range efficiencies.

The Global Sales function has identified North America,  Greater
China,  Russia/CIS,  Latin America,  Japan and the UK as key growth
markets  /   group strategy,  P.  68.  Of these markets,  the three attack
SEE
markets North America,  Greater China and Russia/CIS are targeted to
contribute around 50% of the sales increase we anticipate as part of
Route 2015. 

Focus on controlled space
Our brands must be competitive at the point of sale,  based on avail­
ability,  convenience and breadth of product offering.  As a result,  we are
continuously refining our distribution proposition with a strong focus on
controlled space. 
Controlled space includes:
/ Own retail
/ eCommerce
/ 
Mono-branded franchise stores
/ Shop-in-shops
/ 
Joint ventures with retail partners
/ 
Co-branded stores with sports organisations and other brands. 
These formats provide us with a high level of brand control as we either
manage the stores ourselves (i, e.  Retail and eCommerce) or we work
closely with our wholesale partners (e.g.  for mono-branded franchise
stores,  shop-in-shops,  joint ventures and co-branded stores) to ensure
the appropriate product offering and presentation at the point of sale.  We
intend to increase our controlled space initiatives to over 50% of Group 
sales by 2015 (2012: 45%).  This will mainly be driven by growth in our
Retail segment and the expansion of our own store base as well as by
growth initiatives within our Wholesale segment,  such as the expansion
of our franchise business. 

Integrated Distribution Roadmap to increase brand
presence and market share
In order to increase our global brand presence and ensure further
growth of our business,  our Global Sales function has set up a comprehensive initiative called 'Integrated Distribution Roadmap" (IDR).  The
initiative encompasses a joint approach between our three channelsallowing us to define how best to capture the consumer in the biggest
and most attractive cities around the world without cannibalising our
brands and distribution mix.  The roadmap is designed to ensure market
share growth in underpenetrated affluent metropolitan areas such as
New York City,  where the IDR has helped us to clearly map out several
potential new locations for increasing our brands' presence,  which we
are now beginning to execute upon. 

Online multi-channel growth toolkit
The online sales opportunity for our Group is enormous and has accelerated faster than previously expected.  It includes sales through our
own eCommerce channel as well as through our Wholesale channel (i, e. 
through online platforms of our Wholesale customers).  In 2012,  Global
Sales introduced the online multi-channel growth toolkit.  The purpose of
this toolkit is to support the growth potential and sales ambition across
Wholesale and eCommerce.  Ultimately,  we are aiming towards the
global alignment of our online activities across our sales channels and
different geographies to achieve higher speed,  more consistency and
increased consumer focus. 

Increasing range consistency globally
In 2011,  as part of a joint initiative between the Global Sales and Global
Brands functions,  we defined a 'Global Foundation Range" (GFR),  which
represents a set of products that must be sold through all our sales
channels globally.  This range continues to mature as additional products
are added and its commercial performance exceeds that of non-GFR
products.  We will continue to develop the GFR in 2013 to increase the
commonality of products displayed throughout our concept stores and to
drive their commercial performance,  e.g.  full-price sell-through.

Wholesale Strategy 
Retail Space Management to amplify our brands at POS

Our most important third-party retail channels are sporting goods
chains,  department stores,  independent sporting goods retailer buying
groups,  lifestyle retail chains and e-tailers.  In this respect,  Wholesale
strives to establish strong partnerships with the most dynamic retailers
in their respective channel of distribution by offering best-in-class
and tailored services.  To achieve this,  Wholesale has established the
following principles  /  
Diagram 01:

The two predominant models to drive the success of RSM for the adidas
Group are Franchising and Never-out-of-stock (NOOS). 

/ Franchising: Mono-branded store franchising is one of the Group's
prime growth opportunities as it offers superior brand presentation
while limiting investment requirements and costs.  Franchise stores
are financed and operated by franchise partners.  The adidas Group
normally contributes to the costs for brand-specific fixtures and fittings
each store has to be equipped with.  Furthermore,  we support our
franchise partners with a comprehensive franchise concept,  including
range propositions,  merchandising,  training concepts and guidelines
for store building and store operations.  This ensures that the quality of
the brand presentation and the service offered to the consumer are at
all times high and comparable to our own-retail stores.

Operation Implement industry-leading sales best practice to drive
sell-out. 
/ 
Relationships Build strong relationships with the leading and most
dynamic retailers to drive profitable market share growth. 
/ 
Team Develop a highly motivated and highly skilled sales team. 

Retail Space Management (RSM) comprises all business models
helping our Global Sales function to expand controlled space in retail. 
The business models we are bringing to our customers are designed
to amplify adidas and Reebok presence and visibility in-store.  To make
this a success,  Wholesale is cooperating with retailers along the entire
supply chain to the point of sale.  By helping to increase profitability
per square metre for the Group's retail partners as well as improving
product availability,  we can achieve higher customer satisfaction,  thus
driving share of retail shelf space. 

12

The main strategic objective of the Wholesale channel is to deliver
profitable market share growth.  To realise this,  Wholesale takes the
go-to-market strategies handed over by Global Brands and commercialises them within a defined framework across various third-party
retail channels. 

Innovative sales tools key to accelerate speed to market
Accelerating product creation is a key element to gain competitive edge
and,  ultimately,  to increase shelf space with our customers.  We have
therefore developed a virtual sell-in tool which allows us to offer a
holistic sample range to our retail partners.  This gives our sales force
the benefit of having a 'full range in their pocket".  The reduced amount
of samples used during the sell-in process increases speed to marketwhile at the same time saving costs.  This new tool has already been
introduced in several markets and product categories and is targeted to
cover in excess of 60% of all Wholesale pre-orders by 2013. 

/ NOOS: The NOOS programme comprises a core range of basic
articles,  mostly on an 18- to 24-month life cycle,  that are selling across
all third-party channels and markets.  Overall,  the NOOS replenishment
model secures high levels of product availability throughout the seasonallowing for quick adaptation to demand patterns.  Retailers have to
provide dedicated retail space,  co-invest in fixtures and fittings and
commit to a 'first fill" representing about 25% of total expected seasonal
demand to participate in this programme.  In return,  customers can profit
from significantly reduced inventory risk on these products.  Most NOOS
articles are on an end-to-end supply chain,  thus limiting the adidas
Group's inventory risk as we re-produce based on customer demand.

In 2013,  we will roll out several new RSM concepts.  In the USA,  the
adidas brand will further roll out its 'Home Court" shop-in-shop concept
aimed at the sporting goods retail channel.  In addition,  we will also see
an increasing focus on Reebok as the brand rolls out its Fit Hub concepts
to present its expanded fitness offering more comprehensively  /  
see
Global Brands Strategy,  p.  78. 

Harmonisation and standardisation of processes
to leverage best practices
Wholesale is constantly working on reducing complexity by implementing best operational practices across our entire wholesale activities.  A key area of focus in this respect is rolling out a trade terms policy
globally that rewards customer performance either by higher efficiency
(e.g.  in logistics),  cost savings or better sell-out support.  As part of this
effort,  we have established regular reporting,  delivering meaningful
benchmarks that allow us to better control our third-party retail support
activities. 

Customer and range segmentation to exploit market
potential 
20

12

74

Rolling out standardised product range packages around the globe is an
important part of the Group's Wholesale strategy.  The initiative involves
 customer segmentation strategy that facilitates the systematic
allocation of differentiated product packages to groups of comparable
customers.  With 40000 different partners around the world that operate
more than 100000 points of sale,  this segmentation is broadly based
on a distinction between sports and lifestyle retailers that either have
an up-market brand-driven positioning or a value-oriented commercial
positioning.  By best suiting their specific needs,  this provides a platform
to better exploit market potential.  In addition,  Wholesale continues to
partner with retailers on increasing the level and quality of sell-through
information the Group receives on a regular basis.  This creates a
mutually beneficial understanding of their needs.  At the same time,  this
helps us to drive incremental business opportunities and ensure globally
consistent distribution logic. 

Build strong relationships with leading and most dynamic
retailers
To win in the sporting goods industry,  we need to develop collaborative
and fact-based strategic plans with our leading customers.  In order to
ensure success,  we work together with our leading customers to jointly
identify and quantify the opportunities to improve our business in the
future.  To gain full customer understanding and to maximise customer
profitability,  we have been investing considerable resources to support
the tracking and analysing of sell-out and sell-through information.  This
will enable us to reach binding strategic partnership agreements to
realise joint business opportunities. 

PEAK people development programme to build the
best sales team
In order to activate our sales force and enable them to reach higher
levels of performance,  a people development and training framework
for Wholesale has been created called PEAK (Performance,  ExcellenceActivation and Knowledge).  The PEAK performance framework sets the
expectations for individual excellence in Wholesale.  In addition,  PEAK
also offers a guideline for desired behaviour and actions that support our
employees to become successful leaders in order to deliver on the Route
2015 strategic business plan. 

Retail Strategy
Our vision for Retail is to become a top retailer by delivering healthysustainable growth with outstanding return on investment.  Retail plays
an increasingly important role for the future of our Group and our brandsand is a key driver on our Route 2015 journey.  The reasons are manifold:
/  showcase the breadth of our brands (e.g.  brand centres). 
To
/  create distribution in markets which do not have traditional

/  grow another profitable distribution channel. 
To

In order to simplify the shape of our store chain,  we have clustered it into
three different types,  namely brand centres,  concept stores and factory
outlets. 
/  Brand centres are large stores carrying the full range of each of our
adidas sub-brands under one roof.  They are the bold and powerful
statements about the adidas brand's strength,  breadth and depth. 
This format will be kept to a limited number and only in exclusive
locations such as New York,  Paris or Shanghai. 
/  Concept stores are the commercial engine for sales and profit
across the Group's retail organisation,  upholding and accentuating
each brand's reputation.  There are adidas concept stores,  Originals
concept stores and Reebok concept stores. 
/ 
Factory outlets facilitate the controlled sale of excess stock returned
from our wholesale key and field accounts,  franchise partnersown-retail stores as well as eCommerce.  The stock is complemented
with a portion of planned production which creates a balanced
product offering aimed at maximising profitability.

In line with our strategic business plan Route 2015,  we will further invest
in our own-retail activities and will open up to 300 additional stores by
2015.  The majority of these store openings are planned in the emerging
markets,  particularly Russia. 
To execute on these pillars,  the strategic priorities for Retail have been
broken down into the 'Five P's": People,  Product,  Premises,  Processes
and Profit. 

People 
03   /  Reebok
Fit Hub store in New York City 
In 2012,  we continued to implement SHINE,  the adidas Group retail
field people management framework which enables Retail HR and
line managers to recruit,  develop,  evaluate and manage retail talent. 
We also continued to evolve SHINE by incorporating additional people
management tools,  such as the SHINE Secure System.  This platform
fully integrates the production,  translation,  hosting and secure distribution of the framework to all active HR and retail line managers.  At the
same time,  it provides full transparency on the entire process as well as
on market implementation and user access. 

Product 
The global strategic framework and guidelines for our own-retail activities are led by a central team.  This team works closely with our market
organisations to translate the strategy into actions and drive commercial
performance of our adidas and Reebok retail operations around the
globe. 

The key element of our product strategy in Retail is to ensure that
relevant products are presented through the Group's various retail
formats to match the intended consumer profile.  This requires a product
offering that is price-competitive,  simple to understand,  easy to find
and,  most importantly,  available at the right time and in the right place. 
We continue to drive a number of strategic initiatives in areas such as
product assortment,  range overlap and replenishment to achieve this
goal.  We launched a global 'merchandising manual" in 2012,  which gives
guidance to our merchandising teams around the world on how to best
buy and merchandise for our retail business.  In 2013,  we will focus on
further training and embedding these core merchandising principles
within our employees and our business.

The consumer and our employees are the primary reference points in
order to be successful.  One of the cornerstones of Route 2015 is greater
'consumer focus",  an ambition Retail constantly strives towards. 
Within our stores,  we aim to interpret and adapt to changing consumer
demand,  targeting a mix of new and loyal consumers,  whether it be
sports-active,  sports-inspired or casual consumers.  Therefore,  we
are building a commercially- and consumer-minded Retail back office
and field workforce that thinks and 'trades" like a vertical retailer,  and
whose highest priority is to serve the consumer.

Premises
The start of a pleasant shopping experience is the store.  It is the
meeting point between the consumer and the brands.  Therefore,  it is of
the highest importance that our retail environments are inspirationalathletic,  fun and interactive,  while at the same time being laid out clearly
and logically to make it easy to shop. 
In order to drive our sales per square metre,  Retail has set a clear
priority on optimising its real estate management process. 

20

Dedicated real-estate teams have been set up,  who make sure that:
/ 
Store location and store size fit to the local market.

The
/ 
Market share growth and increased market presence are in line with
our Integrated Distribution Roadmap,  which has been developed to
evaluate real-estate locations in the top 100 cities globally,  based on
various factors such as consumer profile and competitive landscape. 
We have also developed a new store design and layout for factory outlets
which offers an improved consumer journey and showcases products
in a more inspirational and easy-to-shop manner.  The first pilot stores
were remodelled according to the new design in 2012 and we will
perform additional transformations in 2013. 

Processes
To enable the adidas Group to become one of the top retailers in the
world,  it is essential to have systems and processes in place that fit to
 retail business model.  Accordingly,  we continue to make significant
investments in retail systems,  namely ERP,  merchandising and POS
systems.  Our largest undertaking has been the roll-out of the global
retail systems to Russia,  which was largely completed at the end of 2012. 

Exploit portfolio of brands 
Leverage global presence
and scale 
We also continue to drive supply chain enhancements through the adidas
NEO label,  which requires a shift from a sell-in push model to a more
sell-through-driven pull model.  This is necessary to increase in-season
flexibility,  be more responsive to changing trends and,  ultimatelycompete in fast-fashion retailing.  In the long term,  leveraging best
practices from applying a pull model will result in economies of scale for
the activities of the entire Group. 
Our in-store operations are constantly being refined with the objective
of achieving flawless execution,  operational excellence and stores that
look good visually.  We will take a significant step forward in 2013 with
further harmonisation of store operation standards and the definition
of a common 'operating rhythm" for our portfolio of stores.  This
initiative will not only help improve how each store runs its operationsit will also drive standardisation as we continually look for ways to
leverage our global presence and scale.  Furthermore,  an updated retail
communications portal will be introduced in 2013 which will improve
the communication flow between the retail back office and stores. 

Profit
Increasing the commerciality and profitability of the Group's existing
retail assets is the primary focus of all Retail teams,  particularly in light
of the pivotal role Retail has in achieving the adidas Group's Route 2015
targets.  We have defined operational KPIs benchmarked to best-inclass retailers in order to measure existing business performance and
evaluate potential investments.  Stores not achieving their required KPIs
will continue to be closed down.  New stores must be supported by a
business plan that meets predefined criteria.  Each new store opening
and remodelling is closely monitored to ensure that the targeted profitability and return on investment is accomplished.  In addition,  we will
continue to implement our people,  product,  premises and processes
strategies in order to maximise profit.

well-defined and coordinated go-to-market strategies.  Each brand is responsible for the execution of
its strategic focus by creating a constant stream of innovative and inspiring products and generating
communication strategies that represent each brand and category in an engaging and compelling way. 

Driving the long-term development of adidas and Reebok
To secure long-term sustainable growth for the Group,  Global Brands is
focused on driving the development of the adidas and Reebok brands. 
The overall strategic goal is to achieve qualitative,  sustainable growth
by building desirable brands in consumers' perception.  Global Brands
played a central role in the creation of Route 2015,  the adidas Group's
strategic business plan that was unveiled in 2010.  The adidas and
Reebok brands are expected to deliver more than 80% of the targeted
growth for the Group until 2015.

Areas within adidas and Reebok that were identified as key contributors
and game changers for the adidas Group include:
/ 
Gaining sales and market share in the key global categories running
and basketball with adidas Sport Performance. 
/ 
Expanding adidas Sport Style into fast fashion with the adidas NEO
label. 
/ 
Maintaining adidas Originals' strong momentum with the fashiondriven lifestyle consumer. 
/ 
Establishing Reebok as the leading fitness brand. 
Global Brands also plays a key role in bringing the efficiency initiatives
of Route 2015 to life,  by focusing on speed,  consistency and consumer
focus.  Among other things,  we are striving to present adidas and Reebok
in a more consistent way around the world in terms of ranges and
pricing.  In the long term,  this should lead to range size efficiencies and
gross margin optimisation.  One example of this is the creation of the
adidas 'Global Foundation Range",  which will be mandatory for all of our
markets and channels. 

Focus on the consumer
The consumer is at the heart of everything we do.  This is the first and
most important realisation,  and we must adhere to it to ensure the
long-term success of our brands.  As part of its function,  Global Brands
has mapped out our target consumer universe,  which spans from our
roots in sport,  the 'pure performer",  through to today's style setters
who have embraced sporting goods brands as part of their lifestyle 
/  
DIAGRAM 01. 

To be successful across consumer segments,  we acknowledge that a
strategy of mass production or mass marketing is no longer sufficient. 
Only by identifying and understanding consumers' buying habits,  their
fitness level,  their motivations and goals for doing sport and their
individual lifestyle can we create meaningful products,  services and
experiences that build a lasting impression.  In this respect,  we have
identified five key global trends which will be important to address with
our brands and sub-brands over the duration of Route 2015:

/  Fit for life: Sport is no longer just about competing and winning. 
Sport is becoming more embedded in consumers' everyday lifestyles. 
Motivations and goals are becoming more holistic,  fun,  socialising and
life-enhancing. 
/  You are what you know and what you do: Society is embracing a
life-long learning attitude,  and placing more emphasis on what we know
and do versus what we have and where we come from. 
/  Celebrating individuality: Consumers increasingly fulfil their desire
to differentiate themselves from one another by being more creative on
the one hand mixing and matching products and services they need,  and
on the other hand seeking personalised offerings tailored for them.  The
growth in social media continues to fuel more and more opportunities to
display individuality,  making it even more important. 
/  Together is better: There is an increasing need for meaningful social
interaction,  both online and offline,  as consumers become more mobileand digital technologies and social networks make it easier for them to
connect with like-minded people. 
/  Back to basics: For everyday life,  products and services are desired
to be simple and authentic,  making consumers' lives easier.  There is
 growing interest in outdoor activities and minimalistically designed
products,  reflecting the desire to reconnect and be in tune with nature.

Reebok,  in contrast,  is an American-inspired global brand with the clear
objective to become the world's leading fitness brand.  With Reebokwe aspire to make our consumers 'fit for life".  Innovation is rooted in
developing products,  technologies and programming which enable
consumers to live a healthy lifestyle and have fun doing it.  Reebok
connects with the fitness consumer wherever they are and however they
choose to stay fit whether it's training,  running,  walking,  dance,  yoga
or aerobics.  In addition,  Reebok Classics leverages the brand's fitness
heritage and represents the roots of the brand in the sports lifestyle
market  /  
DIAGRAM 02. 

Brand architecture and differentiation 
Each brand and sub-brand is responsible for bringing its own distinct
positioning to life,  through the creation of products and communications
that not only support the commercial functions in their day-to-day
business activities,  but also provide the platform and framework for
long-term market share and profitability improvements.  While adidas
and Reebok each have unique identities,  heritages,  technologiesdesigns and reputations,  the strategic principles and methods for driving
future sales growth and profitability improvements are common to both. 
These include:
/ 
Leadership in product innovation to excite and inspire the consumer. 
/ 
Marketing and communication leadership. 
/ 
Activation and validation via a relevant set of promotion partnerships. 
/ 
Extending brand reach and appeal through strategic partnerships. 

As a true global brand with German roots,  adidas is mainly targeting
competitive sports based on innovation and technology with adidas
Sport Performance.  This sub-brand is the multi-sport specialist.  Our
positioning in this respect clearly starts in producing the best products
to help make athletes better,  with a strong focus on football,  basketball
and running.  Furthermore,  we seek to leverage brand loyalty and
strength in innovation in other categories.  The sub-brands,  adidas
Originals and Sport Style,  strive to take the brand's unique heritage and
design leadership to capture further potential in the sports lifestyle and
fashion market.

We believe that our Group's multi-brand structure gives us an important
competitive advantage.  Through our brand architecture,  we seamlessly
cover the consumer segments we have defined,  catering to more
consumer needs,  while at the same time keeping clarity of brand
message and values.  In each case,  the positioning of adidas,  Reebok and
their respective sub-brands is based on their unique DNAs,  their history
and their values.

To match these trends and fulfil consumer demands,  Global Brands

Leadership in product innovation to excite and
inspire the consumer
Through Global Brands,  we are determined to address every consumer
in a specific and unique way with product initiatives that generate trade
and consumer interest. 
We believe that technological innovation is essential to sustainable
leadership in our industry.  By leveraging the extensive R&D expertise
within the Group,  adidas and Reebok continuously challenge the
boundaries of functionality and performance.  In addition,  innovation
plays a significant role in differentiating the adidas and Reebok product
offerings in the minds of consumers.

For example,  at adidas,  we focus our R&D efforts on advanced
cushioning solutions,  lightweight and digital sports technologies as well
as sustainable product innovation to ensure we continuously improve
the consumer's experience with our products.  At Reebok,  the innovation
focus is on fitness,  where the priority is creating products that enhance
and improve the consumer's fitness activities and help them reach or
exceed their fitness goals  /   RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT,  P.  105. 
SEE
By creating inspiring product and brand experiences,  adidas and Reebok
strive to enhance their positions as premium brands.  This,  in turn,  is
an important catalyst for sustaining and improving the brands' gross
margins,  making continuous innovation an important enabler for future
profitability improvements. 

Marketing and communication leadership
To be competitive in the sporting goods industry,  brands must have a
clear profile towards their target consumer.  To achieve this,  adidas
and Reebok are focused on creating inspirational and innovative brand
marketing campaigns and developing communication techniques that
strengthen their positioning,  build brand equity and thus support the
achievement of the Group's commercial goals.

 key tenet of our marketing and communication strategy is to harness
the emotion of sport and the benefits of a sporting lifestyle across all
communication channels.  Both adidas and Reebok regularly bring new
global marketing concepts to life,  which can be easily leveraged to create
simple and powerful brand messages and support an array of product
offerings. 
In addition,  Global Brands also endeavours to ensure all of its brands
are at the forefront of new communication techniques,  particularly
as the information flow becomes faster and faster.  To increase the
pace and relevance of our brands' communication with the consumerdigital marketing now acts as a backbone for all brand marketing
activities.  Whether through in-store or online customisation platformsdigital social networks,  mobile apps or digital broadcast mediumsthese methods are providing a new scope of consumer experience in
 real-time and cost-efficient way.  With consumers spending more
time online,  the adidas and Reebok digital strategies allow the brands
to move from campaign-based communication to developing deeper
relationships with their respective target audience.  In addition to adding
significant value to all our communication efforts,  our digital marketing
and social interaction with consumers also provide the brands with
accessible insights,  learnings and measurable results,  which in turn can
be utilised to drive long-term brand equity. 

In 2012,  adidas celebrated the breadth and depth of the brand across
sports,  street and style through several brand campaigns.  These
campaigns focused on increasing engagement with our core audience
by leveraging multiple digital platforms,  including the launch of the
new adidas, com 'go all in" platform,  providing new levels of access
to our products,  athletes,  celebrities and events.  The ClimaCool and
Predator Lethal Zones campaigns alone reached over 330 million
consumers worldwide.  In 2013,  adidas will further leverage its brand
assets,  product initiatives and major sporting events locally,  globally and
across categories,  with the goal of engaging in deeper conversations
with its key audience,  both online and offline.  Innovation messaging is
 key priority for the brand in 2013,  and it will focus on using innovative
ways to continue those deeper conversations,  amplifying the product
innovations that will be showcased throughout the year while taking the
brand experience to the next level. 
In 2012,  Reebok launched one of its largest integrated marketing
campaigns in recent years: 'The Sport of Fitness Has Arrived".  This
multi-touchpoint campaign leveraged traditional media such as TV,  print
and in-store,  but carried an even higher emphasis on digital and social
media elements,  including a re-launched Reebok, com site,  as well as a
number of impactful grassroots activities.  Through the lens of the fitness
movement – CrossFit Reebok introduced consumers around the world
to a new way of approaching fitness,  making Reebok's passion for fitness
apparent to all who engaged with the brand.  The goal of the campaign
was to highlight to consumers the fun,  passion and camaraderie that
fitness can deliver,  showcasing that everything they love about sport can
be found in fitness. 
In 2013,  Reebok will speak with a united voice for all its Fitness
categories and Classics.  The global campaign 'Live With Fire" aims to
inspire people to join the community of movement and demonstrates the
positive impact being fit can have on people's lives. 

Activation and validation via a relevant set of
promotion partnerships
The utilisation of promotion partners such as federations,  teamsleagues,  events and individuals is an important part of endorsing
brand positioning,  and an area to which the Group dedicates
significant resources.  This not only serves as a vehicle to showcase the
credentials of adidas and Reebok products in the performance arenait also facilitates the extension of the adidas and Reebok brands in
the sports-inspired lifestyle market.  Both adidas and Reebok follow a
partnership strategy geared to best reflect their respective positioning
in the market.

One of the guiding principles of adidas is to equip all athletes to achieve
their 'impossible".  As such,  adidas brings its passion for great products
to the biggest stages in the world,  with sponsorship agreements for the
FIFA World Cup,  the NBA,  the Boston Marathon,  the European Rugby
Cup and the upcoming IAAF World Championships in Moscow in 2013. 
These types of activities generate tremendous visibility for the brand. 
For example,  the 2012 London Olympic Games were an enormous
global platform to showcase adidas.  As official sponsor,  adidas
kitted out over 5000 athletes,  11 National Olympic Committees and
21 national sporting federations.  30% of medals were won by athletes
wearing adidas,  amongst them gold medallists David Rudisha,  Jessica
Ennis,  Andy Murray and the US women's gymnastics team.  adidas had
considerable success leveraging the event with the 'Take the Stage"
brand campaign,  featuring athletes and ambassadors such as Yohan
Blake,  Laura Trott,  Sally Pearson,  the Brownlee brothers,  Stefanie
Graf,  David Beckham and Haile Gebrselassie.  In addition,  adidas has an
extensive roster of high-profile sports teams such as Real Madrid,  AC
Milan,  Chelsea FC and FC Bayern Munich in football,  the New Zealand
All Blacks and France in rugby,  American universities such as UCLA and
Notre Dame,  as well as high-profile individuals such as four-time FIFA
World Player of the Year Lionel Messi,  basketball stars Derrick Rose
and Dwight Howard,  marathon legend Haile Gebrselassie,  athletic stars
Jessica Ennis and Yohan Blake,  American football quarterback Robert
Griffin III,  also known as 'RG3" and tennis stars Caroline Wozniacki and
Andy Murray.

To activate and validate its key concepts,  Reebok is partnering with some
of the most influential and accomplished people in the fitness industryas well as with other top athletes from traditional sports.  Reebok assets

Annie Thorisdottir,  as well as renowned yoga instructor Tara Stiles.  In
2013,  Reebok is also partnering with some of the premier fitness events
in the world,  such as the Reebok CrossFit Games,  the Spartan Race
series of obstacle races and the Red Bull X-Alps adventure race. 

Extending brand reach and appeal through
strategic partnerships
adidas and Reebok have both successfully pursued design and
co-branding strategies with complementary partners.  For exampleadidas has partnered with Yohji Yamamoto,  Stella McCartney and
Porsche Design,  designing sports-inspired fashion,  high-end functional
ranges or even luxury sportswear.  adidas Originals continues to engage
in unique collaborations in fashion,  such as with Jeremy Scott,  David
Beckham and Opening Ceremony,  ensuring that adidas remains relevant
to the style-conscious consumer. 
In 2012,  Reebok deepened its partnership with CrossFit,  which is one
of the fastest-growing fitness movements in the world.  Reebok will
focus on making strong connections even further beyond the CrossFit
community as the brand moves into 2013.  On the Classics side,  Reebok
and Alicia Keys announced a new and exciting partnership as well as
design collaboration.  Alicia Keys' first project was the launch of her own
signature Reebok 'AK" collection.

clear focus is on strengthening its resonance with 14- to 19-year-olds,  in
particular the high school athlete. 

Five performance benefits 
/   aining sales and market share with key growth


Key strategic pillars 
Everything at adidas Sport Performance reflects the spirit of Adi Dasslerthe founder of the company.  The main objective is simple: to make
athletes better.  Innovation is at the core of all adidas Sport Performance
products.  The brand innovates through its five performance benefits
(faster,  stronger,  smarter,  cooler,  more natural),  leverages major
sporting events and focuses on five key categories (Football,  BasketballRunning,  Training,  Outdoor). 

€ 11344 billion 
adidas the performance and lifestyle brand
adidas' mission is to be the leading and most loved sports brand in the
world.  One major lever to achieve this is the brand's broad and unique
product portfolio,  spanning from apparel and footwear for professional
athletes to premium fashion.  It allows adidas to address multiple
consumer needs,  exploit market opportunities from various angles
as well as be less affected by one-dimensional market risks.  adidas'
commitment to product innovation and its rich heritage differentiates
the brand from competitors and provides a solid platform for future
growth. 

To stay relevant as the performance brand,  five consumer benefits have
been identified which form the basis of the adidas innovation pipeline.  By
serving them,  adidas will remain at the forefront of the industry,  further
build on brand image and leverage its technologies and positioning
across all categories. 

/ Faster: To help athletes be faster,  adidas focuses on reducing
product weight,  making the lightest high-performance products on the
market,  brought to life via the adizero platform.  adizero products were
highly successful in all major categories in 2012.  For example,  adidas
Football created the next generation of the adizero f50 football bootand adidas Basketball launched its lightest basketball shoe,  the adizero
Crazy Light 2. 
/ Stronger: With adiPower,  adidas wants to own power enhancement
in sport.  This benefit includes products such as TechFit Powerweb
compression apparel,  with powerband support for more explosive
muscle power or the adiPower muscle-warming pants used by Olympic
gold medal cyclist Sir Chris Hoy.

/ Smarter: Through interactive products,  such as miCoach,  adidas
helps users to train and perform smarter.  The brand works with the best
athletes and coaches worldwide to provide coaching and customisable
training plans for athletes and teams on all levels,  helping them
to define and work towards their individual goals.  adidas has also
embarked on a partnership with Major League Soccer (MLS) to integrate
the adidas miCoach Elite System league-wide during 2013,  marking the
world's first 'smart league".  All 19 MLS clubs will use this data-tracking
technology,  which provides real-time performance metrics including
heart rate,  speed,  acceleration,  distance,  field position and power. 
/ Cooler: Utilising advanced materials and technologies,  these products
are geared to help the athlete to always have the right temperature
(cooler,  warmer,  wind protection,  etc. ).  This is served through the Clima
franchise,  which is already one of adidas' best-known franchises around
the world.  In 2012,  adidas launched two new ClimaCool models – Fresh
Ride and Seduction. 

2012 was a highly successful year for adidas Football,  with adidas
sponsored Spain winning the UEFA EURO 2012 and Chelsea FC becoming
the winner of the UEFA Champions League in an all-adidas final against
host club FC Bayern Munich.  The adizero f50 featuring miCoach has
changed the way football is played and how data is analysed.  The
introduction of Predator Lethal Zones marked the successful reignition
of the Predator family,  the most successful boot concept in football
history.  With these key events,  successes,  a series of cutting-edge
concepts and market-leading campaigns,  adidas Football was able to
achieve another record year in football.

/  More natural: Natural motion is a major trend in the sporting goods
industry.  Drawing on the brand's history,  experience and understanding
of the foot shape and body movement,  adidas creates products around
natural motion and will tailor these to individual sports.  In 2012,  adidas
launched the adipure Trainer 360,  a gym training shoe designed to build
natural strength,  agility and balance.

In 2013,  adidas will continue to innovate around all five performance
benefits,  supplementing and expanding upon existing product
technologies and introducing a number of entirely new innovations. 

Football: growing strong market position

key strategic priorities.  For over 50 years,  adidas has led all major
developments in boot,  ball and apparel technologies.  Building on its
success around major sporting events,  the brand strives to increase
its strong market position by continuously creating the industry's
top products and fully leveraging its outstanding portfolio of sports
marketing partners.

Outdoor: adidas the athletic brand in the outdoors 
Training is the biggest Sport Performance category,  supporting the
preparation and recovery needs of athletes across all disciplines and all
levels by enabling them to achieve their goals to become the best in their

adidas has a long history in outdoor.  In 1978,  adidas and climbing legend
Reinhold Messner developed a new generation of boots,  which he used
to reach base camp on his way to becoming the first man to climb Mount
Everest without artificial oxygen.  With this heritage and the projected
growth in the outdoor sports sector,  adidas invested into building an
authentic,  performance-oriented market position.  Today,  adidas offers
 holistic product range for mountaineers,  climbers,  hikers and other
outdoor athletes,  including technical footwear,  apparel,  backpacks
and eyewear featuring cutting-edge adidas developments alongside
renowned partner technologies.  As innovation is key to reach recognition
in the outdoor industry,  the internal development and innovations team
cooperates with partners such as Gore-Tex,  Windstopper,  Primaloft and
Continental. 

 strategic priority is adidas Training's dedication to complement
its best-in-class product offering with revolutionary new consumer
experiences.  Insights from top athletes and leading athlete performance
authorities led to significant updates of miCoach and adidas Core
Performance digital initiatives.  This enables the brand to constantly
refresh digital content which is used for consumer interaction,  providing
exercise guidelines and best-in-class services.

adidas Originals: the iconic sportswear brand
of the street
To be successful in this market segment,  brand credibility and heritage
is an important prerequisite.  As the first brand to credibly leverage
its sports assets in the lifestyle area,  adidas Originals is regarded as
 legitimate sports lifestyle brand.  For well over a decade,  adidas
Originals has been offering a holistic range of products aimed at the
16- to 24-year-old consumer. 
To ensure sustainable success,  adidas Originals has to keep up to date
with and set trends as well as remain committed to serving consumer
groups who are constantly looking for more options to express
their individuality.  To address these needs and maximise business
opportunities,  a three-tier strategy has been chosen:

20

12

86

/  Innovative partnerships: adidas Originals establishes innovative
partnerships with designers and retailers such as Jeremy Scott and
Opening Ceremony.  In addition,  the brand constantly searches for new
expressions of street fashion. 
/  Extending addressable market: adidas Originals continuously
develops new offerings to extend its messages into wider business
segments such as Denim,  Women's and Kids.  Most recently,  the Action
Sports division released a range of snowboard products and will expand
into surf. 
/  Providing variety to a wide audience: adidas Originals commercialises
concepts such as adicolor,  particularly through controlled-space
initiatives,  where consumers can find their most-loved,  trend-driving
silhouettes in a wide colour range.  The consistent product range
approach used throughout adidas Originals ensures that every product
can be cross-merchandised,  creating a cohesive look and reliable brand
story. 
Furthermore,  to stay connected and to learn what resonates with and
inspires its target consumer,  adidas Originals engages with them
through a constant stream of digital content and conversation on all
major social media platforms and blogs.  For example,  adidas Originals
has over 18 million fans on Facebook.  Through these media,  the brand
incorporates itself into consumers' everyday lives,  becoming part of
their social groups' conversations. 

In 2012,  adidas Originals celebrated 40 Years of the Trefoil.  This was
creatively integrated into products with graphics,  golden trefoils and
other tributes to the brand's iconic heritage.  Leveraging the UEFA EURO
2012 and the Olympic Games,  adidas Originals also created sportier
silhouettes,  providing stylish answers through bold,  focused collections. 
In 2013,  adidas Originals will focus on Street Running,  Lifestyle Tennis
and Street Basketball.  These stories will be pushed across all distribution
channels.  Exciting design collaborations will continue with partners
such as Undefeated & Bathing Ape and Tokyo streetwear brand Bedwin
& The Heartbreakers.  In addition,  the Kids category will strengthen its
partnerships with Disney and Marvel Comics. 

adidas NEO label: the lifestyle label for the young teen
The adidas NEO label is a key strategic pillar for driving growth for the
adidas brand.  To ensure success in this more lifestyle-driven businessthe adidas formula is to focus on the younger consumer with a 'fast
fashion" business model.  This means quick reaction to emerging trends
through shorter lead times and excellence in retail execution.  adidas
NEO specifically appeals to the young fashionable teen,  aged between
14 and 19 years old,  with the 16-year-old as the sweet spot.  Those teens
live for now.  They are ready to go,  discovering their own way and style. 
adidas NEO offers stylish products for those more price-conscious
consumers,  who look for seasonal fashion items with a sports casual
flavour and constant newness. 
The label puts a strong focus on young girls and,  to increase the brand's
visibility among them,  adidas contracted two teen stars and fashion
icons in 2012: Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez.  Subsequently,  its social
media results increased significantly.  The number of Facebook fans rose
to over 12 million by year-end 2012,  supported by the Justin and Selena
partnership.

cooperation launching its first women's collection and introducing it

Hantuchova.  Highlight products such as the Made in Germany Cleat II

The fitness brand
Reebok has a clear objective to become the leading fitness brand
in the world.  Fitness is in the DNA of Reebok,  having played an
important part in its heritage.  In the 1980s,  Reebok helped usher in
the aerobics movement with groundbreaking,  game-changing products
and marketing.  While the sporting goods industry and the world have
changed considerably since then,  the role of fitness in society remains
one of the largest unconsolidated market opportunities. 
Reebok acknowledges that society has gone from a world of fitness
participants to a more engaged world of fitness enthusiasts.  These
are the people we define as the core Reebok consumer.  It is because
of this that Reebok wants to help shift the paradigm and change the
perception of fitness,  evolving it from a chore to a series of activities and
 lifestyle choice.  Therefore,  Reebok is on a mission to empower people
to be 'fit for life",  supporting them to achieve their full potential in a funcollaborative and engaging way.  In 2013,  Reebok will be considerably
expanding its fitness offering and broadening its communication of what
the brand stands for and what it means to wear Reebok.

Walking: injecting new ideas into a proven category
Historically a core business for Reebok,  walking is the most natural and
ingrained movement in the consumer's daily life.  In addition,  walking is
 core fitness activity.  For some,  it is an entry into other fitness activitiesfor others it is the activity of choice.  Reebok is injecting fresh energy and
ideas into the Walking category,  with key technologies such as DMX and
RealFlex.  In addition,  Reebok is reinventing its Trail walking range with
the all-new Reebok One Quest,  as well as a partnership with the Red
Bull X-Alps adventure race. 

Classics: leveraging partnerships and introducing
commercial range
Reebok Classics represents the historic fitness roots of the Reebok
brand.  Classics speaks to the consumer who wants to demonstrate
 fitness lifestyle and values trend-right products that fit their mobile
lifestyle. 
Reebok Classics is focused on three key areas:
/ 
Always Classic: timeless,  athletic-inspired silhouettes that are the
foundation of Reebok's Classics business,  balancing fashion and
tradition. 
/ 
New Classics: retro silhouettes that are either true bring-backs
(re-engineered from the archives) or inspired by Reebok's heritage
in the '80s and '90s. 
/ 
Heritage: new silhouettes that are inspired by the Reebok Classics
DNA and modernised with trend influences for today's fashion
consumer. 
In 2012,  Reebok celebrated important milestones for some of its most
iconic fitness models: the 25th anniversary of the Workout Plus and the
30th anniversary of the Freestyle.  Reebok also launched the campaign
'what it takes to become a classic".  The brand profiled the journey of
musicians and performers from around the world who have worked
hard to pursue their dreams,  and featured artists such as Alicia KeysRick Ross,  Tyga and Verbal and Labrinth.  In 2013,  Reebok will build
on these collaborations and will also add a new commercial offering
called Reebok Royal Flag.  Reebok Royal Flag offers trend-right casual
footwear with optimal value for commercial channels of distributionwhile at the same time providing improved margins and efficiencies as
 core global range.  Reebok Royal Flag focuses on comfort,  style and
accessibility with a strong assortment of timeless and trend silhouettes. 
Additionally,  a unique selling point is that every model has a royal blue
Ortholite sockliner for lightweight cushioning.  This offers a comfort
story normally only available on high-end products at an accessible price
point.  The flagship model is the Reebok Royal CI Jogger,  which offers a
retro running look and epitomises the clean and fresh design available
from this collection. 

Reebok Kids: focusing on fun
For Reebok Kids,  the brand is focused on the fun in functionality.  Herethe brand's success has been driven by key product takedowns as well
as innovative and style-right kids-only products.  For example,  ZigTech in
particular continues to be a major success for the Reebok Kids business. 
In 2013,  one of the key launches in this category will be the ATV shoe.

Improving performance identity through the Reebok Delta
Being 'fit for life" means being fit physically,  mentally and socially. 
These three ideals are what led to the formation of the Reebok
Delta as a new,  aspirational symbol of the brand.  For Reebok,  it
represents the transformational power of fitness.  Fitness transforms
individuals – making them more powerful,  more confident and capable
of realising their full potential.  Products that carry the Reebok Delta logo
are the pinnacle fitness products for a variety of activities  /

For the fitness consumer or the consumer who aspires to live a fitter
lifestyle,  the campaign will inspire them to live a life of passion,  intent
and purpose to not just live,  but to 'Live with Fire"  /

Accelerating investment in controlled space
In line with our overall Group goal to increase controlled space,  Reebok
is developing a strategy to create a deeper engagement with the fitness
community by going beyond what traditional retail has to offer.  In this
respect,  in 2012,  Reebok introduced the Reebok Fit Hub.  With the Fit
Hub,  Reebok redesigned its retail environment to inspire people to moveto train,  to get fit and to have fun doing it.  At the Fit Hub,  people can find
innovative fitness and training products,  trusted advice,  guidance and
information on community-based fitness events.  Select Fit Hubs,  such
as the Fifth Avenue location in New York,  are situated in close proximity
to Reebok CrossFit boxes,  creating a complete fitness experience in one
environment.  In 2013,  together with the Retail Centre of ExcellenceReebok will begin a broader roll-out of this concept  /   Global sales

One key element of establishing Reebok's position as the fitness brand is
to develop strong grassroots partnerships.  Partnerships with CrossFitSpartan Race,  Red Bull X-Alps and key fitness influencers such as Tara
Stiles (Yoga) and Amy Dixon (Walking) validate the brand's ambition and
product credentials.  In addition,  beyond events and fitness celebritiesReebok intends to significantly increase grassroots-level activities
through a new instructor/coach programme in 2013.  The 'Reebok Delta

connection with the brand,  creating true brand ambassadors right at the

Marketing innovation and excellence in execution
TaylorMade-adidas Golf's ability to market its products in innovative
and effective ways has been critical to its success.  Great emphasis is
placed on creating compelling messages spread widely through a
variety of channels.  This includes television,  print,  social media,  public
relations and point of sale as well as demonstration events.  For examplein February 2012,  at the PGA Tour's Northern Trust Open,  TaylorMade
Tour Staff pros wore hats with a single heart on the front,  replacing the
usual TaylorMade logo.  The heart represented TaylorMade's 'Driver
Love" marketing campaign,  and television viewers were invited to text
to a specified number whenever they saw a 'heart hat" during the
tournament telecast for a chance to win an R11S driver. 

TaylorMade's continued commitment to leading every
major golf category
TaylorMade's priority is to become the leader in each individual golf
equipment category.  That means strengthening its position as the
number one metalwoods and irons brand and ascending to the top
market position in wedges,  putters,  balls and accessories. 

Metalwoods
TaylorMade is the clear market leader in metalwoods (drivers,  fairway
woods and hybrids),  driven by over a decade of relentless innovation and
product introductions.  In 2012,  this was again evident with RocketBallz
metalwoods,  whose combination of performance superiority,  tour
visibility,  powerful marketing and wide distribution led to a new
record-high market share for the brand.  At the same time,  the R11S
driver,  with its wide range of adjustability technologies for loft,  face
angle and movable weight,  was by far the top-selling adjustable driver
in the world  /  
PICTURE 02.  These products helped elevate TaylorMade's
metalwood market share in the USA to 47% in 2012 from 35% in the
prior year.

Just before the start of the London 2012 Olympic Games,  Dustin Johnson
and Sergio Garcia lofted wedge shots to a floating green on the River

Original ideas like these and a keen ability to execute them on a high
level continue to set TaylorMade-adidas Golf's marketing apart from
that of its competitors. 

Effective retail and e-commerce strategy leverages
key accounts and assets
TaylorMade-adidas Golf makes it a point to create compelling pointof-sale displays and communications designed to quickly and clearly
educate the consumer on the product benefits of all four brands. 
Furthermore,  TaylorMade-adidas Golf works closely with its key retail
partners to ensure a consistent and excellent retail experience for the
consumer.  Core channels include green grass retailers,  off-course golf
specialty retailers and sporting goods retail formats with golf-specific
departments.  TaylorMade-adidas Golf also maintains a close relationship

Golfers of all levels are influenced by what the best professional
players in the world play with and wear.  Hence,  TaylorMade-adidas
Golf's leadership and presence on the world's major professional golf
tours is imperative to increasing brand exposure and traction among
consumers.  To attract the most talented players,  TaylorMade-adidas
Golf offers a comprehensive service to the world's leading players.  The

TaylorMade Tour Staff members,  dozens of other tour professionals also

one driver on the world's six major tours.  The visibility and credibility
that TaylorMade enjoys from this widespread use of its equipment is

To continue its momentum in this category,  TaylorMade will introduce
two new models in 2013,  incorporating its latest technologies.  The R1
driver offers twelve loft-and-lie settings,  seven face-angle positions and
movable weight technology.  The wide range of loft adjustments lends a
tremendous advantage to the player.  TaylorMade studies indicate that
approximately 80% of golfers are playing a driver with the wrong loft
for their swing,  and are losing distance because of it.  TaylorMade will
also introduce the next generation of RocketBallz metalwoods,  called
RBZ Stage 2.  These fairway woods and Rescue clubs promote another
dramatic leap in performance.

In 2012,  TaylorMade secured its leading position in the irons category in
the USA,  driven by the success of the RocketBallz iron,  the best-selling
model during the year in the USA.  Having gained significant credibility
in this category over the last five years,  2013 sees the launch of a
game-changing innovation with the potential to significantly extend
the brand's market share lead.  Introduced towards the end of 2012RocketBladez irons incorporate a Speed Pocket concept.  The Speed
Pocket technology provides a slot in the sole that helps the clubface
to flex faster at impact,  promoting increased ball speed and a higher
launch angle to give more distance.  The Speed Pocket also generates
significantly higher ball speed on shots hit low on the clubface,  where
the majority of iron mis-hits occur,  and works in conjunction with a
new,  ultra-thin face design to promote consistent distance from shot to
shot  /

offerings such as the ATV (All-Terrain Versatility) wedge,  with its
innovative sole that makes it highly effective from a wide variety of lies. 
The ATV was played widely on tour in 2012,  and in the USA it rose to be a
best-selling wedge at retail during October 2012. 

Putters
TaylorMade's Ghost line of putters was used numerous times to win major
tour events in 2012,  and continued to perform well in the marketplace. 
This success was led by the Ghost Spider line,  engineered to deliver
exceptional stability and forgiveness.  A new addition to the Ghost Spider
line which will be introduced in 2013,  the Ghost Spider Daddy Long Legsis designed to deliver the next level of high-stability putter performance. 

Balls
In 2012,  TaylorMade renewed its commitment to growing market share
in balls,  especially the premium,  tour ball category.  In 2013,  TaylorMade
plans several new product launches,  including its newest tour ballLethal,  introduced in February 2013  /  
PICTURE 04.  In testing,  the ball has
received high praise for its outstanding combination of distance,  feelcontrol and performance,  especially in windy conditions,  from the many
tour pros who have switched to it.  Other new ball introductions in 2013
include RocketBallz Urethane,  with its three-piece construction and a
tour-validated urethane cover priced well below most urethane balls. 
From a marketing standpoint,  TaylorMade will place extra emphasis
in 2013 on specifically targeting the multitude of golfers who have
purchased TaylorMade metalwoods and irons.

Accessories
Accessories such as gloves,  bags,  head covers,  towels and umbrellas
also play an important role in golf.  In 2012,  TaylorMade devoted
additional resources to improve on the design and functionality of its

Ashworth implemented a new brand strategy in 2012,  with a significant
focus on increasing tour presence and visibility.  This was accomplished by
increasing the size of its Tour Staff to more than 30 players and installing
Justin Rose as its new icon on the PGA Tour.  In addition,  Ashworth
introduced a new line of shirts called EZ-TEC2 with a performance fabric
that is breathable and quick-drying,  while also being exceptionally soft
and comfortable.  The brand also launched a new line of footwear,  the
Cardiff Mesh,  bringing the brand near the forefront of the spikeless golf
shoe category.  The result was Ashworth's best year since TaylorMadeadidas Golf acquired the brand in 2008. 
In 2013,  Ashworth will heighten consumer awareness and sales,  not
only through its increased tour presence but also through a new 'devilmay-care" marketing campaign designed to give the brand a livelier and
more contemporary image.  The goal of this campaign is also to widen

Capturing the potential of the women's opportunity 
The communication strategy at Rockport centres on metropolitan
professionals in motion,  expressing the benefit of 'style made
comfortable" in a fashion-relevant context. 
To underline the style competence,  Rockport started a close cooperation
with celebrity supermodel Erin Wasson in 2012.  As a model,  actress and
entrepreneur,  she resonates with the Rockport metropolitan professional
target consumer and the fashion-driven consumer alike  /

'Style made comfortable" campaign with Erin Wasson 
Expanding the product offering and distribution reach of the women's
business is the biggest growth opportunity for Rockport.  The women's
category represents around 70% of the global footwear market. 
Rockport's brand promise 'style made comfortable" is ideally suited
to and relevant for women.  By infusing adidas athletic shoe technologies
within a broad range of styles (e.g.  heels,  boots,  wedges),  Rockport aims
to deliver the  no compromise" combination of style and comfort,  which
is a true and largely unfulfilled consumer need. 
To ensure long-term success,  the brand is making significant
investments in world-class design,  development and manufacturing
capabilities.  To realise the full potential of the women's opportunity,  a
new Rockport Design Studio is opening in the Veneto region in Italy in
early 2013.  With this studio,  Rockport will gain direct access to the best
talent and industry knowledge in the field of women's design,  fashion
industry know-how and technical shoe development.

Globalisation continues to be successful 
To underline the product benefit,  a retail-focused lightness campaign
was successfully executed in 2012 to underpin the brand's positioning
in engineered comfort through lightness.  Building on this successRockport will intensify its lightness campaign in 2013. 

Leveraging the Group's infrastructure is one of the key enablers to further
expand the Rockport business globally in the next years.  Rockport also
continues to successfully grow its business in many markets outside
North America.  Regional offices have successfully been established in
Europe and Asia,  and sales outside the home market delivered 43% of
the total Rockport business in 2012. 

Expanding the retail footprint
Own-retail stores with a focus on full-price sell-through will be one
of the main growth drivers for the brand over the next years.  In 2012Rockport opened more than 40 stores in Russia/CIS,  Japan,  South Korea
and other markets around the world.  Rockport will continue to expand
its retail footprint in key markets during 2013,  to further strengthen the

Providing industry-leading availability
Building on the solid platform that has been established to ensure
product availability,  Global Operations is further shortening our orderto-delivery lead times.  This will be accomplished by establishing and
offering a set of tailored and sophisticated replenishment models to our
customers and own-retail activities via improvements in our planning
systems and processes.  The overarching goal of these initiatives is to
delay decisions on customer-specific order adjustments to the latest
possible point in time for increased flexibility in how we plan,  producedeliver and stock products. 

As part of the product availability priority,  Global Operations is building
five new supporting system solutions that use SAP as a basis to
standardise,  automate,  bundle and execute market processes and
system functionalities.  The roll-out of these systems and processes is
 prerequisite to enable enhanced value-added services (e.g.  labellingprice tags and RFID tags) at our factories and distribution centres.  These
are also critical for our flexible make-to-stock service,  which aims to
improve product availability and inventory utilisation by planning and
building inventory buffers at different locations further up the supply
chain. 
Other capabilities that the function is building include an increased level
of transparency on lead times in our supply chain.  This will allow for
more pro-active and accurate instructions on delivery times,  planning
and purchasing,  resulting in a reduction of workload and increased
customer satisfaction.  Another important aspect will be the introduction
of the capability to transfer inventory between locations in a more
automated manner. 

101
12

The Profitability Management department within Global Operations
assumes a central role in realising cost competitiveness by driving
our strategic costing efforts and optimising our buying strategies. 
Throughout 2012,  the team focused on developing and commencing
the implementation of specific workstreams within the 'Optimised
Costing and Buying" initiative aimed at capturing the value of range
efficiencies across our footwear supply base.  For 2013,  the aim is to
implement a more data-driven and standardised cost approach for the
apparel division which will,  in turn,  enable consistent benefit capture of
efficiency initiatives. 

In this context,  Global Operations is a key contributor to the Group's
/ SEE INTERNAL GROUP
Integrated Business Planning (IBP) project   
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM,  P.  124.  IBP forms part of the Group's strategic
business plan Route 2015 and aims at establishing a coherent end-to-end
demand and supply planning process across finance,  marketing and
operations.

In the area of manufacturing excellence for footwear,  automation
represents the key driver for efficiencies.  As part of this initiativewe support the implementation of state-of-the-art machinery and
solutions,  such as computer stitching,  high-frequency cutting and
automated production lines across factories,  and provide technical
competency training to factory-floor staff.  The resulting improvements
in the factories are both visible and tangible.  With less manual labour
required,  manufacturers were able to reduce operating space and
energy while increasing their right-first-time rate and optimising their
operator utilisation.  For apparel,  the mid- to long-term goal is to use the
manufacturing excellence initiative to roll out modular production lines
and Global Sewing Data (GSD) a globally recognised,  industry-leading
pre-determined motion time system.  It is an accurate and consistent
way to measure the standard production time or Standard Minute Value
(SMV) of a product.  All strategic apparel vendors joined this effort in 2012
and agreed on joint targets. 

Enabling later ordering
Enabling later ordering is a cross-functional priority in Global Operations
focused on allowing our customers and own-retail network to order our
products closer to the time of sale,  facilitating buying decisions that are
based on better market knowledge. 
This initiative for reducing standard lead times focuses on shortening
production lead times on footwear and apparel to 60 days.  Since the
majority of adidas footwear is already on 60 days,  the change will allow
us to align sales processes across the brands and improve efficiencies. 
The implementation for apparel started in early 2012,  with the goal to
transition a third of all styles for all brands to 60 days.  We successfully
achieved this target for the fall/winter season 2013,  where over 30% of
styles and more than 40% of forecast volume will be supplied on the
shortened lead time of 60 days.  As the project moves forward,  focus
will now shift to stabilising the 30% for future seasons.  Simultaneouslyour goal is to continue to increase the share of articles on 60 days or
less production lead time for critical ranges and high-volume productsspecifically targeting a global foundation range as well as regional
ranges.

Research and Development
Creating innovative products to meet the needs of professional and everyday athletes and consumers
is a prerequisite to strengthening our market position in the sporting goods industry.  In a rapidly
changing world,  our culture and passion for innovation and consistent investment in research and
development (R&D) is essential to the development of new product concepts,  processes and production
methods that are beneficial to our business objectives and our long-term sustainability ambitions. 
Our R&D teams have diverse professional competencies and backgrounds,  and their activities are
highly integrated and cross-functional.  In 2013,  R&D will focus on cushioning solutions,  lightweight
and digital sports technologies as well as sustainable product innovation. 

R&D within the adidas Group follows a decentralised approach. 
However,  fundamental research as well as expertise and competencies
in sustainable product creation are shared across the Group.  In line with
their strategic and long-term visions and distinctive positioning,  each
brand runs its own R&D activities,  generally with either a category or a
technology focus. 
R&D is closely integrated with the sourcing,  design and product
marketing functions.  At the beginning of the product creation processmarketing defines a development priority,  which,  in recent yearshas increasingly included sustainability targets.  This is derived on a
case-by-case basis from a combination of consumer research and
feedback,  competition analysis and own product testing. 
Independently from specific development requests,  our innovation
teams analyse new materials,  production processes and scientific
research frequently independent of the sporting goods industry to
increase the exchange and scope of idea generation.  Their scope also
extends to areas such as consumer insights and social media.  This helps
promote a holistic and innovation-focused culture which gives deeper
consumer insights,  while also fuelling creativity and synergies across
the organisation.  To identify innovative materials as well as integrate
sustainability,  cost and production process aspects into the development
phase,  the innovation team is in close contact with our sourcing and
material teams within product development who,  in turn,  work closely
with our suppliers. 
Once conceptualised,  new product technologies are engineered using
state-of-the-art systems.  Furthermore,  by embracing entirely new
production technology and material approaches,  product creation and
development can be decoupled from traditional processes.  This enables
paradigm shifts in products and in user experiences,  unattainable
through conventional development.  Extensive virtual prototype testing
and engineering loops are carried out on every technology,  which
promotes faster development phases as well as improved concept and
quality,  while simultaneously reducing physical material and resource
requirements.  Once a new product technology is deemed viable,  it is
produced as a physical sample.  These samples are then comprehensively
tested by a broad range of users,  including top athletes.  Only when these 
comprehensive tests have been successful are the technologies handed
over to product marketing,  which commercialises the technology to a
final product. 

Selective purchase of external R&D expertise
In addition to its internal R&D efforts,  the adidas Group also purchases
 limited amount of R&D expertise from well-established research
partners.  This strategy allows for greater flexibility and faster access to
know-how that may otherwise require considerable time and resources
if built up within the Group.  To increase efficiency and protect research
results,  collaborations are usually long-term and exclusive.  All projects
carried out with external partners are based on a clearly defined
mandate outlining the project scope to ensure consistency with the
Group's R&D focus.  Major adidas relationships exist with the University
of Calgary,  Canada,  the University of Michigan,  USA,  the University of
Loughborough,  UK,  the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg and the
University of Freiburg,  Germany. 
In 2012,  adidas and BASF,  a key material partner,  created a
groundbreaking material innovation called Boost,  which is being used
for the first time in running shoes.  To create Boost,  a solid granular
polymer of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) is processed in an entirely
new way,  forming small capsules in the material which makes up the
shoe's distinctive midsole.  With their unique cell structure,  these
capsules store and unleash energy more efficiently in every stride. 
Tests conducted by the adidas innovation team (ait. ) show that the
highly durable Boost material provides the highest energy return in the
running industry.  It was launched in early 2013 in a shoe called Energy
Boost.  Collaborative research studies with the University of Calgary led
to the development of the adizero Prime SP sprint shoe.  This product
played a leading role within the track and field range adidas provided
for the London 2012 Olympic Games.  The research studies conducted
together with the University of Calgary focused on the optimisation of
the stiffness of the lightweight carbon nanotube plate and the placement
of the shoe's spikes.  In 2012,  two scientific studies were carried out at
Loughborough University to evaluate the effectiveness of the adiPower
muscle-warming pants.  The studies proved this technology was able
to maintain muscle temperature at an optimum level between end of
warm-up and race start and therefore to increase sprint performance.

and patents by monitoring the marketplace for infringements and taking
action to prevent them.  This includes a vigorous anti-counterfeiting
programme.  We also have comprehensive processes,  and undertake
significant research,  to avoid infringement of third-party intellectual
property rights.  As we use a wide range of different technologies in
our products,  we are not dependent upon any single technology,  or any
patent rights related to any single technology  /   RISK AND OPPORTUNITY

Highly skilled technical personnel 
R&D expenses increase 12%

Our R&D departments comprise experienced and multi-skilled people
from different areas of technical expertise and from diverse cultural
backgrounds.  A significant part of our innovation process,  and therefore
personnel and skill base,  relates to consumer and user insights. 
Product designers,  engineers and sport scientists as well as material
engineering experts focus on product development.  These teams
are supported by project managers to coordinate execution.  Process
and production specialists also form an essential part of our product
development competencies.  Other professional backgrounds include
software development,  electronic engineering,  Finite Element Analysisadvanced CAD design and kinesiology. 

Each year,  we invest considerable resources into developing and
commercialising new technologies as well as fresh design ideas,  in
order to offer the best experience for our users.  R&D expenses include
expenses for personnel and administration,  but exclude other costs,  for
example those associated with the design aspect of the product creation
process  /   NOTE 02,  P.  197.  In 2012,  as in prior years,  all R&D costs were
SEE
expensed as incurred.  adidas Group R&D expenses increased 12% to
€ 128 million (2011: € 115 million) as a result of increases at the adidas
brand from initiatives relating to the development of lightweight and
intelligent products.  Personnel expenses represent the largest portion
of R&D expenses,  accounting for more than 69% of total R&D expenses. 
In 2012,  R&D expenses represented 21% of other operating expenses
as in the prior year.  R&D expenses as a percentage of sales remained
stable at 09% (2011: 09%)  /  
Table 02. 

We aim at improving our ability to adapt to changing consumer
preferences more quickly,  flexibly and efficiently.  We achieve this by
facilitating the direct interaction with and involvement of our suppliers in
product creation,  quality control,  product testing and commercialisation. 
In 2012,  we enhanced our computer simulation research platform to
further reduce the time to market of product innovations.  This software
system,  with its advanced material and design capabilities,  allows
for more creativity in the design phase and significantly improves the
level of product detailing.  While increasing speed and reducing the
need for physical product samples and testing in the R&D processthe benefits also translate into other Group commercial and efficiency
initiatives.  Advanced 3D models contributed to the Group's crossfunctional virtualisation project,  where in 2012 we reduced the number
of manufactured physical samples by over 20%.  An additional benefit
of creating virtual assets is their application in other areas,  such as
e-commerce,  computer games,  virtual merchandising and digital
communication. 

We believe developing industry-leading technologies and user
experiences is only one aspect of being an innovation leader.  Even more
important is the successful commercialisation of those technological
innovations,  while consistently increasing our commitment to sustainable
product development.  The awards we attained in 2012 highlight our
technology leadership within the sporting goods industry  /  
Table 04. 
As in prior years,  the majority of adidas Group sales were generated
with products newly introduced in the course of 2012.  New products tend
to have a higher gross margin compared to products which have been
in the market for more than one season.  As a result,  newly launched
products contributed over-proportionately to the Group's net income
in 2012.  We expect this development to continue in 2013 as our launch
schedule includes a full pipeline of innovative products  /   SUBSEQUENT

The adidas brand introduced numerous major product innovations
in 2012:
/  faster benefit was validated through the commercial and
The
performance successes of the ultra-lightweight adizero family of
products.  At the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games,  the
adizero Prime SP was the lightest sprint shoe at the Games,  weighing
just 99 grams.  It is adidas' lightest-ever fully commercialised sprint
shoe.  It was worn by sprinters Yohan Blake and Tyson Gay and British
heptathlete Jessica Ennis,  who were also involved in the creation of
the shoe. 
/ 
Other major adidas innovations introduced at these Olympic Games
were the adizero gld2o swimsuit,  which was less than half the weight
of the equivalent swimsuit for the preceding Olympic Games,  and the
adiPower muscle-warming pants.  This latter technology was used
by Olympic gold medallist Sir Chris Hoy and featured heat filaments
that sit over the cyclist's core muscle groups,  helping maintain
temperature between warm-up and the start of an event in a bid to
improve sprinting power. 
/  football,  the need for speed has never been greater and in
In
November 2012 the world's best player,  Lionel Messi,  unveiled the
next generation of the lightweight adizero f50 football boot with
miCoach.  Featuring an integrated SpeedCell,  a player's performance
can be measured with digital precision.  Additionally,  adidas also
extended the miCoach platform and introduced,  in association with
Major League Soccer (MLS) in the USA,  the miCoach Elite System for

In 2012,  Reebok presented several key product introductions:
/ 
Reebok expanded the highly successful ZigTech technology platformwhich features a unique zigzag-shaped lightweight foam sole that
is designed to absorb the impact of heel strike and return a wave
of energy along the length of the shoe.  A new,  more aggressively
designed,  more responsive version of ZigTech called ZigShark was
introduced.  A lighter-weight platform called ZigLite and a heel-only
version called ZigKick were also introduced. 
/  addition,  Reebok expanded the RealFlex technology pillar,  which
In
provides a point of difference in the rapidly expanding lightweight/
barefoot running segment,  by offering natural motion running with
cushioning and protection.  Multiple new RealFlex options were added
in the running and training segments to address specific activities. 
Also,  the new SmoothFlex platform was introduced to offer an even
more cushioned option. 
/ 
Finally,  a pure lightweight concept called SubLite,  based on a
proprietary Reebok outsole foam,  was introduced across multiple
categories.

TaylorMade-adidas Golf
At TaylorMade-adidas Golf,  current products (i, e.  products launched
in the last 18 months,  which is the typical product life cycle in golf)
represented 84% of total hardware sales in 2012 (2011: 78%).  Products
that had been brought to market three or more years ago accounted for
4% of sales in 2012 (2011: 5%). 
Among the highlight product launches in 2012 were:
/ 
TaylorMade introduced the R11S line of drivers,  which incorporates
 larger range of adjustability,  featuring TaylorMade's Adjustable
Sole Plate technology and proven Flight Control and Movable Weight
Technology. 
/  RocketBallz drivers,  also launched in 2012,  are faster and
The
longer thanks to new forward distribution of weight and better
aerodynamics.  With their stand-out white colour finish,  both the R11S
and the RocketBallz were retail hits in 2012.  The new RocketBallz
fairways and Rescues added significant distance,  more than any
products TaylorMade has ever made.  This was achieved via the new
Speed Pocket technology which promotes more ball speed,  while the
forward distribution of weight reduces ball spin.

Rockport launches truWalkZero architecture
Due to the different business model for the Rockport brand as a
leather shoe company,  the impact from new styles is significantly lower
compared to our other brands.  Products launched in 2012 accounted for
61% of sales (2011: 58%). 
The Rockport brand presented numerous interesting product
introductions during the year:
/ 
Rockport launched truWalkZero as its pinnacle concept to claim
ownership of lightness in the brown shoe industry.  The truWalkZero
architecture works with the foot's natural motion,  resulting in a more
comfortable,  energised stride.  Using adiPrene technology by adidastruWalkZero enables a soft heel strike,  transitioning to a smooth roll

Becoming the leader in the sporting goods industry depends upon the potential,  dedication,  knowledge
and performance of our employees and excellence of our leaders.  As such,  we place considerable
effort into creating a work environment that stimulates innovation,  team spirit,  engagement and
achievement.  By unlocking the talent of our workforce,  we bring to life our company's strategy and
drive business results. 

Commitment to leadership excellence
Bringing our corporate mission to life requires commitment.  We are
convinced that strong commitment from our workforce is dependent
on strong commitment from our Group's leadership to drive a highly
motivated and engaged workforce.  Therefore,  through our leadership
excellence programme,  we strive to create a work environment that
encourages and inspires every employee to work at his or her personal
best. 

In 2012,  we began a major global effort in this area by implementing
 consistent and comprehensive programme for every leadership
team across the adidas Group.  Almost 80 leadership teams at our
headquarters and globally are participating in these intensive team
and self-reflection sessions which incorporate 360 degree feedback
and leadership style awareness.  Leaders define team and individual
commitments and areas for improvement in order to work more
effectively as leadership teams. 
In addition,  we continue to support leadership excellence with best-inclass tools by conducting regular pulse checks and comprehensive
employee engagement surveys to identify,  monitor and track our
employees' opinions on their work environment.  This feedback is
reviewed regularly by senior management to develop action plans to
address key issues.

In 2012,  the adidas Group Human Resources department dedicated
considerable time to supporting the strategic business plan Route
2015,  facilitating organisational and cultural changes where applicable. 
In order to reach our Route 2015 targets and also based on the results
of the global engagement survey,  which was carried out in 2010,  three
strategic themes were derived and workstreams were formed around
'Leadership",  'People" and 'Capabilites" /

In addition,  we offer tailored graduate programmes.  The Business

management positions within our Group.  At year-end 2012,  12 employees

Our development programmes are complemented by apprenticeship and
internship programmes.  The adidas Group apprenticeship offers young
people who want to join our Group directly out of school the opportunity
to gain business experience in a three-year rotation programme.  The
programme includes vocational training in retail,  industrial management
and IT,  as well as integrated study programmes.  At the end of 2012we employed 56 apprentices in Germany (2011: 46) and 48 integrated
study programme students (2011: 30).  Our global internship programme
offers students three to six months of work experience within the adidas
Group.  It plays a key role in our recruiting strategy.  At the end of 2012,  we
employed 492 interns in Germany (2011: 330). 

Performance-driven remuneration system 
Performance management: Our global Performance Evaluation and
Planning tool (PEP) is the cornerstone of performance management at
the adidas Group.  Based on business targets as well as job tasks and
competencies,  each employee is evaluated and receives feedback at
least once a year.  Building on defined development goals,  we offer and
support our employees with targeted development activities both on and
off the job.  To further drive a high-performance culture within the adidas
Group,  we will roll out a new performance management tool in 2013.  The
new tool will create focus,  simplicity and alignment in setting team and
individual targets. 

Bonus programme: In order to allow our employees to participate in
the Group's success,  and to reward them for their target achievementwe have implemented a global bonus programme.  This programme
combines individual performance (measured in the PEP process) and
corporate performance (actual financial results measured against
Group,  channel,  brand,  division and/or business unit targets).  To further
drive a high-performance culture within the adidas Group,  we also plan
to make changes in 2013 to our bonus programme to support alignment
with business targets and put more emphasis on individual targets
through the rewarding element of the bonus programme. 

Succession management: The adidas Group succession management
approach aims to ensure stability and certainty in business continuity.  We
achieve this through a globally consistent succession plan which covers
successors for director level positions and above.  These positions and the
respective successors are regularly discussed by senior management
and reviewed by our global HR leadership teams.  The succession
management information shows a clear picture of the successor
readiness and development needs.  Based upon this information,  we
draft individual development plans to prepare successors for their
potential next tasks.  In addition,  we use the successor information to
create dynamic talent pools which provide us with further flexibility in
our succession management process.  All information is consolidated in
 succession management risk analysis. 

Profit participation programme: For employees at our Group
headquarters and our other locations in Germany who do not participate
in the bonus programme,  we have a profit participation programme
called the 'Champions Bonus". 

The succession management process is supported by a system solution
which is applied in 91% of the adidas Group's business units and will be
part of our Integrated Talent Management Process and System in 2013. 

We are committed to rewarding our employees with compensation
and benefit programmes that are competitive in the marketplace. 
Remuneration throughout the Group comprises fixed and variable
monetary compensation,  non-monetary rewards,  as well as other
intangible benefits.  The cornerstone of our rewards programme
is our Global Salary Management System which is used as a basis
for establishing and evaluating the value of employees' positions
and salaries in a market-driven and performance-oriented way.  In
addition to a fixed base salary,  we offer our employees various variable
compensation components. 

Long-term incentive programmes: In order to encourage sustainable
financial results as well as retain our top leadership,  the adidas Group
offers Long-Term Incentive Programmes (LTIP) for leaders and Executive
Board members.  We value the contributions of our leadership team and
provide this compensatory benefit to encourage continued performance
and commitment.  Other benefits include our 401-K pension plans in the
USA and the adidas Group pension plan for our employees in Germany. 
In 2012,  2501 employees participated in the latter,  which represents
48% of all eligible employees. 
Our Group subsidiaries also grant a variety of benefits to employeesdepending upon locally defined practices and country-specific
regulations and norms.

Online communication platforms to drive employee
engagement and learning
We believe that a robust internal communication platform is essential
for driving employee engagement and fostering learning and open
collaboration within our organisation.  For example,  the Group intranet
is based on blogs and wikis,  allowing departments and teams to
quickly build and edit their own internal communication platforms. 
We actively encourage employees to share knowledge,  collaborate and
discuss current topics.  As an example,  we have installed an 'Ask the
Management" platform on our intranet,  enabling employees to openly
address questions to our senior leaders which are then answered
promptly.  In 2012,  we further rolled out a best-in-class collaboration
platform enabling more dynamic and collaborative global interaction
throughout the adidas Group. 
In 2013,  we will implement a new Learning Management System in
which our training activities will be integrated.  The system will support
our Group's ambition to implement innovative learning tools and
approaches (e.g.  e-learning). 

Creating an attractive work environment

We aim to harmonise the commercial interests of the adidas Group
with the private and family needs of our employees.  Our Work-Life
Integration Programme includes family-oriented services,  flexible work
time and place,  people development and leadership competence related
to work-life integration. 
Diverse workforce to achieve global goals: As a global company,  we
understand that it takes people with different ideas,  strengths,  interests
and cultural backgrounds to ensure we achieve our goals.  A high degree
of diversity is already represented within our workforce.  At our Group's
global headquarters,  for example,  we have employees from more than
70 nations.  Our broad international employee population works in over
40 locations outside their 'home" countries.  As an employer who truly
believes in building global career opportunities for employees,  we see
value in nurturing global perspectives to be more readily able to meet
the needs of our global consumers. 

Focusing on mixed leadership talent,  diversity and work-life
integration: Diversity is one of the adidas Group's four core values.  We
strongly believe that mixed leadership teams contribute to the strength
of our company,  and we are committed to bringing this to life.  We have
joined other DAX-30 companies in an effort to increase the proportion
of women in management to between 32% and 35% by 2015 (currently:
28% worldwide).  To reach this goal,  we have increased the proportion
of women in our leadership development programmes to over 35% in
order to support our female employees to take leadership positions.  The
Supervisory Board of adidas AG has committed to increase the degree
of female representation to at least three female members at the next
election in 2014,  with at least one to be on the shareholders' side  /  
SEE
Corporate Governance Report including the Declaration on Corporate
Governance,  P.  51.  In 2012,  the adidas Group additionally became an active
member of the 'Charta der Vielfalt" ('Diversity Charter") in Germany
in order to share our best-practice knowledge regarding awareness of
diversity and inclusion in the work environment.  Our efforts to develop
mixed leadership talent have become increasingly recognised,  having
been awarded the 2012 'SIEgER  Gerechte Chancen in der Arbeitswelt"
('Fair Opportunities in the World of Work") by the Bavarian government
in Munich.  The prize is given to companies which have shown remarkable
engagement regarding gender balance and work-life integration.  The
adidas Group is focusing on programmes which give employees with
children the option to combine their careers with family life,  regardless
of gender.  In addition to providing flexible working arrangementsteleworking,  sabbaticals for family time and parent/child offices,  we
have had a child-care facility at our company premises in CantonUSA,  since 2002,  and in 2012 we began the construction of a day-care
centre for 110 children at our global headquarters in HerzogenaurachGermany.  The centre will go into operation by the end of 2013 and will
offer employees with children the opportunity to benefit from this facility
close to their workplace.  It will cater for children as young as three
months until they are of school age. 

In addition,  we have regular events highlighting diversity as a key
topic,  e.g.  our Diversity Day 2012 addressing topics such as 'Trends
for the future workplace",  'Gender Measure,  Share,  Progress" and
'Challenges & opportunities of a multi-generation workforce".

When it comes to highly qualified personnel,  the adidas Group continues
to face increasing competition in the international labour market.  Our
Employee Referral Programme was further expanded in 2012 and we
continue to give priority attention to this challenge to attract and retain
top talent. 

Employee engagement measured regularly
Against the background of our Route 2015 aspirations,  we need to make
sure our workforce is engaged and motivated.  Only then can we ensure
that we will achieve our ambitious Route 2015 targets.  Our Global Human
Resources department regularly carries out employee engagement
surveys,  the results of which enable us to develop the right focus and
future people strategies across our organisation. 
After our first global employee engagement survey in 2010,  we are
conducting a second survey in 2013.  With a comprehensive set of over
80 questions,  we ask our employees for feedback related to all areas
of their daily work life within our organisation.  We will concentrate on
keeping the surveys as consistent as possible so that we can reliably
compare previous and future results and measure improvements over
time.

Continuing to be the 'employer of choice": While the strength of our
brands attracts talented and qualified individuals,  we continue to
challenge ourselves to do what it takes to be and remain the employer
of choice.  In order to further strengthen this position,  we continued
recruiting activities at schools and universities throughout 2012,  to
foster our strong employer image through direct contact with top
graduates and students.  During 2012,  we again received some highly
rated rankings as an employer of choice,  including the Universum
Student Rankings,  World's Most Attractive Employers 2012 and Best
Place to Work (Australia).

Diverse sports activities for employees: In addition,  we offer our
employees a wide range of sports activities at our major sites,  in which
partly also their partners and family members can participate.  Employees
in Herzogenaurach,  Portland,  Canton and at other subsidiaries have
access to a company gym and numerous other sports facilities.  Our
Company Sports department in Herzogenaurach also organises various
team and individual sports activities.  In 2012,  the Company Sports

Sustainability
The adidas Group is responsible and accountable for developing and implementing sustainable business
practices that adhere to our operational needs as well as our social and environmental obligations.  As
 consequence,  we continuously engage with our various stakeholders in a collaborative way with the
goal of enhancing the social and environmental performance of the Group.  We believe that acting as a
good corporate citizen will improve our reputation and hence our economic value. 

Engaging with a variety of stakeholders

Workplace Standards set rules in the supply chain
We have a responsibility to our employees and the workers in our
suppliers' factories as well as the environment.  Malpractice in these
areas,  in particular human rights violations and dubious employment
practices,  can have a significant impact on the reputation and operational
efficiency of our Group and our suppliers.  Therefore,  covering labour
rights,  health and safety,  and environmental protection at our own sites
and our suppliers' factories is of the highest importance to us.  We have
defined rules and standards embedding our own corporate values as
well as those that society expects of global businesses.  These standards
follow International Labour Organization (ILO) and United Nations
conventions relating to human rights and employment practices,  as well
as the WFSGI model code of conduct.  We have condensed our rules into a
supplier code of conduct that we call our 'Workplace Standards".  These
Standards help us select manufacturing partners and serve as guiding
principles in the early identification and treatment of potential issues of
concern at our suppliers' sites. 

More information on the following topics is available on our website at
: //

Our Group's sustainability programme and strategy
Supply chain management
Stakeholder engagement
The 'Better Place" programme
Reporting and performance data
Our Group's Environmental Strategy 
To illustrate how suppliers should implement our Standards,  we
have created a set of detailed guidelines for use in factory settingswhich demonstrate our expectations for fair,  healthy,  safe workplace
conditions and environmentally sound factory operations.  The guidelines
are updated on a regular basis by our Social and Environmental Affairs
(SEA) team and are publicly available.  They are also used to determine
suppliers' compliance with our Standards and to advise and train our
suppliers in improving their social and environmental performance. 

Careful supplier selection
To improve working conditions throughout our supply chain,  Global
Operations works closely with our SEA team on supplier selection.  The
SEA team assesses all potential new suppliers,  and orders can only be
placed with a new supplier if SEA approval has been granted. 

Encouraging self-governance
We help our core business partners in establishing management
systems with internationally recognised standards such as ISO 14001
for environmental management or OHSAS 18000 for health and safety
management systems as we believe good management systems help
factories improve their day-to-day operations and support the process
of self-governance.  By running a certified management system,  our
suppliers demonstrate commitment to continuously enhancing their
performance.  We help them build and improve human resources systems
to maintain proper working conditions,  including factory grievance
systems to routinely find and fix non-compliance issues.  Furthermoreby enforcing employment standards at the sites of our manufacturing
suppliers,  we empower workers to protect their own rights and take an
active role in decision-making.

At the adidas Group,  we openly engage with numerous stakeholdersinvolving them in key social and environmental decisions that shape
day-to-day operations.  Through active participation in,  for example,  the
Better Cotton Initiative,  the Sustainable Apparel Coalition,  the Leather
Working Group and the AFIRM Working Group,  we work closely with
leading companies from a variety of sectors to develop sustainable
business approaches and to debate social and environmental topics on a
global level.  This is also supported by our membership in organisations
such as the World Federation of the Sporting Goods Industry (WFSGI)the Fair Factories Clearinghouse (FFC) and the Fair Labor Association
(FLA).  In addition,  we recognise that open and honest communication
enhances the transparency of our business and demonstrates our
commitment to being accountable.  In 2012,  our engagement with labour
and human rights groups specifically focused on the adidas Group's goal
to ensure compliance with the Sustainable Sourcing Code of the London
2012 Olympic Games and to show best practice in terms of supply chain
disclosure.

Training to achieve sustainable compliance 
01   /   Number of trainings 
As part of the adidas Group's continuous efforts to achieve more
effective and sustainable practices within its supply chain,  the Group has
initiated a system of multi-level and cross-functional training sessions
together with its global supplier network.  Our SEA team offers specific
training courses and workshops for factory supervisors and managers
to help them apply our Standards and implement best practices.  These
workshops include,  for example,  introductory training on our Workplace
Standards and SEA operating guidelines as well as detailed training
on effective health,  safety and environmental practices.  Furthermorewe promote the establishment of structures that actively involve
workers and management of our suppliers,  as well as local employee
associations and non-governmental organisations (NGOs).  In order
to strengthen personnel capacities throughout our company,  our SEA
team also organises workshops for licensees,  agents and adidas Group
business entities.  In this way,  the consideration of acceptable working
conditions becomes a routine part of our business activities.  In 2012the SEA team conducted 172 training sessions and workshops (2011:
170)  /

Warning-letter system to enforce compliance
Monitoring through factory inspection

118

The SEA team assesses compliance with the Workplace Standards by
means of factory inspections.  Our auditors check performance against a
customised risk list for each factory that is monitored.  The methodology
is linked to a factory rating which measures the effectiveness of
compliance systems and the work of their administrators.  This enables
us to precisely determine training needs at our suppliers' factories. 
During 2012,  we conducted 1564 factory visits (2011: 1591 visits)
involving management and worker interviews,  document reviewsfacility inspections and training sessions at different levels in our supply
chain  /  
DIAGRAM 02. 
In addition to our own monitoring activities,  we value independent
and unannounced assessment by third parties to demonstrate the
credibility of and provide verified information about our programme
to stakeholders.  As a member of the Fair Labor Association (FLA)the adidas Group is subject to external assessment by independent
monitors,  participation in the FLA third-party complaint system and
public reporting.  In 2005,  the monitoring programme of the adidas Group
was accredited by the FLA for the first time; re-accreditation took place
in 2008.  This decision was based on independent factory monitoring
and verification reports of supplier facilities and a thorough audit of
monitoring protocols,  training programmes and auditing systems.  The
next review and accreditation cycle by the FLA was rescheduled to 2013. 
Since joining the FLA,  more than 300 independent assessments have
been conducted at adidas Group suppliers. 

Where a manufacturing supplier is performing poorly in terms of
Workplace Standards compliance,  we work closely with them to find
solutions.  However,  when we find ongoing and serious instances
of non-compliance as well as a lack of commitment from factory
management to address the issues,  we send out a formal warning
letter including a notification to factory management that their business
relationship with the adidas Group is in jeopardy.  Overall,  three
warning letters result in a termination.  In 2012,  we terminated our
business relationship with ten suppliers for compliance reasons (2011:
13 terminations). 

Strategic approach to driving environmental progress
and tackling climate change
Tackling climate change poses a number of challenges for the adidas
Group and its manufacturing partners.  As a result of an analysis of
our environmental impacts,  we have put the Environmental Strategy
2015 in place.  The Strategy is targeted to substantially improve our
environmental footprint.  It follows a clear vision and sets specific targets
to be reached by 2015.  These targets cover corporate and management
processes reaching from product design and creation to sourcing and
manufacturing through to our stores and all other points of sale.  The
focus is on energy resources,  water conservation and discharge,  waste
and chemicals,  and on becoming more thoughtful and efficient in using
resources as well as helping reduce operational costs.  Our approach
is to manage environmental issues as an integral part of our daily
operations,  positively contributing to the adidas Group's overall business
performance.  More details on our Environmental Strategy can be found
on our website at  : //  
WWW. ADIDAS-GROUP. COM/SUSTAINABILITY.

As part of this initiative,  we have set Group-wide and site-specific 2015
targets related to carbon emissions,  savings in energy,  water and paper
consumption as well as sourcing green energy.  One of the key goals
within the Green Company initiative is to operate certified environmental
management systems at major sites of the adidas Group.  Overall,  by
2015,  we aim to reduce the relative carbon emissions at our own sites
by 30%.  By the end of 2012,  ten sites of the adidas Group had certified
environmental management systems in place.  Read more about the
Green Company programme and our performance achievements on our
website : //  
WWW. ADIDAS-GROUP. COM/SUSTAINABILITY. 

Sustainable materials
One key goal of our Environmental Strategy is to reduce the overall
environmental impact of materials used in our products.  We aim to find
materials that reduce waste or have less of an impact throughout their
whole life cycle.  The adidas Group has various initiatives in place that
help to achieve its goal to increase the usage of recycled and sustainable
materials. 
One example is our participation in the Better Cotton Initiative,  which was
co-founded by the adidas Group.  We are committed to using 100% Better
Cotton in all our products by 2018.  Better Cotton can be described as
sustainable cotton going mainstream,  i, e.  decreasing negative social and
environmental impacts of growing cotton by cutting water consumption
considerably and addressing pesticide management,  crop rotation and
sound working conditions.  In 2013,  we will continue to launch products
containing Better Cotton.  More information about Better Cotton can be
found on our website at  : //  
WWW. ADIDAS-GROUP. COM/SUSTAINABILITY. 
Another initiative is the adidas brand's sustainable product programme
'Better Place",  which works with different product creation teams,  as well
as cross-functional teams such as Sourcing,  Corporate Communication
and Global Operations to create a sustainable product offering within
the adidas Sport Performance and Sport Style ranges.  Some ways in
which 'Better Place" works with product creation teams to increase
sustainable products is through the utilisation of sustainable materialsenvironmental design and innovative manufacturing techniques within
the product creation process.  These actions,  or combinations of these
actions,  have allowed 'Better Place" to work with product creation
teams to create a larger sustainable product offering.  The first adidas
'Better Place" products were introduced globally in 2009 in response
to increasing consumer demand for sustainable sports apparel and
footwear.  These products have been a part of the adidas brand product
offering ever since. 

The number of adidas products that either reached or exceeded the
baseline 'Better Place" criteria has grown in recent years.  This growth
is supported by ongoing innovation in the area of sustainable product
construction and manufacturing techniques,  such as the low-waste
hot-runner injection technologies.  Hot runners are a technology brought
over from the automotive industry,  where injectable materials travel
through a heated channel directly from the machine to the mould,  only
using the needed material.  The result is no material overflow from the
mould. 
In 2012,  we focused on increasing the use of sustainable materials
such as recycled polyester,  organic and Better Cotton and bio-based
materials.  These environmentally preferred materials have replaced
conventional materials in many of our footwear and apparel products.  In
addition to increasing the use of environmentally preferred materials,  we
strive to continuously increase the range of more sustainable products by
developing sustainable product solutions and using innovative materials. 
For example,  in 2012,  all our footwear products reached the minimum
sustainability levels required by the 'Better Place" guidelines  /     Key
sustainable product initiatives in 2012. 

Driving environmental improvements in our supply chain
In our supply chain,  activities focus on helping suppliers establish
sound environmental management systems at their manufacturing
plants to best reduce their negative environmental impacts.  We have
guidelines and training programmes in place for our suppliers,  using the
environmental performance of our own production sites as best practice
examples. 
The majority of our footwear sourcing volume is produced in factories
which are OHSAS 18000 and/or ISO 14001 certified.  The remaining
part of our footwear sourcing volume is produced in factories that
have management systems in place but have not yet been certified.  All
footwear factories are regularly assessed against the adidas Group's
standards on environment and workplace health and safety.  In 2012,  we
introduced 'Environmental Key Performance Indicators" that allow us to
track the progress of environmental efforts undertaken by our strategic
suppliers.  Furthermore,  we have established a database to collect
environmental data from the factories of our core suppliers.  A range of
other activities have been implemented to reduce our carbon footprint
in the supply and distribution chain.  Examples of these are in the areas
of transportation and energy use.  In the transportation of our productsour policy is to minimise the impacts,  in particular from airfreight
shipments,  through improved order and production planning tools.

DryDye
/

DryDye is an innovative fabric dyeing technology that uses pressurised carbon dioxide to inject dye into fabric instead of waterwhich is the traditional medium for fabric dyeing.  This process saves roughly 25 litres of water for a t-shirt and reduces energy
and chemical use by approximately 50%.  adidas first used DryDye in summer 2012,  on a line of graphic tees.  50000 tees were
produced with a water saving of almost 25 million litres.  This technology will be utilised in a complete range including some
colours of the popular Training Prime t-shirt in spring/summer 2013 and will be expanded to include a larger colour palette and
more products in future seasons.

As London 2012 aimed to be the world's first truly sustainable Olympic and Paralympic Games,  sustainability was briefed into
on-field,  Volunteer,  presentation and torch bearer products.  90% of the adidas products for the London 2012 Olympic Games
contained sustainable content,  with 100% of athlete Village wear,  100% of Volunteer wear and 73% of on-field performance
products designed and developed as 'Better Place".  The London Volunteers' uniform was a prime example.  All items in the
Volunteer package contained,  at a minimum,  35% sustainable content,  with three quarters of the Volunteer clothing and accessories having at least 50% sustainable content.  Additionally,  all Volunteers wore the London version of the popular Fluid Trainer
shoe.  The Fluid Trainer is technically advanced in the area of sustainability,  with pattern innovations and sustainable content
that impact the whole shoe.  This shoe contains recycled polyester mesh,  recycled EVA,  as well as recycled rubber,  and has
achieved a 70% or greater pattern efficiency for every piece of the upper. 
From an on-field product perspective,  adidas also included sustainable materials and briefed sustainability into products
where possible,  while still maintaining adidas' strict performance standards and providing the athlete with a great,  sustainable
performance product. 

Primeknit
/

adidas is constantly researching new product innovations.  In summer 2012,  we released 2012 pairs of the Primeknit shoe for the
London 2012 Olympic Games,  a new innovation featuring a fully knit upper which results in no waste from the upper material. 
This knitted upper incorporates different knitting patterns for strength and breathability and uses recycled polyester yarn for
an upper that meets the high performance standards for an adidas running shoe while addressing the topic of sustainability.  As
this shoe can be knit using automated machinery,  it is an efficient technology that will be a game changer in the industry.  This
shoe offering will continue to grow past its initial first run,  and the technology will be expanded beyond the traditional running
silhouette to include an offering for other sports. 

We see sizeable business opportunities for our Group in the area of sustainable product concepts  /   RISK AND OPPORTUNITY

Control and monitoring of restricted substances
We have specified clear standards that follow the strictest local
regulations and best practice standards for consumer care and
safety.  These standards are mandatory for all business partners and
are updated regularly based on findings in our ongoing dialogue with
scientific organisations.  They cover all general requirements for
eco-labels and green seals (e.g.  ÖKO-Tex Standard 100,  Toxproof TÜV
Rheinland,  etc. ) for footwear,  apparel and hardware products.  Both
our own quality assurance laboratories and external testing institutes
are used to constantly monitor material samples to ensure supplier
compliance with these requirements.  Materials that do not meet our
standards and specifications are rejected. 
Furthermore,  it is the adidas Group's goal to work with suppliers and
the chemical industry on eliminating and reducing the discharge of
hazardous chemicals in our sphere of influence as far as possible. 
Besides our mature policies that ban or restrict chemicals in our
products,  we have also specified substances that cannot be used during
the manufacturing process because they can affect workers' health. 

Strong sustainability track record reflected in
index memberships
Interest from the financial community in sustainability management is
steadily increasing.  We appreciate positive recognition from international
institutions and rating agencies,  NGOs and socially responsible
investment (SRI) analysts.  Each year,  we respond to numerous
enquiries from socially responsible investors,  fund managers and
financial analysts.  They evaluate our efforts through in-depth analysis
of our sustainability programme,  including document review as well
as interviews with employees and management.  As a result,  adidas
AG has been included in a variety of high-profile sustainability indices 
/     ADIDAS AG IN SUSTAINABILITY INDICES.  For the 13th consecutive timein 2012,  adidas AG was selected to join the Dow Jones Sustainability

Internal Group Management System
The principal financial goal for increasing shareholder value at the adidas Group is maximising
operating cash flow.  We strive to achieve this goal by continually improving our top- and bottom-line
performance while at the same time optimising the use of invested capital.  Our Group's planning
and controlling system is therefore designed to provide a variety of tools to assess our current
performance and to align future strategic and investment decisions to best utilise commercial and
organisational opportunities. 

Operating cash flow as Internal Group Management focus 
20

12

124

We believe operating cash flow is the most important driver to increase
shareholder value.  Operating cash flow is comprised of operating
profit,  change in operating working capital and net investments
(capital expenditure less depreciation and amortisation)  /  
DIAGRAM 01. 
To maximise operating cash flow generation across our organisationmanagement of our operating segments together with management at
market level have responsibility for improving operating profit as well as
optimising operating working capital and capital expenditure.  To keep
senior management focused on long-term performance improvementswe have adopted a modified economic value added (EVA) model.  The
net asset base of a market or operating unit within the Group is subject
to a percentage capital charge to the operating profit of the respective
business unit.  The asset base includes operating working capital as well
as other assets needed by a market or operating unit in its day-to-day
operations.  The resulting internal KPI is called Contribution After Capital
Charge (CACC) and is used as one of the primary targets for the variable
component of managers' compensation.  This concept has been in place
Group-wide since 2010.

Operating margin as important KPI of operational
progress
Operating margin (defined as operating profit as a percentage of net
sales) is our Group's most important measure of operational success. 
It highlights the quality of our top line and operational efficiency.  The
primary drivers central to enhancing operating margin are as follows:

/ 
Sales and gross margin development: Management focuses on
identifying and exploiting opportunities that not only provide for future
growth,  but also have potential to increase gross margin (defined as
gross profit as a percentage of net sales).  Major levers for enhancing
our Group's sales and gross margin include:
/ 
Optimising our product mix
/ 
Minimising clearance activities
/ 
Increasing the quality of distribution,  with a particular focus on
controlled space
/ 
Over-proportionate growth in emerging markets such as Greater
China and Russia/CIS
/ 
Realising supply chain efficiency initiatives. 
/ 
Operating expense control: We put high emphasis on tightly
controlling operating expenses to leverage the Group's sales
growth through to the bottom line.  This requires a particular focus
on ensuring flexibility in the Group's cost base.  Marketing working
budget is our largest operating expense.  It is one of the most important
mechanisms for driving top-line growth sustainably.  Therefore,  we are
committed to improving the utilisation of our marketing expenditure. 
This includes concentrating our communication efforts (including
advertising,  public relations and digital media) on key global brand
initiatives and focusing our promotion spend on well-selected
partnerships with top events,  leagues,  clubs and athletes.

Optimisation of non-operating components
Our Group also puts a high priority on the optimisation of non-operating
components such as financial result and taxes,  as these items strongly
impact the Group's cash outflows and therefore the Group's free cash
flow.  Financial expenses are managed centrally by our Group Treasury
department  /   TREASURY,  P.  141.  The Group's current and future tax
SEE
expenditure is optimised globally by our Group Taxes department. 

Tight operating working capital management
Due to a comparatively low level of fixed assets required in our businessthe efficiency of the Group's balance sheet depends to a large degree
on our operating working capital management.  Our key metric is
operating working capital as a percentage of net sales.  Monitoring
the development of this key metric facilitates the measurement of our
progress in improving the efficiency of our business cycle.  We have
significantly enhanced operating working capital management over
recent years through improvement of our Group's inventories,  accounts
receivable and accounts payable. 
We strive to proactively manage our inventory levels to meet market
demand and ensure fast replenishment.  Inventory ageing is controlled
tightly to reduce inventory obsolescence and to optimise clearance
activities.  As a result,  stock turn development is the key performance
indicator as it measures the number of times average inventory is sold
during a year,  highlighting the efficiency of capital locked up in products. 
To minimise capital tied up in accounts receivable,  we strive to improve
collection efforts in order to reduce the Days of Sales Outstanding (DSO)
and improve the ageing of accounts receivable.  Likewise,  we strive to
optimise payment terms with our suppliers to best manage our accounts
payable. 

Improving the effectiveness of the Group's capital expenditure is
another lever to maximise our operating cash flow.  We control capital
expenditure with a top-down,  bottom-up approach.  In a first step,  Group
management defines focus areas and an overall investment budget
based on investment requests from various functions of the organisation. 
Our operating units then align their initiatives within the scope of
assigned priorities and available budget.  We evaluate potential return
on planned investments utilising the net present value method.  Risk
is accounted for,  adding a risk premium to the cost of capital and thus
reducing our estimate of future earnings streams where appropriate. 
By means of scenario planning,  the sensitivity of investment returns
is tested against changes in initial assumptions.  For large investment
projects,  timelines and deviations versus budget are monitored on a
monthly basis throughout the course of the project. 
The final step of optimising return on investments is our selective
post-mortem reviews,  where larger projects in particular are evaluated
and learnings are documented to be available for future strategic or
operational capital expenditure decisions. 

M&A activities focus on long-term value
creation potential
We see the vast majority of the Group's future growth opportunities
coming from our existing portfolio of brands.  However,  as part of our
commitment to ensuring sustainable profitable development,  we
regularly review merger and acquisition (M&A) options that may provide
additional commercial and operational opportunities.  Acquisitive growth
focus is primarily related to improving the Group's positioning within
 certain sports category,  strengthening our technology portfolio or
addressing new consumer segments. 
The strategies of any potential acquisition candidate must correspond
with the Group's strategic direction.  Maximising return on invested
capital above the cost of capital in the long term is a core consideration in
our decision-making process.  Of particular importance is evaluating the
potential impact on our Group's free cash flow.  We assess current and
future projected key financial metrics to evaluate a target's operating
profit potential.  In addition,  careful consideration is given to potential
financing needs and their impact on the Group's financial leverage.

Furthermore,  we carefully analyse the different mix effects which
impact the Group's profit ratios,  as our business performance differs
significantly across geographical markets,  business models and
channels.  The strategic implications and decisions taken in this respect
are a key element of our strategic planning efforts,  ensuring clarity and
focus of the organisation to maximise the Group's operating margin. 

Capital expenditure targeted to maximise future returns

We also aim to increase operational efficiency and reduce operating
overhead expenses as a percentage of sales.  In this respect,  we regularly
review our operational structure streamlining business processeseliminating redundancies and leveraging the scale of our organisation. 
These measures may also be supplemented by short-term initiatives
such as temporarily curtailing operational investments,  for example
staff hiring.

Cost of capital metric used to measure
investment potential 
02   /   Key financial metrics 
Creating value for our shareholders by earning a return on invested
capital above the cost of that capital is a guiding principle of our
Group strategy.  We source capital from equity and debt markets. 
Therefore,  we have a responsibility that our return on capital meets the
expectations of both equity shareholders and creditors.  We calculate
the cost of capital utilising the weighted average cost of capital (WACC)
formula.  This metric allows us to calculate the minimum required
financial returns of planned capital investments.  The cost of equity is
computed utilising the risk-free rate,  market risk premium and beta
factor.  Cost of debt is calculated using the risk-free rate,  credit spread
and average tax rate.

Gross margin 
We have developed an extensive performance measurement systemwhich utilises a variety of tools to measure the performance of the adidas
Group.  The Group's key financial metrics are monitored and compared
against budget as well as a rolling forecast on a monthly basis.  The focus
is on operating cash flow,  CACC,  net sales,  operating margin,  operating
working capital and net debt development  /  
DIAGRAM 02.  When negative
deviations exist between actual and target numbers,  we perform a
detailed analysis to identify and address the cause.  If necessary,  action
plans are implemented to optimise the development of the Group's
operating performance.  We also benchmark the Group's financial
results with those of our major competitors on a quarterly basis.  To
assess current sales and profitability development,  management
analyses sell-through information from our own-retail activities as well
as short-term replenishment orders from retailers. 
Taking into account year-to-date performance as well as opportunities
and risks,  the Group's full year financial performance is forecasted
on a quarterly basis.  In this respect,  backlogs comprising orders
received up to nine months in advance of the actual sale are also used
as an indicator.  However,  due to the growing share of own retail in our
business mix as well as fluctuating order patterns among our wholesale
partners,  our order books are less indicative of anticipated revenues
compared to the past.  Therefore,  qualitative feedback from our retail
partners on the success of our collections at the point of sale as well
as data received from our own-retail activities are becoming even more
important.  Finally,  as a further early indicator for future performancewe also conduct market research to better measure brand appeal,  brand
awareness and resulting purchase intent. 

Enhanced integrated business planning and
management approach
In order to further improve profitability and working capital efficiency
as well as operating cash flow development,  in 2011 we started the
Integrated Business Planning initiative (IBP).  This initiative focuses on
developing and forming an enhanced forecasting approach by aligning

processes and timelines of major business functions such as marketingsales and operations at a market and global level.  The centre-point of
this approach is improving the reliability of future business planningleading to a new efficiency level of order book building and conversion. 
This,  in turn,  is expected to lead to improving full-margin business. 
The whole process is set up in a rhythm and timeframe to facilitate
full cross-functional alignment and forecasting clarity in advance of
important business decision processes in particular those related
to product pricing,  range building,  material purchasing or production
capacity fixing.  To create a seamless flow between achieving our
strategic objectives and implementing operational plans,  we follow a
rolling two-year time horizon.  This ensures more focus on the mid-term
perspective,  while at the same time highlighting relevant information
around short-term business events and volatilities.  All target-setting is
fully embedded into the integrated planning process and communicated
in advance of all relevant business milestones.  The process reengineering was finalised in 2012,  and in 2013 all necessary system
changes and data restructuring will be initiated to make the approach
sustainable and integrated in all parts of our Group's value chain.

Group Business Performance
In 2012,  the adidas Group delivered a strong financial performance despite macroeconomic challenges
in many regions,  especially Western Europe.  Currency-neutral Group sales increased 6% as a result
of double-digit growth in Retail as well as in Other Businesses.  In euro terms,  adidas Group revenues
grew 12% to € 14883 billion from € 13322 billion in 2011.  The Group's gross margin increased
02 percentage points to 477% (2011: 475%),  as the positive impact from product price increases,  a
more favourable product and regional sales mix as well as a larger share of higher-margin Retail sales
more than offset the increase in input costs.  The Group's gross profit rose 12% to € 7103 billion in
2012 versus € 6329 billion in 2011.  In 2012,  the adidas Group incurred one-off expenses in an amount
of € 265 million,  which are related to the goodwill impairment for several cash-generating units of
the Group.  These one-off expenses were non-cash in nature and did not affect the adidas Group's
liquidity.  Excluding these one-off expenses,  the Group's operating profit grew 24% to € 1185 billionrepresenting an operating margin of 80%,  up 08 percentage points compared to the prior year.  Net
income attributable to shareholders excluding goodwill impairment losses was up 29% to € 791 million. 
Basic and diluted earnings per share excluding one-off expenses amounted to € 378 in 2012
(2011: € 293),  which is above our initial guidance of € 352 to € 368.

Global economy expands 23% in 2012

In 2012,  according to the World Bank,  global GDP growth moderated
to 23%,  compared to 27% in the prior year.  The emerging markets
outperformed developed economies,  growing 51% and 13%
respectively.  Stabilising inflationary pressures and increases in real
disposable incomes supported domestic consumption and economic
activity,  particularly in Asia's emerging markets.  Conversely,  many
developed markets continued to face considerable economic challengesmainly driven by sovereign debt concerns.  Despite strengthened policy
actions,  that temporarily helped lower the debt crisis impact in most of
these economies,  their low growth and the implementation of austerity
measures remained significant negative pressures to global economic
expansion. 
In Western Europe,  GDP contracted 02% (2011: increased 15%),  with
economic activity decreasing across most markets and offsetting
export-driven growth in Germany.  Notwithstanding the progress made
in stabilising the euro area's debt crisis,  the lack of visibility on the issue
during much of the year,  combined with high unemployment levels and
acute austerity measures in many markets,  inhibited investment and
depressed consumer spending and confidence. 

European emerging markets recorded positive GDP growth of around
28%,  albeit at lower levels than in recent years (2011: 48%),  with Russiathe world's largest energy exporter,  benefiting from a relatively stable
oil price,  which supported government spending and consumption. 
Nonetheless,  the contraction in the euro area negatively impacted
exports and industrial output for many of the economies in the European
emerging markets.

Positive momentum in the global sporting goods industry
In 2012,  the global sporting goods industry outperformed overall
economic development.  Growth was driven by consumer spending in
the emerging markets,  which offset subdued consumer confidence and
private spending in many Western European markets and in Japan.  Two
major sporting events,  the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games
and the UEFA EURO 2012 hosted by Poland and Ukraine,  contributed
to sporting goods sales and in particular helped support the industry
in many European markets.  From a category perspective,  basketball
posted the strongest growth rate in the industry,  with both performance
and lifestyle performing well.  Running,  which remained one of the
biggest sales drivers,  faced some softness as the year progresseddue in part to the shift in demand from lifestyle running to lifestyle
basketball.  Within the running category,  lightweight and technical
running continued to grow robustly.  The outdoor category faced some
headwinds,  primarily due to unseasonable weather,  resulting in a slight
contraction,  especially for snow-related products.  Demand remained
high for higher-priced,  innovative sporting goods products introduced
during the year with many advanced,  high-performance technologies

In Latin America,  GDP increased 27% (2011: 42%),  with low
unemployment rates,  significant government stimulus programmes
and solid domestic consumption supporting the region's economies. 
However,  moderating export demand,  particularly from Europe,  as well
as an increase in inflation negatively impacted economic expansion of
the region during the year,  making 2012 one of the lowest growth years
over the last decade.

In 2012,  most Asian economies grew strongly.  Excluding Japan,  the

growth was 44% (2011: 40%),  with China and India's GDP expanding
78% and 53%,  respectively.  Inflation stabilised or fell in most Asian
markets and,  together with robust wage growth,  helped to drive higher
levels of domestic consumption,  particularly in China.  These factors also
supported an increase in trade between the region's economies,  which
helped offset the reduced demand from most mature markets.  In Japandespite government stimulus and reconstruction investments following
the earthquake in 2011,  the economy grew only modestly,  increasing
19%,  with high energy costs,  lacklustre global demand and a diplomatic

healthy growth,  particularly in shells,  fleece and base layer clothing. 
The e-commerce channel continued to see rapid expansion across the
industry,  with a wide diversity of strategies being presented by many
players on how best to embrace omni-channel retail and leverage

In Latin America,  despite some inflationary pressures,  low unemployment and a significant increase in access to credit for many

Sales in the region also benefited from the Copa América as well as the
first activities ahead of the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

In Europe,  despite austerity measures and high unemployment in many
markets,  the sporting goods industry grew modestly in 2012.  The region
benefited directly from two of the world's major sporting events which
took place in the region.  The UK's industry,  in particular,  was buoyed
by the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.  Many European
markets benefited from the UEFA EURO 2012,  especially the title
winners Spain and the host nations Poland and Ukraine.  In European
emerging markets,  rising wages supported consumption,  which also
positively impacted the sporting goods sector,  particularly in Russia.

adidas Group revenues and profitability,  as well as that of many
competitors and retailers,  increased in 2012.  In most regions,  sales of
our Group and other major sporting goods companies grew at a higher
rate than GDP and overall consumer spending. 

The gradual recovery of the US market and a stabilisation of inflation
helped drive solid consumer spending which,  in turn,  benefited retailers
and the sporting goods industry.  Strong retail sales trends in basketballtraining and sporting lifestyle offset slight contractions in certain
running,  walking and outdoor categories.  We estimate that sporting
goods sales in the USA increased at a mid-single-digit rate in 2012driven mainly by improvements in average selling prices.  Many sporting
goods retailers focused on high-performance and innovative products
to drive sales,  in addition to increasing e-commerce activities.  Footwear
sales are estimated to have increased at a mid-single-digit rate in 2012driven in particular by growth in the basketball and training categories. 
US sporting apparel sales are also estimated to have increased at a
mid-single-digit rate in 2012.

International brands drive Asian sporting goods
industry expansion
Strong wage growth and consumer spending supported increases in
Asia's sporting goods industry,  which grew at a low- to mid-single-digit
rate in 2012.  Growth in the region's sportswear industry was mainly
driven by international brands,  with consumers attracted to them as
pseudo-luxury brands at attainable price points.  In China,  industry
growth remained robust; however,  inventory issues negatively impacted
many of the domestic players.  In Japan,  by contrast,  low consumer
spending on discretionary items kept sporting goods sales muted during
2012,  in line with overall economic trends in that market.

adidas Group currency-neutral sales grow 6%
In 2012,  Group revenues grew 6% on a currency-neutral basis,  as a result
of double-digit sales increases in Retail and Other Businesses.  This
development is in line with initial Management expectations of a mid- to

Group sales increase driven by double-digit growth
in Retail and Other Businesses
In 2012,  currency-neutral Wholesale revenues increased 2%,  as sales
growth at adidas more than offset sales declines at Reebok.  Currencyneutral Retail sales increased 14% versus the prior year,  driven by 7%
comparable store sales growth as well as new store openings in line
with the Group's retail expansion.  Revenues in Other Businesses were
up 17% on a currency-neutral basis,  mainly driven by a strong doubledigit sales increase at TaylorMade-adidas Golf.  Currency translation
effects had a positive impact on segmental sales in euro terms. 
Wholesale revenues increased 7% to € 9533 billion from € 8949 billion
in 2011.  Retail sales rose 21% to € 3373 billion versus € 2793 billion
in the prior year.  Sales in Other Businesses grew 25% to € 1977 billion
(2011: € 1580 billion).

As announced in an ad hoc release on April 30,  2012,  commercial
irregularities were discovered at Reebok India Company.  The discovery
of these irregularities resulted in the identification of material errors
in the prior period financial statements of Reebok India Company.  As a
consequence of these errors,  material misstatements are also included
in the consolidated financial statements of adidas AG for the 2011
financial year and for previous financial years,  which have to be corrected
in accordance with IAS 841 et seqq.  These corrections are reflected
in the consolidated financial statements as at December 31,  2012in which the comparative figures for the year 2011 are restated.  The
financial years prior to 2011 have not been individually restated due
to impracticality.  To the extent that earlier periods are affected,  the
misstatements have been cumulatively adjusted in the opening balance
sheet at January 1,  2011.  Details and in-depth explanations of these
restatements are outlined in the Notes in this Annual Report  /  
see
Note 03,  p.  203.  All figures in the subsequent discussion of our 2012
financial performance in the Income Statement,  Statement of Financial
Position and Statement of Cash Flows as well as other sections of
this Annual Report are based on a comparison of the 2012 figures and
the restated 2011 figures.  All financial year figures prior to 2011 are
presented as they were originally reported.

Currency-neutral sales increase in all regions
In 2012,  revenues in Western Europe increased 3% on a currencyneutral basis,  primarily as a result of double-digit sales increases in the
UK and Poland.  In European Emerging Markets,  Group sales increased
15% on a currency-neutral basis due to double-digit growth in most
of the region's markets,  in particular Russia/CIS.  Sales for the adidas
Group in North America grew 2% on a currency-neutral basis,  with sales
increases in both the USA and Canada.  Sales in Greater China increased
15% on a currency-neutral basis.  Currency-neutral revenues in Other
Asian Markets grew 7%,  driven by strong increases in Japan and South
Korea.  In Latin America,  sales grew 8% on a currency-neutral basiswith double-digit increases in most of the region's major markets,  in
particular Argentina.  Currency translation effects had a mixed impact on
regional sales in euro terms  /  
TABLE 11. 

Cost of sales increases
Cost of sales is defined as the amount we pay to third parties for expenses
associated with producing and delivering our products.  Own-production
expenses are also included in the Group's cost of sales.  However,  these
expenses represent only a very small portion of total cost of sales.  In
2012,  cost of sales was € 7780 billion,  representing an increase of 11%
compared to € 6993 billion in 2011.  This development was due to the
growth of our business as well as increases in input costs as a result of
higher raw material prices at the time of sourcing.  In addition,  higher
labour costs negatively impacted the cost of sales development.

Sales working budget consists of expenses to support the Group's
sell-through development.  Expenditures relate to advertising and
promotion initiatives at the point of sale as well as store furniture and
fixtures.  As sales working budget expenses are channel specific,  they
are allocated to the Group's operating segments.  In absolute termssales working budget expenditure decreased 10% to € 304 million in
2012 from € 338 million in the prior year.  Lower expenditure at the point
of sale as a result of increased efficiencies more than offset the negative
effect of higher expenditure due to new store openings.  By brandadidas sales working budget decreased 9% to € 220 million compared
to € 243 million in the prior year.  Sales working budget for Reebok
declined 2% to € 50 million at year-end (2011: € 51 million).  The Group's

Marketing working budget consists of items such as expenses for
promotion partnerships,  advertising and public relations.  As marketing
working budget expenses are not distribution channel specific,  they are
not allocated to the segments.  In absolute terms,  marketing working
budget increased 10% to € 1502 billion in 2012 from € 1362 billion
in the prior year.  This was mainly due to higher expenditure at the
adidas brand related to the UEFA EURO 2012 and London 2012 Olympic
Games.  In addition,  increased marketing and promotion initiatives
for new product concepts impacted this development.  By brand,  the
adidas marketing working budget increased 15% to € 1157 billion
from € 1007 billion in 2011.  Marketing working budget of the Reebok
brand was down 20% to € 188 million (2011: € 236 million).  The

DIAGRAM 22.  Depreciation and amortisation expense for
tangible and intangible assets as well as impairment losses more than
doubled to € 532 million in 2012 (2011: € 252 million).  This development
was mainly due to one-off expenses of € 265 million resulting from
goodwill impairment in 2012.  In accordance with IFRS,  intangible
assets with indefinite useful lives (goodwill and trademarks) are
tested annually and additionally when there are indications of potential
impairment.  In this connection,  impairment of intangible assets with

Goodwill impairment in an amount of € 265 million
As a result of the re-evaluation of medium-term growth prospects
of several geographic regions and segments,  the adidas Group has
impaired goodwill and recorded a € 265 million pre-tax charge as at
December 31,  2012.  The wholesale cash-generating unit North America
was impaired by € 106 million,  Latin America by € 41 million,  Brazil
by € 15 million and Iberia by € 11 million.  The impairment loss was
mainly the result of adjusted growth assumptions for the Reebok brandespecially in North America,  Latin America and Brazil,  and an increase
in the country-specific discount rates as a result of the euro crisis.  In
addition,  goodwill of € 68 million allocated to Reebok-CCM Hockey was
completely impaired and € 24 million allocated to Rockport was partially
impaired.  These impairment losses are primarily the result of the
re-evaluation of future growth prospects and,  with regard to Rockportalso due to an increase in the discount rate.  The impairment loss of
€ 265 million was non-cash in nature and does not affect the adidas
Group's liquidity  /   NOTE 02,  P.  197.

In 2012,  net cash generated from operating activities was € 942 million
(2011: € 807 million).  The increase in cash generated from operating
activities compared to the prior year was primarily due to a 21% increase
in operating profit before working capital changes.  Net cash used in
investing activities decreased to € 217 million (2011: € 566 million).  The
majority of investing activities in 2012 mainly related to spending for
property,  plant and equipment,  such as investments in the furnishing
and fitting of stores in our Retail segment,  investments in new office
buildings and in IT systems as well as the acquisition of Adams Golf. 
These were partly offset by the sale of short-term financial assets  /  
SEE
NOTE 04,  P.  209.  Net cash generated from financing activities totalled
€ 42 million (2011: net cash used of € 500 million).  Cash generated from

the issuance of a convertible bond.  This was partly offset by dividends
paid in an amount of € 209 million for the 2011 financial year as well

Capital expenditure grows 15%
Capital expenditure is the total cash expenditure for the purchase of
tangible and intangible assets (excluding acquisitions).  Group capital
expenditure increased 15% to € 434 million in 2012 (2011: € 376 million). 
The Retail segment accounted for 24% of Group capital expenditure
(2011: 26%).  Investments primarily related to the expansion of our store
base for the adidas and Reebok brands.  Expenditure in the Wholesale
segment accounted for 12% of total capital expenditure (2011: 17%). 
Capital expenditure in Other Businesses accounted for 6% of total
expenditure (2011: 7%).  The remaining 58% of Group capital expenditure
was recorded in HQ/Consolidation (2011: 50%) and was mainly related
to investments into the Group's logistics infrastructure,  new office
buildings and deployment of IT systems  /

Group financing policy
In order to be able to meet the Group's payment commitments at all
times,  the major goal of our financing policy is to ensure sufficient
liquidity reserves,  while minimising the Group's financial expenses. 
The operating activities of our Group segments and markets and the
resulting cash inflows represent the Group's main source of liquidity. 
Liquidity is planned on a rolling monthly basis under a multi-year
financial and liquidity plan.  This comprises all consolidated Group
companies.  Our in-house bank concept takes advantage of any surplus
funds of individual Group companies to cover the financial requirements
of others,  thus reducing external financing needs and optimising
our net interest expenses.  By settling intercompany transactions via
intercompany financial accounts,  we are able to reduce external bank
account transactions and thus bank charges.  Effective management of
our currency exposure and interest rate risks are additional goals and
responsibilities of our Group Treasury department. 

Treasury system and responsibilities
Our Group's Treasury Policy governs all treasury-related issuesincluding banking policy and approval of bank relationships,  financing
arrangements and liquidity/asset management,  currency and interest
risk management as well as the management of intercompany cash
flows.  Responsibilities are arranged in a three-tiered approach:
/  Treasury Committee consists of members of the Executive Board
The
and other senior executives who decide on the Group's Treasury
Policy and provide strategic guidance for managing treasury-related
topics.  Major changes to our Treasury Policy are subject to the prior
approval of the Treasury Committee. 
/ The Group Treasury department is responsible for specific centralised
treasury transactions and for the global implementation of our
Group's Treasury Policy. 
/  a subsidiary level,  where applicable and economically reasonableOn
local managing directors and financial controllers are responsible
for managing treasury matters in their respective subsidiaries. 
Controlling functions on a Group level ensure that the transactions
of the individual business units are in compliance with the Group's
Treasury Policy.

Centralised treasury function 
43   /   Total credit facilities  (€ in millions)

In accordance with our Group's Treasury Policy,  all worldwide credit lines
are directly or indirectly managed by the Group Treasury department. 
Portions of those lines are allocated to the Group's subsidiaries and
backed by adidas AG guarantees.  As a result of this centralised liquidity
management,  the Group is well positioned to allocate resources
efficiently throughout the organisation.  The Group's debt is generally
unsecured and may include standard financial covenants,  which are
reviewed on a quarterly basis.  We maintain good relations with numerous
partner banks,  thereby avoiding a high dependency on any single
financial institution.  Banking partners of the Group and our subsidiaries
are required to have at least a BBB+ long-term investment grade rating
by Standard & Poor's or an equivalent rating by another leading rating
agency.  Only in exceptional cases are Group companies authorised to
work with banks with a lower rating  /   RISK AND OPPORTUNITY REPORTSEE
P.  164.  To ensure optimal allocation of the Group's liquid financial
resources,  subsidiaries transfer excess cash to the Group's headquarters
in all instances where it is legally and economically feasible.  In additionGroup Treasury is currently rolling out a global standardisation and
consolidation of cash management and payment processes,  including
the set-up of automated,  cross-border cash pools and a payment factory. 
This implementation is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2013.

The adidas Group's financial flexibility is ensured by the availability of
unutilised credit facilities in an amount of € 2304 billion at the end of 2012
(2011: € 3898 billion).  These include a newly committed syndicated loan
facility of € 500 million as well as bilateral credit lines at different banks
in an amount of € 1804 billion (2011: € 2038 billion).  The syndicated
loan facility replaced a syndicated loan facility of € 1860 billion,  which
matured in 2012.  It has a remaining time to maturity of five years and
incorporates two one-year extension options.  The size of the syndicated
loan facility was reduced as a result of the Group's strong financial
position as well as our desire to rationalise increasingly expensive
bank credit facilities.  We monitor the ongoing need for available credit
lines based on the current level of debt as well as future financing
requirements.

In the case of our committed credit facilities,  we have entered into various
covenants.  These covenants may include limits on the disposal of fixed
assets,  the amount of debt secured by liens,  cross default provisions and
change of control.  In addition,  certain financial arrangements contain
equity ratio covenants,  minimum equity covenants as well as net loss
covenants.  If we failed to meet any covenant and were unable to obtain
 waiver from a majority of partner banks,  borrowings would become
due and payable immediately.  As at December 31,  2012,  we were in
full compliance with all of our covenants,  with ample coverage above
all stipulated minimum requirements.  As a result of our cash flow
expectations,  we are fully confident we will continue to be compliant with
these covenants going forward /   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS AND OUTLOOKSEE

by the negative effect from local borrowings in currencies which carry
 higher average interest rate.  Fixed-rate financing amounted to 96%
of the Group's total gross borrowings at the end of 2012 (2011: 77%). 
Variable-rate financing amounted to 4% of total gross borrowings at the
end of the year (2011: 23%).

As a globally operating company,  the Group is exposed to currency
risks.  Therefore,  effective currency management is a key focus of Group
Treasury,  with the aim of reducing the impact of currency fluctuations on
non-euro-denominated net future cashflows.  In this regard,  hedging US
dollars is a central part of our programme.  This is a direct result of the
Group's Asian-dominated sourcing,  which is largely denominated in US
dollars  /   GLOBAL OPERATIONS,  P.  100 In 2012,  Group Treasury managed

operational activities (2011: US $ 30 billion).  As governed by the Group's
Treasury Policy,  we have established a rolling 12- to 24-month hedging
system,  under which the vast majority of the anticipated seasonal
hedging volume is secured approximately six months prior to the start of
 season.  As a result,  we have almost completed our anticipated hedging
needs for 2013 as of year-end 2012 and have already started hedging our
exposure for 2014.  The rates for 2013 are less favourable compared to
those of 2012.  The use or combination of different hedging instrumentssuch as forward contracts,  currency options and swaps,  protects us
against unfavourable currency movements.  The use of currency options
allows the Group to benefit from future favourable exchange rate

Balance Sheet 
In 2012,  other operating income of adidas AG increased 1% to
€ 1270 billion (2011: € 1254 billion).  This was primarily due to higher
income derived from services provided to other Group companies as
well as the reversal of allowances,  which more than offset a decline in
income from currency conversion.

Financial result improves 97%
The financial result of adidas AG improved 97% to € 350 million in
2012 from € 178 million in 2011.  The strong increase is attributable to
higher profit transfers of € 336 million from affiliated companies under
profit and loss transfer agreements (2011: € 94 million).  Income from
investments in affiliated companies declined € 61 million to € 86 million
in 2012 (2011: € 147 million). 
Net interest expense of adidas AG rose 15% to € 72 million in 2012 (2011:
€ 63 million).  This development was mainly due to higher interest paid to
affiliated companies.  Interest paid to third parties decreased € 4 million
to € 36 million compared to the prior year. 

At the end of December 2012,  total assets rose 16% to € 7030 billion
versus € 6046 billion in the prior year.  This was mainly a result of an
increase in cash and cash equivalents,  which rose € 665 million.  In
addition,  receivables and other current assets increased € 209 million. 

Shareholders' equity up 15%
Shareholders' equity increased 15% to € 2672 billion at the end of
December 2012 compared to € 2322 billion in the prior year.  The
improvement was mainly due to the higher net income.  Taking into
account the dividend distribution from the prior year retained earnings
and the net income generated for the year,  the equity ratio remained
stable at 38%. 

Net income increases strongly
Income from ordinary activities rose 244% to € 581 million in 2012 from
€ 169 million in 2011.  This development is attributable to the profit from
operations and the improved financial result.  Net income for the year
after taxes of € 77 million was € 504 million (2011: € 111 million). 

Provisions increase 6%
Provisions rose 6% to € 361 million at the end of 2012 from € 339 million
in 2011.  This was mainly due to the increase in provisions for pensions
and similar commitments of € 12 million.

Cash inflow reflects net income and higher cash and
cash equivalents
adidas AG generated a positive cash flow from operating activities of
€ 665 million compared to € 157 million in the prior year.  The positive
cash flow from operating activities was mainly a result of the net income
of € 504 million generated during the period.  Net cash outflow from
investment activities was € 128 million (2011: € 132 million).  This is
largely attributable to capital expenditure for tangible and intangible
fixed assets of € 83 million.  Financing activities resulted in a positive cash
flow of € 128 million (2011: cash outflow of € 323 million).  The net cash
inflow from financing activities relates to the issuance of the convertible
bond.  This was partly offset by cash outflows for the dividend payment of
€ 209 million and the reduction in bank borrowings of € 163 million.  As a
result of all these developments,  cash and cash equivalents of adidas AG
increased € 665 million to € 1048 billion at the end of December 2012
compared to € 383 million at the end of December 2011.

Composition of subscribed capital
The nominal capital of adidas AG amounts to € 209216186 (as at
December 31,  2012) and is divided into the same number of registered
no-par-value shares with a pro-rata amount in the nominal capital of
€ 1 each ('shares").  As at December 31,  2012,  adidas AG does not hold
any treasury shares  /   NOTE 26,  P.  221.  Pursuant to § 4 section 8 of the
SEE
Articles of Association,  shareholders' claims to the issuance of individual
share certificates are,  in principle,  excluded.  Each share grants one vote
at the Annual General Meeting.  All shares carry the same rights and
obligations. 
In the USA,  we have issued American Depositary Receipts (ADRs).  ADRs
are deposit certificates of non-US shares that are traded instead of the
original shares on US stock exchanges.  Two ADRs equal one share. 

Restrictions on voting rights or transfer of shares
We are not aware of any contractual agreements with adidas AG or other
agreements restricting voting rights or the transfer of shares.  Based on
the Code of Conduct of adidas AG,  however,  particular lock-up periods
do exist for members of the Executive Board with regard to the purchase
and sale of adidas AG shares.  These lock-up periods are connected with
the publication of quarterly and full year results.  Such lock-up periods
also exist for employees who have access to yet unpublished financial
results. 
In addition,  restrictions of voting rights pursuant,  inter alia,  to § 136
German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz AktG) or for treasury
shares pursuant to § 71b AktG may exist. 

Shareholdings in share capital exceeding 10% of
voting rights
We have not been notified of,  and are not aware of,  any direct or indirect
shareholdings in the share capital of adidas AG exceeding 10% of the
voting rights. 

Shares with special rights
There are no shares bearing special rights.  In particular,  there are no
shares with rights conferring powers of control. 

Voting right control if employees have a share
in the capital
Like all other shareholders,  employees who hold adidas AG shares
exercise their control rights directly in accordance with statutory
provisions and the Articles of Association.

Executive Board appointment and dismissal
Pursuant to § 6 of the Articles of Association and § 84 AktG,  the
Supervisory Board is responsible for determining the number of
members of the Executive Board,  for their appointment and dismissal
as well as for the appointment of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). 
Currently,  the adidas AG Executive Board comprises the CEO as well
as three further members  /   EXECUTIVE BOARD,  P.  40.  Executive Board
SEE
members may be appointed for a maximum period of five years.  Such
appointments may be renewed and the terms of office may be extendedprovided that no term exceeds five years. 

20

148

The Supervisory Board may revoke the appointment of an individual
as member of the Executive Board or CEO for good cause,  such as
gross negligence of duties or a vote of no confidence by the Annual
General Meeting.  As adidas AG is subject to the regulations of the
German Co-Determination Act (Mitbestimmungsgesetz MitbestG)the appointment of Executive Board members and also their dismissal
requires a majority of at least two thirds of the Supervisory Board
members (§ 31 MitbestG).  If such a majority is not established in the first
vote by the Supervisory Board,  the Mediation Committee has to present
 proposal which,  however,  does not exclude other proposals.  The
appointment or dismissal is then made in a second vote with a simple
majority of the votes cast by the Supervisory Board members.  Should
the required majority not be established in this case either,  a third voteagain requiring a simple majority,  must be held in which,  however,  the
Chairman of the Supervisory Board has two votes. 
Furthermore,  the Fuerth,  Germany,  local court shall,  pursuant to § 85
section 1 AktG,  in urgent cases,  make the necessary appointment upon
application by any party involved,  if the Executive Board does not have
the required number of members. 

Amendments to the Articles of Association
Pursuant to § 179 section 1 sentence 1 AktG,  the Articles of Association
of adidas AG can,  in principle,  only be amended by a resolution passed
by the Annual General Meeting.  Pursuant to § 21 section 3 of the Articles
of Association in conjunction with § 179 section 2 sentence 2 AktGthe Annual General Meeting of adidas AG principally resolves upon
amendments to the Articles of Association with a simple majority of the
votes cast and with a simple majority of the nominal capital represented
when passing the resolution.  If mandatory legal provisions stipulate
 larger majority of voting rights or capital,  this is applicable.  When it
comes to amendments solely relating to the wording,  the Supervisory
Board is,  however,  authorised to make these modifications in accordance
with § 179 section 1 sentence 2 AktG in conjunction with § 10 section 1 of
the Articles of Association. 

Authorisation of the Executive Board to issue shares 
The authorisation of the Executive Board to issue shares is regulated by
§ 4 of the Articles of Association and by statutory provisions:
Authorised Capital
/ 
Until June 21,  2014,  the Executive Board is authorised to increase the
nominal capital,  subject to Supervisory Board approval,  by issuing
new shares against contributions in cash once or several times by no
more than € 50000000 altogether (Authorised Capital 2009/I). 

/ 
Until July 4,  2014,  the Executive Board is authorised to increase the
nominal capital,  subject to Supervisory Board approval,  by issuing
new shares against contributions in kind once or several times by no
more than € 25000000 altogether (Authorised Capital 2011). 
/ 
Until July 12,  2015,  the Executive Board is authorised to increase the
nominal capital,  subject to Supervisory Board approval,  by issuing
new shares against contributions in cash once or several times by no
more than € 20000000 altogether (Authorised Capital 2010). 
Subject to Supervisory Board approval,  shareholders' subscription
rights may be excluded in certain cases for each of the above-mentioned
authorisations  /   NOTE 26,  P.  221. 
SEE
Contingent Capital
/ 
Based on the resolution by the Annual General Meeting of May 62010,  the Executive Board is authorised,  subject to Supervisory Board
approval,  to issue bonds with warrants and/or convertible bonds by
the company or affiliated companies once or several times in the total
amount of up to € 15 billion,  with or without a limited term,  against
contributions in cash and to accept guarantee of such bonds issued
by affiliated companies until May 5,  2015.  Furthermore,  the Executive
Board is authorised,  subject to Supervisory Board approval,  to grant
to bondholders or bond creditors subscription or conversion rights
relating to no more than a total of 36000000 shares in compliance
with the corresponding conditions of the bonds. 
For this purpose,  the nominal capital was conditionally increased by
up to € 36000000 (Contingent Capital 2010).  The Executive Board
is authorised,  subject to Supervisory Board approval,  to exclude
shareholders' subscription rights for fractional amounts.  The
authorisation also provides for excluding shareholders' subscription
rights insofar as this is necessary for granting subscription rights
to which holders or creditors of bonds already issued before are
entitled.  Furthermore,  the Executive Board is authorised,  subject
to Supervisory Board approval,  to also exclude shareholders'
subscription rights if the issue price of the bonds is not significantly
below the market value of these bonds and the number of shares to
be issued does not exceed 10% of the nominal capital.  The issuance of
new shares or the use of treasury shares must be taken into account
when calculating the limit of 10% in certain specific cases. 

The authorisations of the Executive Board are regulated by §§ 76 et seq. 
AktG in conjunction with § 7 of the Articles of Association.  The Executive
Board is responsible,  in particular,  for managing the company and
represents the company judicially and extra-judicially.

On March 14,  2012,  following the approval of the Supervisory Boardthe Executive Board issued a convertible bond,  excluding shareholders'
subscription rights,  thus making partial use of the authorisation granted
by the Annual General Meeting on May 6,  2010.  For the issuance of
shares to bondholders,  the Contingent Capital 2010 may be utilised. 
However,  the shares will only be issued insofar as bondholders make
use of their conversion rights.  The total number of shares to be issued
to bondholders in case of full conversion currently amounts to up to
5990894 shares. 

Furthermore,  the shares may be assigned to members of the Executive
Board as compensation by way of a stock bonus subject to the provision
that resale by the Executive Board members shall only be permitted
following a retention period of at least three years from the date of
assignment.  Responsibility in this case lies with the Supervisory Board. 
In case of utilisation of shares for the above-mentioned purposes,  except
for the cancellation of shares,  shareholders' subscription rights are
excluded. 
The Supervisory Board may determine that transactions based on this
authorisation may only be carried out subject to the approval of the
Supervisory Board or one of its committees. 

The repurchase via the stock exchange will be carried out through a
public repurchase offer,  through a public invitation to submit sale offers
or through granting tender rights to shareholders.  Furthermore,  the
authorisation sets out the lowest and highest nominal value that may be
granted in each case. 

/  In the scope of the authorisation resolved by the Annual General
Meeting on May 6,  2010,  the Executive Board is furthermore authorised
to conduct the share buyback also by using equity derivatives which are
arranged with a financial institution in close conformity with market
conditions.  adidas AG may acquire call options issued for physical delivery
and/or sell put options or use a combination of call and put options
or other equity derivatives if the option conditions ensure that these
shares are only delivered if they were purchased in compliance with the
equality principle.  All share purchases using the aforementioned equity
derivatives are limited to a maximum value of 5% of the nominal capital
existing at the date on which the resolution was adopted by the Annual
General Meeting (or,  as the case may be,  a lower amount of nominal
capital at the date of utilisation of the authorisation).  The term of the
options may not exceed 18 months and must furthermore be chosen in
such a way that the shares are acquired upon the exercise of the options
no later than May 5,  2015.  The authorisation furthermore sets out the
lowest and highest nominal value that may be granted in each case. 

The purposes for which adidas AG shares repurchased based on this
authorisation may be used are set out in Item 11 of the Agenda for
the Annual General Meeting held on May 6,  2010.  The shares may in
particular be used as follows:

For excluding subscription rights as well as for the use and cancellation
of shares purchased using equity derivatives,  the general provisions
adopted by the Annual General Meeting (set out above) are applicable
accordingly. 

/  Until May 5,  2015,  the Executive Board is authorised to repurchase
adidas AG shares of up to an amount totalling 10% of the nominal capital
at the date of the resolution (or,  as the case may be,  a lower amount
of nominal capital at the date of utilisation of the authorisation) for any
lawful purpose and within the legal framework.  The authorisation may
be used by the company but also by its subsidiaries or by third parties on
account of the company or its subsidiaries or third parties assigned by
the company or one of its subsidiaries. 

/ 
They may be sold via the stock exchange,  through a public share
purchase offer made to all shareholders or sold otherwise against
cash (limited to 10% of the nominal capital taking into account certain
offsets) at a price not significantly below the stock market price of
shares with the same features. 
/ 
They may be offered and assigned as consideration for the direct or
indirect acquisition of companies,  parts of companies or participations
in companies or within the scope of company mergers. 
/ 
They may be offered and sold as consideration for the acquisition
of industrial property rights or intangible property rights or for
the acquisition of licences relating to such rights,  also through
subsidiaries. 
/ 
They may be used for purposes of meeting the subscription or
conversion rights or obligations or the company's right to delivery of
shares arising from bonds with warrants and/or convertible bonds. 
/ 
They may be cancelled without the cancellation,  or the execution
thereof,  requiring an additional resolution of the Annual General
Meeting. 

Change of control/compensation agreements
Material agreements entered into by adidas AG containing a change-ofcontrol clause relate to financing agreements.  In the case of a change
of control,  these agreements,  in accordance with common practiceentitle the creditor to termination and early calling-in of any outstanding
amounts. 
No compensation agreements exist between adidas AG and members of
the Executive Board or employees relating to the event of a takeover bid.

399% in 2011,  as a result of a more favourable brand sales mix.  By
brand,  the adidas wholesale gross margin grew 01 percentage points to
421% (2011: 420%).  The positive impacts from product price increases
as well as a more favourable product and regional mix more than offset
an increase in input costs.  The wholesale gross margin of the Reebok
brand decreased 29 percentage points to 262% versus 291% in the prior
year due to higher input costs as well as increased promotional activity.

Wholesale development by brand
In 2012,  adidas Sport Performance wholesale revenues grew 6% on a
currency-neutral basis.  Growth was mainly a result of double-digit sales
increases in the football,  running,  basketball and outdoor categories. 
Currency translation effects had a positive impact on revenues in euro
terms.  adidas Sport Performance sales grew 11% to € 6187 billion from
€ 5578 billion in the prior year. 

In 2012,  Reebok wholesale revenues decreased 28% on a currencyneutral basis.  This decline was mainly due to the discontinuation of
the NFL licence agreement,  ongoing challenges related to the brand's
existing joint venture structure in certain markets in Latin America,  as
well as the weakness in Western Europe.  In addition,  the shift of the
US-related NHL licensed apparel business into the Reebok-CCM Hockey
segment negatively contributed to the sales development in North
America.  Currency translation effects had a positive impact on revenues
in euro terms.  Reebok sales were down 25% to € 1109 billion (2011:
€ 1476 billion).

In 2012,  Retail revenues increased 14% on a currency-neutral basis
as a result of double-digit growth rates at both adidas and Reebok. 
Concept stores,  factory outlets and concession corners were all up
versus the prior year.  eCommerce grew at a strong double-digit rate. 
Currency translation effects positively impacted segmental revenues in
euro terms.  Sales grew 21% to € 3373 billion from € 2793 billion in the
prior year  /  
TABLE 08.  Currency-neutral comparable store sales rose 7%
versus the prior year,  with increases in all store formats. 
Gross margin in the Retail segment decreased 17 percentage points to
609% from 626% in 2011.  Increased promotional activities,  the rise in
input costs as well as the devaluation of the Russian rouble versus the
US dollar significantly contributed to the margin decline.  This more than
offset the positive impact from product price increases.  By brand,  the
adidas gross margin was down 15 percentage points to 621% (2011:
636%) and Reebok's gross margin decreased 27 percentage points to
551% (2011: 578%).  Retail gross profit increased 18% to € 2055 billion

Segmental operating expenses as a percentage of sales declined
19 percentage points to 395% (2011: 414%),  as a result of operating
leverage in the segment.  Segmental operating expenses in Retail
primarily relate to personnel and rent expenses as well as the sales
working budget.  Segmental operating expenses increased 15% to
€ 1331 billion from € 1156 billion in 2011.  This was a result of higher
expenditure for sales force and administration related to the expansion
of the Group's store base,  particularly in emerging markets.  In additionhigher expenses for warehousing and distribution costs also contributed
to the increase. 
Segmental operating profit increased 22% to € 724 million versus
€ 593 million in the prior year.  Segmental operating margin improved
02 percentage points to 215% (2011: 212%) /

In 2013,  despite a high degree of economic uncertainty,  we expect the global economy and consumer
spending to increase,  providing a positive backdrop for the continued growth and expansion of the
sporting goods industry.  Through an extensive pipeline of new and innovative products at all brandstight control of inventories throughout 2012,  and a more benign input cost environment,  we project
top- and bottom-line improvements in our Group's financial results in 2013.  We forecast adidas Group
sales to increase at a mid-single-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis,  with growth expected in all
segments.  Group gross margin is forecasted to increase to a level between 480% and 485%,  primarily
as a result of positive regional and channel mix effects,  as well as improvements in the Retail segment
and at the Reebok brand.  Group operating margin is forecasted to increase to a level approaching 90%driven by the increase in gross margin as well as lower other operating expenses as a percentage of
sales.  As a result,  we project earnings per share to grow to a level between € 425 and € 440.

In Western Europe,  GDP is projected to remain almost unchangedincreasing by around 01% in 2013,  with the euro area contracting by
02%.  Deleveraging,  tight credit levels,  austerity measures and rising
unemployment remain as major headwinds to the region's economic
recovery.  Nevertheless,  stabilising demand from Asia is expected to
support export activity,  particularly for Germany,  the region's largest
economy,  where domestic demand and GDP are forecasted to remain
positive.  Despite lower demand for exports to the euro area,  European
emerging markets are estimated to grow at around 27% in 2013,  with
major economies such as Russia,  Turkey and Poland,  in particularexpected to benefit from robust domestic consumption.

Since the end of 2012,  there have been no significant organisationmanagement,  economic,  socio-political,  legal or financial changes
which we expect to influence our business materially going forward. 

While policy actions have lowered the effects from the sovereign debt
crisis in the euro area and the USA,  the development of the global
economy remains subject to a high degree of uncertainty in 2013. 
According to the World Bank,  global GDP is projected to increase 24%
in 2013 (2012: 23%).  Developed markets are expected to expand by
just 13%,  with the euro area likely to remain in recession and Japan's
economic growth expected to be modest.  Conversely,  the majority of the
world's economic growth will continue to be derived from the emerging
markets,  which are forecasted to grow by 55%.  Furthermore,  in many
of these developing economies,  this growth is projected to continue to
support rapid wage increases and disposable income.  These positive
economic growth expectations and the outlook for consumer spendingparticularly in the emerging markets,  are forecasted to be supportive of
our growth aspirations in 2013.

In the USA,  GDP is forecasted to grow 27% in 2013,  driven by domestic
consumption as well as increasing industrial and export activities. 
The consensus is that inflation will remain moderate,  while the labour
and housing markets will continue to improve.  These effects should
support more robust spending and economic expansion,  with the pace
of recovery accelerating in the second half of the year.  Neverthelesscontinued concerns over the sovereign debt crisis in the euro area as
well as headwinds from higher taxes and spending cuts,  together with
 relatively high unemployment rate,  will impede a more rapid overall
recovery. 
In Asia,  GDP is projected to increase 42% in 2013.  With the exception of
Japan,  growth is expected to remain robust,  driven by strong industrial
activity and domestic demand.  China remains the region's growth
engine and is forecasted to expand by 86%.  In most of the region's
emerging markets,  leading economic indicators point to inflation
remaining contained and wage growth continuing to expand,  which is
expected to support consumer spending.  However,  in Japan,  despite the
government's substantial fiscal and monetary policies and an expected
recovery in export levels,  GDP is predicted to increase a modest 02%
in 2013.  Negative pressures such as low domestic consumption,  a high
debt burden and power supply restraints are expected to keep the pace
of growth lacklustre.

In Latin America,  GDP growth rates are set to increase 31% in 2013with a recovery in exports,  a healthy labour market and relatively
robust consumer spending all forecasted to support economic activity. 
However,  further policy intervention as the region's governments seek
to balance growth against significant inflationary pressures may impact
this development. 

Sporting goods industry expansion to continue in 2013
In the absence of any major economic shocks,  we expect the global
sporting goods industry to grow in 2013,  however with significant
regional variation.  Following macroeconomic trends,  consumer
spending on sporting goods in the emerging economies is expected to
grow faster than in the more developed markets.  Inflationary pressuresparticularly in relation to commodity prices,  are projected to remain
relatively contained in most markets.  However,  wage growth in the
faster-growing economies will continue to add significant costs to the
industry,  especially where the industry sources and manufactures
sporting goods. 
Private consumption in many mature markets is forecasted to remain
challenging in 2013,  limiting industry expansion in those markets. 
Conversely,  the sporting goods sector is expected to maintain robust
growth in the emerging economies,  especially in Asia.  Additionally,  in
2013,  the industry should gain momentum in the second half of the yearespecially in the football category,  due to the 2013 FIFA Confederations
Cup and the build-up to the 2014 FIFA World Cup,  which are both being
hosted by Brazil. 
In much of Europe,  the sporting goods industry is expected to face
difficult headwinds in 2013.  Sporting goods retail activity is forecasted to
be negatively affected by rising unemployment levels,  stringent austerity
measures,  low wage growth and reduced consumer spending.  Moreoverlapping the London 2012 Olympic Games (UK) and the UEFA EURO 2012
(Poland and Ukraine),  which added to the industry's performance in
the region in 2012,  will accentuate the contraction,  particularly in the
host markets.  However,  robust consumer spending in Germany and
some European emerging markets,  such as Russia and Turkey,  should
continue.  Russia's sporting goods sector,  in particular,  will benefit from
the 14th IAAF World Championships in Athletics,  which are being hosted
in Moscow in August.

In other Asian markets,  the sporting goods industry is forecasted to
record strong growth in 2013,  however with regional differences.  Japan's
sporting goods industry is expected to be challenging in 2013,  given
that overall consumer confidence and spending are projected to remain
low.  Most of the other major Asian emerging markets are expected to
see rapid sporting goods sales growth in 2013,  as domestic demand
increases and rising wages continue to drive purchases of discretionary
items. 
The sporting goods industry in Latin America is projected to record
robust growth in 2013,  with a healthy labour market and wage growthas well as increasing access to credit,  expected to promote consumer
spending and discretionary purchases.  Furthermore,  given the
importance of football in this region,  the industry is expected to gain
significant momentum from the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup and the
build-up to the 2014 FIFA World Cup. 

We expect adidas Group sales to increase at a mid-single-digit rate on
 currency-neutral basis in 2013.  Currency translation is expected to
negatively impact our top-line development in reported terms.  Despite
 high degree of uncertainty regarding the global economic outlook
and consumer spending,  Group sales development will be favourably
impacted by our high exposure to fast-growing emerging markets
as well as the further expansion of Retail.  In addition,  our strength in
innovation will lead to major product launches throughout 2013,  which
will more than offset the non-recurrence of sales related to the UEFA
EURO 2012 and the London 2012 Olympic Games.  In terms of phasingsales growth is projected to be weighted towards the second half of the
year.  Given these expectations for the year,  we expect the adidas Group
to outperform global economic growth in 2013. 

Currency-neutral Wholesale revenues expected to
increase at a low-single-digit rate
We project currency-neutral Wholesale segment revenues to increase
at a low-single-digit rate compared to the prior year.  Our growth
expectations are supported by order backlog development as well as
positive retailer and trade show feedback.  Currency-neutral adidas
Sport Performance sales are forecasted to increase at a low-singledigit rate,  driven by growth in key categories such as running,  training
and basketball.  adidas Sport Style revenues are projected to increase
at a high-single-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis,  as a result of
continued momentum and expansion of adidas Originals and the adidas
NEO label.  Currency-neutral Reebok sales are expected to increase at
 mid-single-digit rate,  mainly due to growth in fitness training,  fitness
running and Classics as well as the introduction of new categories such
as Studio.

In Greater China,  strong wage growth and domestic consumption
should propel sporting goods sales in 2013.  The trend and market share
shift towards international brands is expected to continue.  Howeveroversupply and discounting are concerns for the industry,  particularly
for local players.

In the USA,  industry growth rates are expected to be ahead of the
economy's overall growth,  with lower fuel prices and a recovery
in property values supporting consumer sentiment and spending
expectations.  From a category perspective,  the trend towards basketball
styles is set to continue.  Training and high-performance technical
footwear and apparel are also predicted to be significant sporting goods
drivers for the year.  The US golf market is also expected to see modest
growth in 2013.

Retail sales to increase at a high-single- to low-doubledigit rate on a currency-neutral basis 
adidas Group sales expected to increase in all
geographical areas 
adidas Group currency-neutral Retail segment sales are projected to
grow at a high-single- to low-double-digit rate in 2013.  Expansion of the
Group's own-retail store base and comparable store sales are expected
to contribute at a similar rate to revenue growth.  The Group expects a
net increase of its store base by around 100 adidas and Reebok stores
in 2013.  We plan to open around 250 new stores,  depending on the
availability of desired locations.  New stores will primarily be located in
emerging markets in Eastern Europe.  Approximately 150 stores will be
closed over the course of the year.  Around 150 stores will be remodelled. 
Comparable store sales are expected to increase at a low- to mid-singledigit rate compared to the prior year.  As a result of the improvements in
concept store operations,  we project concept store growth rates to be
slightly better than those of factory outlets. 

We expect Group currency-neutral revenues to increase in all of our
geographical areas in 2013,  however at varying growth rates.  In Western
Europe,  despite the non-recurrence of the UEFA EURO 2012 as well as
the London 2012 Olympic Games,  which provided a positive stimulus
in the region in 2012,  a gradual improvement in the macroeconomic
environment as well as the build-up to the 2014 FIFA World Cup in the
second half of the year will positively impact sales development in this
region,  albeit at a very modest level.  In European Emerging Markets,  the
expansion of and increasing sophistication in our own-retail activitiesparticularly in Russia/CIS,  are forecasted to have a positive influence
on Group sales.  In North America,  we expect solid growth due to
continued momentum of the adidas brand as we further strengthen our
product offering and distribution scope as well as introduce consumer
engagement initiatives.  Reebok sales are also projected to return to
growth,  driven by new product introductions.  In Greater China,  we
expect further growth in line with our Route 2015 aspirations.  This
development will be primarily driven by expanding and solidifying our
distribution footprint,  including the further roll-out of adidas Originals
and the adidas NEO label.  In Other Asian Markets,  growth will be driven
by markets such as South Korea and Southeast Asia as well as the
non-recurrence of clean-up activities at Reebok India Company.  Lastlyin Latin America,  despite trade barriers which will continue to weigh
on growth prospects and the timing of sales in certain markets,  Group
sales development is projected to be positively impacted by the solid
momentum of the region's sporting goods industry.  Furthermore,  the
2013 FIFA Confederations Cup as well as preparations for the 2014 FIFA
World Cup will be a positive stimulus to the region. 

Currency-neutral sales of Other Businesses to grow at
a mid- to high-single-digit rate 
20

12

160

In 2013,  revenues of Other Businesses are expected to increase at a midto high-single-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis.  TaylorMade-adidas
Golf currency-neutral sales are projected to grow at a mid-single-digit
rate compared to the prior year.  Product launches in core categories such
as metalwoods and irons,  new product introductions in footwear and the
first full year of consolidation of Adams Golf should support growth in
this segment.  Currency-neutral revenues at Rockport are forecasted
to increase at a mid- to high-single-digit rate driven by a broadening
of the product assortment,  particularly in lightweight and women's,  as
well as own-retail expansion.  Currency-neutral sales at Reebok-CCM
Hockey are expected to grow at a low-double-digit rate,  supported by
new product introductions in its key categories skates and sticks,  as well
as the non-recurrence of negative impacts related to the prolonged NHL
lockout affecting the 2012/2013 season. 

Group gross margin to improve in 2013
In 2013,  the adidas Group gross margin is forecasted to increase to
 level between 480% and 485% (2012: 477%).  Improvements are
expected in all segments.  Group gross margin will benefit from positive
regional and channel mix effects,  as growth rates in high-margin
emerging markets and Retail are projected to be above growth rates in
more mature markets and Wholesale.  In addition,  improvements in the
Retail segment as well as at the Reebok brand will positively influence
Group gross margin development.  However,  these positive effects will
be partly offset by less favourable hedging terms compared to the prior
year as well as increasing labour costs,  which are expected to negatively
impact our cost of sales.

Group other operating expenses to decrease modestly
as a percentage of sales 
Average operating working capital as a percentage
of sales to increase moderately 
In 2013,  the Group's other operating expenses as a percentage of sales
are expected to decrease modestly (2012: 413%).  Sales and marketing
working budget expenses as a percentage of sales are projected to be
at a similar level compared to the prior year.  Marketing investments to
support new product launches at all brands,  as well as the expansion
of Reebok's activities in the fitness category,  will be offset by the
non-recurrence of expenses in relation to the UEFA EURO 2012 as well
as the London 2012 Olympic Games.  Operating overhead expenditure as
a percentage of sales is forecasted to decline modestly in 2013.  Higher
administrative and personnel expenses in the Retail segment due to the
planned expansion of the Group's store base will be offset by leverage in
the Group's non-allocated central costs. 

In 2013,  average operating working capital as a percentage of sales is
expected to increase moderately compared to the prior year level (2012:
200%).  This is mainly due to working capital increases to support the
growth of our business as well as the build-up to the 2014 FIFA World
Cup. 

Operating margin to continue to expand
In 2013,  we expect the operating margin for the adidas Group to increase
to a level approaching 90% (2012 excluding goodwill impairment losses:
80%).  Improvements in the Group's gross margin as well as lower other
operating expenses as a percentage of sales are expected to be the
primary drivers of the improvement. 

Earnings per share to increase to a level between
€ 425 and € 440
Basic and diluted earnings per share are expected to increase at
 rate of 12% to 16% to a level between € 425 and € 440 compared
to the 2012 basic and diluted earnings per share of € 378 excluding
goodwill impairment losses.  This represents net income attributable to
shareholders of € 890 million to € 920 million.  Top-line improvement and
an increased operating margin will be the primary drivers of this positive
development.  In addition,  we expect lower interest rate expenses in
2013 as a result of a lower average level of gross borrowings.  The Group
tax rate is expected to be at a level between 280% and 285% and thus
more favourable compared to the prior year tax rate of 293% excluding
goodwill impairment losses. 

In 2013,  capital expenditure is expected to amount to € 500 million to
€ 550 million (2012: € 434 million).  Investments will focus on adidas
and Reebok controlled space initiatives,  in particular in emerging
markets.  These investments will account for around 35% of total
investments in 2013.  Other areas of investment include the Group's
logistics infrastructure,  the further development of the adidas Group
headquarters in Herzogenaurach,  Germany,  and the increased
deployment of SAP and other IT systems in major subsidiaries within
the Group.  Projected capital expenditure by segment is outlined in the
diagram below  /  
Diagram 02.  All investments within the adidas Group
in 2013 are expected to be fully financed through cash generated from
operating activities. 

Excess cash to be used to support growth initiatives
In 2013,  we expect continued positive cash flow from operating activities. 
Cash will be used to finance working capital needs,  investment activitiesas well as dividend payments.  We intend to largely use excess cash to
invest in our Route 2015 growth initiatives and to further reduce gross
borrowings.  In 2013,  gross borrowings of € 280 million will mature.  In
order to ensure long-term flexibility,  we aim to maintain a ratio of net
borrowings over EBITDA of less than two times as measured at year-end
(2012: –03).

Efficient liquidity management in place for 2013

adidas Group expects further growth and margin
improvements in 2014 and 2015

Efficient liquidity management remains a priority for the adidas Group
in 2013.  We focus on continuously anticipating the operating cash flows
of our Group segments,  as this represents the main source of liquidity
within the Group.  On a quarterly basis,  liquidity is forecasted on a
multi-year financial and liquidity plan.  Long-term liquidity is ensured by
continued positive operating cash flows and sufficient unused committed
and uncommitted credit facilities.  In 2013,  we do not expect any major
financing activities in order to replace maturing credit facilities  /

In light of the strong cash flow generation in 2012 and resulting improved
net cash position at year-end,  Management will recommend paying a
dividend of € 135 to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting (AGM)
on May 8,  2013,  representing an increase of 35% compared to the prior
year (2011: € 100).  Subject to shareholder approval,  the dividend will be
paid on May 9,  2013.  The proposal represents a payout ratio of 357% of
net income attributable to shareholders excluding goodwill impairment
losses,  compared to 341% in the prior year.  This complies with our
dividend policy,  according to which we intend to pay out between 20%
and 40% of net income attributable to shareholders annually.  Based on
the number of shares outstanding at the end of 2012,  the dividend payout
will thus increase to € 282 million compared to € 209 million in the prior
year. 

Management assessment of financial outlook
Since the adidas Group publicly announced its Route 2015 strategic
business plan in 2010,  we have made significant progress towards our
Route 2015 aspirations.  Given the strong performance over the last two
years,  we are confident that we will reach our strategic goals.  We will
remain focused on creating long-term sustainable shareholder value
and continue to pursue all targets with utmost diligence.  In 2013,  we
will see a specific emphasis on driving improvements in our operating
margin as well as creating a platform for growth in the upcoming 2014
event year.  The outlook we are presenting for 2013 underpins the validity
of our Route 2015 plan and aspirations.

Risk and Opportunity Report
The adidas Group continuously explores and develops opportunities to sustain earnings and drive
long-term increases in shareholder value.  We acknowledge that in our daily business we are exposed
to various risks and that it is necessary to take certain risks to maximise business opportunities. 
Our risk and opportunity management principles and system provide the framework for our Group to
conduct business in a well-controlled environment. 

Risk and opportunity management principles 
01   /   adidas Group risk and opportunity management system 

The adidas Group is regularly confronted with risks and opportunities
which have the potential to negatively or positively impact the assetsliabilities,  financial position and profit and loss of the Group,  or intangible
assets such as brand image. 

Supervisory and Executive Boards 
We define risk as the potential occurrence of an external or internal
event (or series of events) that may negatively impact our ability to
achieve the Group's business objectives or financial goals.  Opportunity
is defined as the potential occurrence of an external or internal event
(or series of events) that can positively impact the Group's business
objectives or financial goals.

Group Risk Management 
Risk Management Policy & Methodology/Support 
Monitoring &
Reporting 
In this Risk and Opportunity Report,  we have outlined the Group's most
important risks and opportunities as well as other risks that have a
particular relevance from an industry or financial market perspective.  We
have summarised risks in four main categories: Strategic,  OperationalLegal & Compliance and Financial.  Opportunities are classified in two
main categories: Strategic & Operational and Financial. 

Handling 
Risk Owners 
Identification 
Evaluation 
Risk and opportunity management system
The adidas AG Executive Board has the overall responsibility to operate
an effective risk and opportunity management system that ensures
comprehensive and consistent management of all significant risks and
opportunities.  The Group Risk Management department coordinates
the execution and further development of the adidas Group's risk and
opportunity management system and is the owner of the centrally
managed risk and opportunity management process on behalf of
the adidas AG Executive Board.  The adidas AG Supervisory Board
has the responsibility to monitor the effectiveness of the Group's risk
management system.  These duties are undertaken by the Supervisory
Board's Audit Committee.  In addition,  the Global Internal Audit
department also includes an assessment of compliance with the Group
Risk Management Policy as part of its regular auditing activities of
selected adidas Group subsidiaries or functions each year. 

We believe that a key component of optimal risk and opportunity
management is the identification and evaluation of risks,  risk-mitigating
actions and opportunities where they arise.  In addition,  a concerted
approach to handling,  monitoring and reporting is of key importance. 
Therefore,  risk and opportunity management is a Group-wide activitywhich utilises critical day-to-day management insight from both global
and local business units and functions. 

To facilitate effective risk and opportunity management,  we implemented
an integrated risk and opportunity management system,  which focuses
on the identification,  evaluation,  handling,  monitoring and reporting of
risks and opportunities.  The key objective of this system is to protect
and further grow shareholder value through an opportunity-focused,  but
risk-aware decision-making framework.

The Risk Owners use various instruments in the risk and opportunity
identification process,  such as primary qualitative and quantitative
research including trend scouting,  consumer surveys as well as feedback
from our business partners and controlled space network.  These efforts
are supported by global market research and competitor analysis. 
Through this process,  we seek to identify the markets,  categoriesconsumer target groups and product styles which show most potential
for future growth at a local and global level.  Equally,  our analysis focuses
on those areas that are at risk of saturation,  or exposed to increased
competition or changing consumer tastes. 

/  Risk and opportunity evaluation: In order to manage risks and
opportunities in an effective way,  we evaluate identified risks and
opportunities individually according to a systematic evaluation
methodology,  which is applied consistently and allows adequate
prioritisation as well as allocation of resources.  Risk and opportunity
evaluation is also part of the Risk Owners' responsibility.  The Group Risk
Management department supports and guides the Risk Owners in the
evaluation process.  According to our risk and opportunity management
methodology,  risks and opportunities are evaluated by looking at two
dimensions the potential (financial) impact and the likelihood that
this impact materialises,  both considering the upcoming twelve-month
period.  This does not mean that the respective Risk Owners are only
looking at risks from a short-term perspective.  Their assessment also
includes a mid-term (12 to 24 months) and long-term (beyond 24 months)
perspective.  The potential impact is evaluated by utilising five categories:
marginal,  minor,  moderate,  significant and major.  These categories
represent quantitative or equivalent qualitative measurements.  The
quantitative measurements are based on the potential financial effect on
the relevant income statement metrics (operating profit,  financial result 
When assessing risks,  we consider two perspectives the gross risk
and the net risk.  While the gross risk reflects the worst-case negative
(financial) impact before any mitigating actions,  the net risk reflects
the expected remaining (financial) impact after all mitigating actions. 
On the one hand,  this approach allows for a good understanding of the
impact of mitigating action taken,  and on the other hand provides the
basis for scenario analysis and simulations.  We regularly measure the
actual financial impact of risks that materialised against the original
assessment.  In that way,  we ensure continuous monitoring of the
accuracy of risk evaluations across the Group,  which enables us to
continuously improve evaluation methodology based on our findings. 
In assessing the potential effect from opportunities,  each opportunity
is appraised with respect to viability,  commerciality and potential risks. 
This approach is applied to longer-term strategic prospects but also
to shorter-term tactical and opportunistic initiatives at both the Group
and,  more extensively,  the market and brand level.  In contrast to the
risk evaluation,  we do not distinguish between gross and net perspective
when assessing opportunities. 

/  Risk and opportunity handling: Risks and opportunities are treated
in accordance with the Group's risk and opportunity management
principles as described in the Group Risk Management Policy.  Risk
Owners are in charge of developing and implementing appropriate
risk-mitigating actions and exploiting opportunities within their area
of responsibility.  In addition,  the Risk Owners need to determine a
general risk handling strategy for the identified risks,  which is either
risk avoidance,  risk reduction with the objective to minimise (financial)
impact and/or likelihood of occurrence,  risk transfer to a third party or
risk acceptance.  The decision on the implementation of the respective
risk handling strategy also takes into account the costs in relation to the
effectiveness of any planned mitigating actions if applicable.  The Group
Risk Management department works closely with the Risk Owners to
monitor the continuous progress of planned mitigating actions and
assess the viability of already implemented mitigating actions.

/  Risk and opportunity identification: The adidas Group continuously
monitors the macroeconomic environment,  developments in the
sporting goods industry,  as well as internal processes,  to identify risks
and opportunities as early as possible.  The Risk Owners (i, e.  all direct
reports to the adidas AG Executive Board and the managing directors of
all our markets) have primary responsibility for the identification of risks
and opportunities.  The Group Risk Management department has defined
 catalogue of potential risk areas (Risk Universe) to assist Risk Owners
in identifying and categorising risks and opportunities.  Our Group-wide
network of Risk Owners ensures an effective identification of risks
and opportunities.  While various Risk Owners according to their
area of responsibility actively monitor the overall macroeconomicpolitical,  social and regulatory landscape,  others closely observe branddistribution channel and price point developments as well as changes
in other areas such as input prices,  financial market conditions or
technological developments. 

or tax expenses).  Qualitative measurements used are,  for example,  the
degree of media exposure or additional senior management attention
needed.  Likelihood represents the possibility that a given risk or
opportunity may materialise with the specific impact.  The likelihood of
individual risks and opportunities is evaluated on a percentage scale
divided into five categories: unlikely,  possible,  likely,  probable and highly
probable.

Our risk and opportunity management process contains the following
components:

/  Risk and opportunity monitoring and reporting: Our integrated risk
and opportunity management system aims to increase the transparency
of Group risks and opportunities.  As both risks and opportunities are
subject to constant change,  Risk Owners not only monitor developmentsbut also the adequacy and effectiveness of the current risk handling
strategy on an ongoing basis. 
Regular risk reporting consists of a two-step reporting stream
supported and facilitated by a globally used Group-wide IT solution that
was implemented in 2011.  Firstly,  on a quarterly basis,  Risk Owners are
required to report to Group Risk Management risks with a possible gross
impact rating of at least moderate (financial equivalent: impact on the
relevant income statement metric above the threshold of € 10 million)
and a net impact rating of at least minor (financial equivalent: impact on
the relevant income statement metric above the threshold of € 1 million)both regardless of the likelihood of materialising.  Opportunities are
aggregated separately,  with Risk Owners reporting all opportunities with
an impact rating of at least minor (financial equivalent: above € 1 million
impact on the relevant income statement metric).  Secondly,  Group Risk
Management aggregates the reported risks and,  also on a quarterly
basis,  provides the adidas AG Executive Board with a consolidated
Group-wide report based on the Risk Owners' input.

Material changes in previously reported risks and/or newly identified
risks with a potential net impact of moderate (financial equivalent:
impact on the relevant income statement metric above the threshold of
€ 10 million),  and any issues identified which due to their material nature
require immediate reporting to the Executive Board,  are also reported
outside the regular quarterly reporting stream on an ad hoc basis. 

Description of the main features of the internal
control and risk management system relating to the
consolidated financial reporting process pursuant
to § 315 section 2 no.  5 German Commercial Code
(Handelsgesetzbuch HGB)
We regard the internal control and risk management system relating
to the consolidated financial reporting process of the adidas Group
as a process which is embedded within the Group-wide corporate
governance system.  The internal control and risk management system
relating to the consolidated financial reporting process aims at avoiding
false representation in our Group accounting and in external financial
reporting by ensuring Group-wide compliance with statutory provisions
and internal Group regulations.  We regard the internal control and risk
management system as a process based on the principle of segregation
of duties,  encompassing various sub-processes in the areas of
Accounting,  Controlling,  Taxes,  Treasury,  Planning,  Reporting and Legalfocusing on the identification,  assessment,  treatment,  monitoring and
reporting of financial reporting risks.  Clearly defined responsibilities are 
assigned to each distinct sub-process in the various areas.  In a first stepthe internal control and risk management system serves to identify and
assess as well as to limit and control risks identified in the consolidated
financial reporting process which might result in our consolidated
financial statements not being in conformity with regulations. 
The internal control system relating to the consolidated financial
reporting process serves to provide reasonable assurance that the
financial statements are prepared in compliance with regulations
despite identified financial reporting risks.  To monitor the effectiveness
of the internal control and risk management system,  Internal Audit and
our central Group Policies and Internal Controls department regularly
review accounting-relevant processes.  Additionally,  as part of the
year-end audit,  the external auditor selects and examines internal
controls,  including the IT systems,  to assess their effectiveness.  The
Supervisory Board's Audit Committee also monitors the effectiveness
of the internal control system.  Even with appropriate and functional
systems,  however,  absolute certainty about the effectiveness of the
internal control system cannot be guaranteed. 
adidas AG defines uniform consolidated financial reporting policies and
updates these on a regular basis,  dependent on regulatory changes and
internal developments.  Clear policies serve to limit employees' scope
of discretion with regard to recognition and valuation of assets and
liabilities,  thus reducing the risk of inconsistent accounting practices
within the Group.  These policies are available to all employees involved
in the financial reporting process through the Group-wide intranet. 
Material changes are communicated to the subsidiaries Group-wide on
 quarterly basis.  We aim to ensure compliance with the consolidated
financial reporting policies through continuous adherence to the
four-eyes principle in accounting-related processes.  Certain reporting
obligations and the extent thereof are mandatory for the Group's
subsidiaries.  Adherence to reporting obligations and timelines is
monitored centrally by Group Accounting. 
The accounting at subsidiaries is conducted either locally by the
respective company or by an adidas Group Shared Service Centre,  in
accordance with our global consolidated financial reporting policies. 
Most of the IT systems used are based on a Group-wide standardised
SAP system.  Some Group companies use Navision-based ERP software. 
Following approval by the Finance Director of the subsidiary,  the local
financial statements are transferred into a central consolidation system
based on SAP SEM-BCS.  The regularity and reliability of the financial
statements prepared by subsidiaries and adjusted to the Group's uniform
accounting policies are reviewed at Group level by Group Accounting and
Controlling.  These measures include automated validation in the system
as well as creation of reports and analyses to ensure data integrity and
adherence to reporting logic.  In addition,  differences between actual
financial data and prior year as well as budget figures are analysed on
 distribution channel and market level.  If necessary,  the Group seeks
the opinion of independent experts to review business transactions

/

that occur infrequently and not on a routine basis.  After ensuring data
plausibility,  the centrally coordinated and monitored consolidation
process begins,  running automatically on SAP SEM-BCS.  Controls
within the individual consolidation steps,  such as those relating to the
consolidation of debt or of income and expenses,  are conducted both
system-based,  using automatically created consolidation logs,  and
manually.  Any inadequacies are remedied manually by systematically
processing the individual errors and differences and are reported back
to the subsidiaries.  After finalisation of all consolidation steps,  all
items in the P&L and statement of financial position are analysed with
respect to trends and variances.  Unless already otherwise clarified,  the
subsidiaries are asked to explain any identified material deviations.

In 2012,  we further sharpened the Group Risk Management Policywhich is available to all Group employees on our intranet.  The policy
outlines the principles,  processes,  tools,  risk areas,  key responsibilitiesreporting requirements and communication timelines within our Group. 
In particular,  we simplified the reporting thresholds,  which are now based
only on potential impact independent of the likelihood of materialising
(previously a multiplication of both).  We also updated and adjusted our
Risk Universe.  During the year,  the Group Risk Management department
held numerous training sessions and workshops,  to further increase risk
awareness and establish a culture of risk-conscious decision-making. 
Furthermore,  we modified our risk aggregation methodology,  putting
particular emphasis on the evaluation of the potential impact.  This also
contributed to visible changes in various risk ratings compared to the
prior year.  In addition,  we also strengthened and institutionalised our
Group's compliance and internal control structures and activities.  From
an organisational perspective,  we have closely linked our compliance
management system with Group Risk Management.  We have established
 global network of local Compliance Officers,  to whom complaints
and indications of possible compliance issues can be reported.  These
Compliance Officers report directly to the Group's Chief Compliance
Officer.  Moreover,  we have set up a central Group Policies and Internal
Controls department.

All financial systems used are protected against malpractice by means
of appropriate authorisation concepts,  approval concepts and access
restrictions.  Access authorisations are reviewed on a regular basis
and updated if required.  The risk of data loss or outage of accountingrelated IT systems is minimised by Group IT through central control
and monitoring of virtually all IT systems,  centralised management of
change processes and through regular data backups.

Strategic risks 
Risks related to distribution strategy 
Macroeconomic,  socio-political and regulatory risks
Growth in the sporting goods industry is highly dependent on consumer
spending and consumer confidence.  Economic downturns,  sociopolitical factors such as civil unrest,  nationalisation or expropriation,  in
particular in regions where the Group is highly represented,  therefore
pose a significant risk to sales development.  In addition,  significant
changes in the regulatory environment (e.g.  trade policies,  tax legislationproduct quality and safety standards,  etc. ) could lead to potential cost
increases.  To mitigate these macroeconomic,  socio-political and
regulatory risks,  the Group strives to balance sales across key global
regions and also between developed and emerging markets.  We also
continuously monitor the macroeconomic,  political and regulatory
landscape in all our key markets to anticipate potential problem areasso that we are able to quickly adjust our business activities accordingly
upon any change in conditions.  Furthermore,  a core element of our
positioning in performance sports is the utilisation of an extensive global
event and partnership portfolio where demand is more predictable and
less sensitive to macroeconomic influences.  In addition,  building on our
leading position within the sporting goods industry,  we actively engage
in supporting policymakers and regulators to liberalise global tradecurtail trade barriers and pro-actively adapt to significant changes in the
regulatory environment. 

20

168

In 2013,  we expect the global economy to grow,  albeit with varying
/  
degrees of performance geographically  SEE SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
AND OUTLOOK,  P.  157.  However,  as a result of the highly challenging
macroeconomic environment in many European countries,  Japan and
the USA as well as the political and regulatory uncertainty in the Middle
East and several Latin American countries,  we still regard the potential
impact of macroeconomic,  socio-political and regulatory factors as
major.  Likewise,  we continue to assess the likelihood that adverse
macroeconomic,  socio-political or regulatory events could impact our
business to that extent as likely. 

The inability to appropriately influence in which channels the Group's
products are sold constitutes a continuous risk.  Grey market activityparallel imports or the distribution of our products on open online
marketplaces could negatively affect our own sales performance and the
image of our Group brands.  Furthermore,  weakly defined segmentation
and channel strategies could lead to an unhealthy utilisation of our
multiple distribution channels as well as strong retaliation from our
customers.  As a result,  the Group has developed and implemented clearly
defined distribution policies and procedures  /   GLOBAL SALES STRATEGYSEE
P.  72 to avoid over-distribution of products in a particular channel and
limit the exposure to unwanted channels such as grey markets or open
marketplaces.  In addition,  we conduct specific trainings for our sales
force to appropriately manage product distribution and ensure that the
right product is sold at the right point of sale to the right consumer at
an adequate price. 
Nevertheless,  unbalanced product distribution and the inability to
effectively manage our different sales channels could have a significant
impact on the Group.  As a result of the dynamic market environment
and the fast-changing world of online sales,  we evaluate the likelihood
of materialising as possible. 

Dependency risks
Risks arise from a dependence on particular suppliers,  customersother business partners,  products or even markets.  An over-reliance
on a supplier for a substantial portion of the Group's product volumeor an over-dependence on a particular customer,  increases the Group's
vulnerability to delivery and sales shortfalls and could lead to significant
margin pressure.  Similarly,  a strong dependence on certain products or
markets could make the Group very susceptible to swings in consumer
demand or changes in the market environment. 
To mitigate these risks,  the Group works with a broad network of
suppliers and does not have a single-sourcing model for any key
product.  Likewise,  we utilise a broad distribution strategy which includes
further expanding our controlled space activities.  This enables us to
reduce negative consequences resulting from sales shortfalls that can
occur with key customers.  Specifically,  no single customer of our Group
accounted for more than 10% of Group sales in 2012.  Furthermorewe consistently provide a well-balanced product portfolio with no
particular model or article contributing more than 1% to Group saleswhich enables us to minimise negative effects from sudden unexpected
changes in consumer demand. 
Despite our global diversification,  which reduces reliance on a particular
market as far as possible,  we still remain vulnerable to negative
developments in key sales markets such as Russia/CIS,  China or
North America as well as our important sourcing countries.  Thereforewe regard the potential impact of these risks as significant and the
likelihood of materialising as possible.

Risks related to media and stakeholder activities 
Competition risks 
The adidas Group faces considerable risk if we are unable to uphold high
levels of consumer awareness,  affiliation and purchase intent for our
brands.  Negative media coverage on our products or business practicesunfavourable stakeholder activism as well as speed and influence of
social media discussion may significantly hurt the Group's reputation and
brand image and eventually lead to a sales slowdown.  To mitigate these
risks,  we pursue pro-active,  open communication with key stakeholders
(e.g.  consumers,  media,  non-governmental organisations,  the financial
community,  etc. ) on a continuous basis.  We have also defined clear
mission statements,  values and goals for all our brands  /   GLOBAL
SEE
BRANDS STRATEGY,  P.  78  /  
SEE OTHER BUSINESSES STRATEGY,  P.  92.  These form
the foundation of our product and brand communication strategies. 
Furthermore,  we continue to invest significant marketing resources to
build brand equity and foster consumer awareness. 

Strategic alliances amongst competitors and/or retailers and
intense competition for consumers and promotion partnerships from
well-established industry peers and new market entrants (e.g.  new
brands,  vertical retailers) pose a substantial risk to the adidas Group. 
This could lead to harmful competitive behaviour,  such as price wars in
the marketplace or bidding wars for promotion partnerships.  Sustained
pricing pressure in one of the Group's key markets could threaten the
Group's sales and profitability development.  Aggressive competitive
practices could also drive increases in marketing costs,  thus hurting the
Group's profitability. 

Risks related to risk and control environment
Customer consolidation/private label risks
The adidas Group is exposed to risks from consolidation amongst
retailers as well as the expansion of retailers' own private label
businesses.  This can result in a reduction of our bargaining power or
reduced shelf space allocation from retailers. 
To mitigate this risk,  we maintain a regionally balanced sales mixfocusing on cementing strong relationships with retailers and adapting
the Group's distribution strategy with a particular focus on controlled
space initiatives  /   GLOBAL SALES STRATEGY,  P.  72.  In addition,  we are
SEE
constantly investing in strengthening brand equity to increase the
attractiveness and consumer appeal of our products  /   GLOBAL BRANDS
SEE
STRATEGY,  P.  78.  We assess the potential impact of customer consolidation
and the expansion of private label offerings as significant.  Although we
expect the consolidation trend amongst retailers and the expansion of
their own private label business to continue,  we regard the likelihood
of these risks materialising as possible due to our brand strength and
excellent relationships with key retailers worldwide. 

Failure to identify and actively manage substantial risks and to
implement and maintain adequate internal controls across the Group
could result in improper decisions,  higher costs,  compliance violation
and fraud and also cause reputational damage.  Furthermore,  a lack of
documentation of processes and procedures could result in a lack of
risk awareness among the Group's employees and facilitates fraud and
compliance violations. 
In order to adequately manage these risks,  we maintain a Global
Policy Manual that illustrates all relevant Group policies and is freely
accessible to all employees via the Group's intranet.  In addition,  we
document key business processes to create transparency and enable
the implementation of proper control mechanisms.  By operating a
Group-wide risk management system,  compliance management
system and internal control network,  we further mitigate these risks. 
Nonetheless,  we believe the potential impact of these risks could be
major,  but we consider the likelihood of being affected to such a degree
as possible. 

adidas Group   /  2012 Annual Report 
12

169
20

Nevertheless,  we continue to believe that unsubstantiated negative
media coverage,  uncontrolled social media activities and stakeholder
activism could have a significant impact on our Group.  Despite the
fast-moving and hardly controllable nature of social media as well as
ever-increasing media and other stakeholder activities worldwide,  we
now regard the likelihood of being affected to such an extent as likely. 
This is as a result of our pro-active communication approach and
continuous improvements of our communication processes. 

To moderate competition risks,  we continuously monitor competitive
and market information in order to be able to anticipate unfavourable
changes in the competitive environment rather than reacting to such
changes.  This enables us to pro-actively adjust our marketing activities
when needed.  We also pursue a strategy of entering into long-term
agreements with key promotion partners such as Real MadridChelsea FC or Derrick Rose.  As we expect competition in our industry to
remain intense,  we evaluate the potential impact for the Group as major. 
However,  given our leading position in the global sporting goods market
and our brand and marketing strength,  we assess the likelihood of an
impact of such magnitude as only possible.

Operational risks 
Consumer demand risks
Failure to anticipate and respond to changes in consumer demand
for sporting goods products is one of the most serious threats to our
industry.  Consumer demand changes can be sudden and unexpectedparticularly in our fashion-related businesses.  Because industry product
procurement cycles average 12 to 18 months,  the Group faces a risk of
short-term revenue loss in cases where it is unable to respond quickly
to such changes.  Even more critical,  however,  is the risk of continuously
overlooking a new consumer trend or failing to acknowledge its potential
magnitude over a sustained period of time. 
To mitigate these risks,  identifying and responding to shifts in consumer
demand as early as possible is a key responsibility of our brands and,  in
particular,  of the respective Risk Owners.  Therefore,  we utilise extensive
primary and secondary research tools as outlined in our risk and
opportunity identification process. 
As a leader in our industry,  our brand strategies are focused on
influencing rather than reacting to the changing consumer environment.

Even despite our mitigating actions,  the potential impact of missing
an important trend or failing to adequately tackle shifts in consumer

our Group's product offering,  feedback from retailers,  consumers and
athletes as well as evidence from our own-retail stores and other early
indicators  /   INTERNAL GROUP MANAGEMENT SYSTEM,  P.  124,  we consider
SEE
the likelihood of these risks materialising to such an extent as possible. 

Own-retail risks
New adidas,  Reebok and Rockport own-retail stores require considerable
up-front investment in furniture and fixtures as well as ongoing
maintenance.  In addition,  own-retail activities often require longer-term
lease or rent commitments.  Retail also employs significantly more
personnel in relation to sales than our wholesale business.  The higher
portion of fixed costs compared to our wholesale business may cause a
larger profitability impact in cases of significant sales declines.  Success
in own retail is predominantly related to the skills and performance of
our employees.  High turnover of staff as well as a lack of the required
skills and qualifications of own-retail employees could negatively affect
sales and profitability.  An inadequate culture with respect to operating
own-retail stores with commercial expertise may also contribute to
suboptimal business performance.  In addition,  delayed openings or
poorly executed store operations could lead to sales shortfalls and
also negatively affect brand image.  Furthermore,  inability to secure
appropriate store locations may result in a worse than expected sales
development. 
The Group reduces these risks by applying various measures.  We run
multiple training initiatives for own-retail employees at all levels,  from
store clerk to top management.  At the same time,  we constantly monitor
staff turnover and actively manage succession and career development
to reduce attrition.  Furthermore,  we only enter into new lease contracts
with durations of no more than ten years.  Store openings are managed
according to a standardised Group-wide business plan model.  Store
performance is measured by a retail scorecard consisting of nine
quantitative key performance indicators.  Underperforming stores are
reorganised,  remodelled or closed,  as appropriate. 
Our increased focus on improving our sophistication as a retailer by
investing in management expertise,  employee development as well as
in IT systems remains a key priority for 2013  /   GLOBAL SALES STRATEGYSEE
P.  72.  Nevertheless,  we believe these risks could have a major impact on
the Group's performance and we view the likelihood of materialising as
possible. 

Logistics risks
As a global company with business operations in numerous countries,  the
Group requires well-functioning logistics processes,  from the supplier to
our own warehouses and from our distribution centres to the customer. 
Any interruption of these processes could negatively affect our ability to
fulfil orders and deliver products,  leading to sales shortfalls,  additional
costs and deterioration of customer relationships.  Inability to secure
transportation or warehousing capacity,  errors by employees as well as
malfunctions in IT logistics systems could all disrupt the flow of goods.

Marketing risks
Flawless execution of marketing activities is critical to the success of
the Group and its brands.  Therefore,  unaligned product creation,  range
development,  go-to-market or brand communication processes could
lead to additional costs,  suboptimal sales performance and the inability
to resonate with the consumer as desired.  Poorly executed marketing
activities may also result in negative media coverage and hurt brand
image.  Similarly,  inadequate or insufficient investment in brand-building
could negatively affect our ability to maintain brand momentum and our
competitive edge in the marketplace. 
In order to reduce such risks,  our global and local marketing departments
are constantly cooperating and thereby ensuring consistent execution
of key initiatives.  Through continuous planning and alignment within
the marketing organisation and also cross-functionally,  we enable
both consumer relevance and operational excellence.  Despite our
brands' marketing strength and track record,  these risks could have a
significant potential impact for the Group,  and we assess the likelihood
of materialising as likely. 

Customer relationship risks
Building strong relationships with retailers to become a valuable and
reliable business partner for them is one of the guiding principles of our
Wholesale segment  /   WHOLESALE STRATEGY,  P.  73.  Failure to cement
SEE
and maintain strong relationships with retailers could have substantial
negative effects on our wholesale activities and thus the Group's business
performance.  Losing important customers in key markets due to subpar
relationship management would result in significant sales shortfalls. 
Therefore,  the Group is committed to delivering outstanding customer
service,  providing our retail partners with the support and tools to
establish and maintain a mutually successful business relationship. 
Customer relationship management is not only a key activity for our
sales force but also of highest importance to our Group's top executives
and second-line management.  As a result,  the Group's CEO,  for example
Sales and pricing risks
To achieve our sales and profitability targets,  it is paramount to
successfully convert orders into sales,  drive sell-through at the point of
sale and have product prices that are competitive in the marketplace. 
Failure to do so would result in sales and profit shortfalls.  In additionprice increases required to compensate for higher product costs might
not be realised in the marketplace,  leading to margin declines. 
To mitigate these risks,  we pursue a range of pricing strategies.  We closely
monitor order book conversion,  sell-out and sell-through performance
and adjust prices where required.  In addition,  our continuous investment
in brand-building and marketing helps us drive our business at various
price points and supports a premium positioning.  Furthermore,  we
work closely with our retail customers to minimise mark-downs and
potentially re-allocate product. 
We believe the potential impact of sales and pricing risks could be
major.  Given our brand strength,  consumer appeal and surgical pricing
activities,  we rate the likelihood of materialising only as possible. 

Supplier risks
Almost the entire adidas Group product offering is sourced through
independent suppliers,  mainly located in Asia  /   GLOBAL OPERATIONSSEE
P.  100.  To reduce the risk of business interruptions following the potential
underperformance of a supplier or a potential supplier default,  we
work with vendors who demonstrate reliability,  quality,  innovation and
continuous improvement. 
Furthermore,  in order to minimise any potential negative consequences
such as product quality shortfalls,  increased product lead times or
violation of our Workplace Standards,  we enforce strict control and

social and environmental standards throughout our supply chain  /  
SEE
SUSTAINABILITY,  P.  117.  In addition,  we have bought insurance coverage for
the risk of business interruptions caused by physical damage to supplier
premises.  As a result,  and in spite of our mitigating actions,  we assess
supplier risks as having a major potential impact.  However,  we regard
the likelihood of being impacted to such a degree as unlikely.

between the Group and its retail customers.  Should customer
relationship risks materialise,  however,  the potential impact for the
Group could be major.  However,  due to our commitment,  dedication
and continuous efforts to strengthen our partnerships with retailers,  we
regard the likelihood of materialising as unlikely.

To mitigate these risks,  we continuously monitor the global
transportation market in order to be able to quickly adapt to changes
in the transportation environment and secure required capacity.  We
work closely with multiple logistics service providers to guarantee
transportation of our products to the desired destinations.  In additionwe buy insurance coverage against theft or physical damage during
transportation and storage.  Furthermore,  in case of malfunctioning
logistics systems,  we actively re-prioritise the allocation of products to
minimise damage caused.

Inventory risks
As we place initial production orders around six months in advance
of delivery,  the adidas Group is exposed to inventory risks relating to
misjudging consumer demand at the time of production planning.  A
sudden decline in demand has the potential to cause excess inventories. 
This can have negative implications for our financial performanceincluding higher levels of clearance activity and inventory obsolescence
as well as reduced liquidity due to higher operating working capital
requirements. 
Similarly,  a sudden increase in demand can lead to product shortfalls
at the point of sale.  In this situation,  our Group faces the risk of missed
sales opportunities and/or customer and consumer disappointmentwhich could lead to a reduction in brand loyalty and hurt our reputation
as an on-time,  in-full supplier.  In addition,  the Group faces potential
profitability impacts from additional costs such as airfreight in efforts to
speed up replenishment. 

20

12

172

In order to mitigate these risks,  we continuously strive to improve our
forecasting and material planning processes.  To that end,  in 2012,  we
started to roll out and follow an enhanced forecasting approach by
aligning processes and timelines of major business functions /  
SEE
INTERNAL GROUP MANAGEMENT SYSTEM,  P.  124.  In addition,  our Global
Operations function offers sophisticated and tailored replenishment
models in order to shorten order-to-delivery times,  ensuring availability
of products while avoiding excess inventories  /   GLOBAL OPERATIONSSEE
P.  100. 

Should those risks materialise,  the potential financial impact could
be major,  reflecting the fundamental and devastating consequences
natural disasters or terrorist acts might have on our business.  As a
result of the increasing frequency of natural disasters (e.g.  earthquakesfloods,  etc. ) around the world,  we assess the likelihood of materialising
as possible. 

Personnel risks
Achieving the adidas Group's goal of becoming the global leader in
the sporting goods industry is highly dependent on our employees
and their talents.  Low employee engagement and the failure to
maintain a performance-oriented culture amongst our workforce could
substantially impede our ability to achieve our goals.  The loss of key
personnel in strategic positions is also an obvious risk to our success.  We
also face the risk of being unable to identify,  recruit and retain talented
people who best meet the specific needs of our Group.  In addition,  a
lack of sufficient training measures might cause the dilution of critical
knowledge,  in particular within the product design and development
area. 
To reduce these risks,  we strongly engage in developing a motivating
working environment and actively promote a way of working that is openhonest,  fact-based,  non-political,  efficient and collaborative.  Our goal is
to make the adidas Group the 'employer of choice" within our industry. 
Attractive reward and incentive schemes are designed to further support
long-term employee commitment  /   EMPLOYEES,  P.  111. 
SEE

Nevertheless,  the expected over-proportionate growth of the Retail
segment will increase the exposure towards swings in consumer
demand,  and also makes the Group more susceptible to the risk of
inventory shrinkage or excess inventory.  As a result,  we assess the
potential impact related to inventory clearance to be significant.  Due to
our tight control of inventory over the past twelve months,  we assess the
likelihood of materialising only as possible. 

With the expansion of our own-retail activities and the increase of
our employee base in emerging markets,  we believe that employee
turnover will slightly increase in the future.  Moreover,  labour markets
are becoming increasingly more competitive,  with the battle for the most
talented employees constantly intensifying.  As a result,  we regard the
potential impact of personnel risks as significant.  However,  given our
numerous activities,  we believe the likelihood of materialising is unlikely. 

Hazard risks 
IT risks 
The adidas Group is exposed to external risks such as natural disastersepidemics,  fire,  accidents and malicious acts.  Physical damage to our
own or our suppliers' premises,  production units,  warehouses and stock
in transit can lead to property damage and business interruption. 

Key business processes,  including product marketing,  order
management,  warehouse management,  invoice processing,  customer
support and financial reporting,  are all dependent on IT systems.  A
significant systems outage or loss of data could result in considerable
disruptions to our business.  Insufficient project management could
delay the execution of projects critical to the Group or make them more
expensive than planned.  Virus or malware attacks could also lead to
systems disruption and may result in the loss of business-critical and/or
confidential information. 

These risks are mitigated by loss prevention measures such as working
with reliable suppliers and logistics providers who guarantee high safety
standards.  In addition to the insurance coverage we have secured,  the
Group has also implemented loss prevention (e.g.  sprinklers in facilities)
and contingency plans to quickly recover business activities in order to
minimise potential negative effects.

/

Due to the critical nature of IT systems for all our business processeswe regard the potential impact as major.  With increasing data volumes
driven by the expansion of own-retail and e-commerce activities,  we now
consider the likelihood of being affected to such a degree as possible. 

Product innovation and development risks
Innovative and attractive products generate strong sales and,  more
importantly,  create a halo effect for other products.  Furthermorefulfilling the highest standards in terms of product quality and safety is
critical to sustainable commercial success and forms an integral part of
the product design and development phase.  The speed with which new
product technologies and fresh designs are brought to market is decisive
for maintaining competitive advantage.  In 2012,  all brands generated the
majority of their sales with products which had been brought to market
over the previous 12 to 18 months  /   RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT,  P.  105. 
SEE
If the adidas Group failed to maintain a pipeline of new innovative products
over a sustained period of time,  we would risk a significant sales decline. 
We are committed to pursuing our innovation and design strength.  To
ensure we can quickly adapt to changing consumer preferences,  we
focus on streamlining research and development processes to speed up
the time to market. 

Risks related to rising input costs
Raw material and labour costs account for approximately 70% of
the Group's cost of sales.  Prices of materials such as rubber,  cottonpolyester and those which closely correlate with the oil price are
especially subject to the risk of price changes.  As our ordering process
and price negotiations usually take place around six months in advance
of production,  our sourcing function has visibility and reaction time to
reflect sharp increases in input costs in its planning. 
To reduce the financial impact on our product margins from higher
sourcing costs,  we are implementing further lean manufacturing
techniques at our partner factories,  reducing time and cost in the
procurement process,  re-engineering our products and selectively
increasing prices where possible.  In addition,  the Profitability
Management department is mandated with driving strategic sourcing
initiatives to ensure competitiveness of our supply chain in light of
increasing input costs /   GLOBAL OPERATIONS,  P.  100.  In the medium
SEE
term,  we also have the ability to adapt our sourcing structure to take
advantage of more competitive pricing in other locations. 

173
12

IT project risks are further mitigated by utilising a proven project
methodology for all IT projects that includes tight cost control and
regular risk reviews for all major projects.  The IT organisation's strategic
direction and five-year plan is aligned with the adidas Group's overall
Route 2015 strategic business plan.  New quality reviews for major
projects have been implemented to ensure that the progress,  quality and
costs of those projects are regularly evaluated by members of senior
management. 

We believe innovation is a key success factor in the sporting goods
industry.  However,  due to our strong R&D track record,  we evaluate
the potential impact of product innovation and development risks as
moderate and the likelihood of materialising as likely. 

20

To mitigate these risks,  our IT organisation proactively engages in
system preventive maintenance,  service continuity planning and
adherence to applicable IT policies.  Data security is managed by
restricting user access based on job description and adhering to data
protection regulations.  Additional security measures such as anti-virus
software and firewalls are designed to further protect our systems
and critical information.  We perform multiple backups at alternating
data centre locations for the Group's core enterprise resource planning
system (ERP) on a daily basis.  In addition,  for the ERP system,  our
contingency solution allows us to quickly switch to a remote site if
necessary without any loss of data.  System security,  controls and
reliability are reviewed and tested by the Internal Audit department. 

Due to the actions we have taken over the last two years to mitigate
effects from increasing input costs,  as well as our continuous efforts
in optimising our supply chain,  we regard the potential impact related
to higher sourcing costs as moderate.  As we see volatility of global
commodity markets easing and because of our pro-active initiatives to
improve supply chain competitiveness and flexibility,  we now assess the
likelihood of materialising as likely.

Legal & compliance risks 
Social and environmental risks 
Legal risks
As a global player,  the adidas Group is exposed to various legal risksincluding contractual risks,  liability risks related to non-contractual
subject matters (e.g.  advertising claims) or the risk of claims and
litigation for infringement of third-party trademarks,  patents and other
rights.  To avoid contract breaches and prevent the Group from entering
into unfavourable contractual agreements,  we continually monitor the
fulfilment of our contractual obligations and constantly involve internal
and external legal experts in all contractual matters.  In addition,  to
reduce the risk of infringing third-party intellectual property rights,  we
carefully research new product technologies,  designs and names to
identify and avoid potential conflicts with the rights of third parties.  Our
Intellectual Property department drives enhancements in our patent
portfolio,  and in the reviewing and analysis of third-party patents. 
Despite the safeguarding measures we have in place,  we view the
potential impact as major should these risks materialise and assess the
likelihood of materialising as possible. 

Risks related to competition,  trade and customs
regulations 
20

12

174

Numerous laws and regulations regarding competition,  trade and
customs affect the adidas Group's business practices worldwide. 
Non-compliance with regulations concerning fair competition,  pricingadvertising or product imports could lead to substantial financial
penalties and additional costs as well as negative media coverage and
therefore reputational damage.  To pro-actively manage such risks,  we
constantly seek expert legal advice and provide subject matter training
to our employees.  In addition,  our internal Legal department advises
the marketing departments to ensure appropriate and compliant brand
communication.  Furthermore,  we work closely with customs authorities
and governments worldwide to make sure we adhere to customs and
import regulations and obtain the required clearance of products to fulfil
sales demand. 
As a result of the multitude of competition,  trade and customs regulations
worldwide,  we assess the potential impact on the Group,  should these
risks materialise,  as significant and the likelihood of materialising as
possible. 

We have a continuing responsibility to our employees,  suppliers and the
environment.  Malpractice in these areas,  in particular human rights
violations,  dubious employment practices as well as environmentally
harmful production processes can have a significant impact on the
reputation and operational efficiency of our Group and our suppliers. 
To limit this risk,  we have established Workplace Standards to which
suppliers must conform before and during business relationships with
the Group  /   SUSTAINABILITY,  P.  117.  Internal and external inspections of
SEE
supplier factories verified by extensive independent audits are conducted
regularly. 
In the event of non-compliance with these standards,  we develop joint
action plans and set deadlines for compliance.  If these deadlines are not
met,  business relations are terminated  /   SUSTAINABILITY,  P.  117. 
SEE
In order to minimise the environmental impact of producing and
distributing our products,  the adidas Group developed a fully
comprehensive environmental strategy (Environmental Strategy 2015). 
This strategy takes a holistic approach towards environmental issues
such as sustainable resource use,  climate change mitigation,  emissions
to water and air,  waste treatment as well as hazardous substances.  Part
of this strategy is also to extend our 'Better Place" initiative to more
adidas athletic footwear and apparel products  /   SUSTAINABILITY,  P.  117. 
SEE
Although we believe that social and environmental malpractice may
occur only in isolated cases,  we see increasing corporate social
responsibility obligations for the Group as legislative measures and
consumer expectations with regard to socially and environmentally
sound business practices and behaviour are becoming more demanding. 
Due to this development we will,  for example,  have to cope with rising
costs in order to fulfil more challenging social and environmental
requirements.  Therefore,  the potential impact on the Group could be
major.  However,  as a consequence of the strategic initiatives we are
putting in place,  we assess the likelihood as possible. 

Risks related to product counterfeiting and imitation
As popular consumer brands which rely on technological and design
innovation as defining characteristics,  the Group's brands are frequent
targets for counterfeiting and imitation.  To reduce the loss of sales and
the potential damage to brand reputation resulting from counterfeit
products,  the adidas Group makes use of extensive legal protection
(generally through registration) and works closely with law enforcement
authorities,  investigators and external legal counsel.  Although we
have stepped up measures such as product security labelling with our
authorised suppliers,  the development of these measures remains a
key priority on an ongoing basis.  In 2012,  around 13 million counterfeit
adidas Group products were seized worldwide.

The adidas Group faces a risk of selling defective products,  which
may result in injury to consumers and/or brand and product image
impairment.  We mitigate this risk by employing dedicated teams that
monitor the quality of our products on all levels of the supply chain
through rigorous testing prior to production,  close cooperation with
suppliers throughout the manufacturing process,  random testing after
retail delivery,  open communication about defective products and quick
settlement of product liability claims when necessary.  In 2012,  we did not
recall any products. 
The potential impact of product liability cases or having to conduct
wide-scale product recalls could be significant but,  given our internal
standards and control activities regarding product quality,  we regard the
likelihood as possible. 

Fraud and corruption risks
We face the risk that our employees breach rules and standards that
guide appropriate and responsible business behaviour.  This includes
the risks of fraud and corruption.  In order to successfully manage
these risks,  the Group Policy Manual was launched at the end of 2006
to provide a framework for basic work procedures and processes.  It
also includes our Code of Conduct  /   CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
SEE
INCLUDING THE DECLARATION ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE,  P.  51 which stipulates
that every employee shall act ethically in compliance with the laws and
regulations of the legal systems where they conduct Group business. 
All of our employees have to participate in a special Code of Conduct
training as part of our Global Compliance Programme. 
In addition,  we utilise controls such as segregation of duties in IT
systems to prevent fraudulent activities.  Moreover,  we have created a
network of Compliance Officers across the Group who guide and advise
our operating managers regarding fraud and corruption topics,  and we
are further strengthening our internal control activities by highlighting
key controls in our business processes to prevent and detect fraudulent
or corruptive behaviour.  Various additional mechanisms are in place to
monitor compliance.  Whenever reasonable,  we actively investigate andin case of unlawful conduct,  we work with state authorities to ensure
rigorous enforcement of criminal law. 
We believe the potential impact on the Group's performance caused by
fraud or corruption could be significant.  Despite the substantial growth
of our global workforce in recent years,  we regard the likelihood of being
impacted by fraud and corruption risks to such an extent as unlikelydue to our preventative measures and controls.  However,  we believe the
likelihood of occurrence of smaller fraud or corruption cases is higher. 

Credit risks
 credit risk arises if a customer or other counterparty to a financial
instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.  The adidas Group
is exposed to credit risks from its operating activities and from certain
financing activities.  Credit risks arise principally from accounts
receivable and,  to a lesser extent,  from other third-party contractual
financial obligations such as other financial assets,  short-term bank
deposits and derivative financial instruments /  
SEE NOTE 29,  P.  224. 
Without taking into account any collateral,  the carrying amount of
financial assets and accounts receivable represents the maximum
exposure to credit risk. 
At the end of 2012,  there was no relevant concentration of credit risk
by type of customer or geography.  Our credit risk exposure is mainly
influenced by individual customer characteristics.  Under the Group's
credit policy,  new customers are analysed for creditworthiness before
standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered. 
Tolerance limits for accounts receivable are also established for each
customer.  Both creditworthiness and accounts receivable limits are
monitored on an ongoing basis.  Customers that fail to meet the Group's
minimum creditworthiness are,  in general,  allowed to purchase products
only on a prepayment basis. 

175
12

Product quality risks 
Financial risks 
Other activities to mitigate credit risks include retention of title clauses
as well as,  on a selective basis,  credit insurances,  accounts receivable
sales without recourse and bank guarantees. 
Objective evidence that financial assets are impaired includes,  for
instance,  significant financial difficulty of the issuer or debtor,  indications
of the potential bankruptcy of the borrower and the disappearance of an
active market for a financial asset because of financial difficulties.  The
Group utilises allowance accounts for impairments that represent our
estimate of incurred credit losses with respect to accounts receivable. 
Allowance accounts are used as long as the Group is satisfied that
recovery of the amount due is possible.  Once this is no longer the casethe amounts are considered irrecoverable and are directly written off
against the financial asset.  The allowance consists of two components:
(1)  allowance established for all receivables dependent on the ageing
an
structure of receivables past due date and
(2)  specific allowance that relates to individually assessed risk for

each specific customer irrespective of ageing. 
At the end of 2012,  no Group customer accounted for more than 10% of
accounts receivable.  Based on our allowance accounts,  we believe that
the potential financial impact of our credit risks from customers could
be major but we rate the likelihood of materialising only as possible.

work with banks rated BBB+ or higher.  Only in exceptional cases are
subsidiaries authorised to work with banks rated lower than BBB+. 
To limit risk in these cases,  restrictions are clearly stipulated,  such
as maximum cash deposit levels.  In addition,  the credit default swap
premiums of our partner banks are monitored on a weekly basis.  In the
event that the defined threshold is exceeded,  credit balances are shifted
to banks compliant with the limit. 
As financial market conditions remain challenging and highly volatilewe believe that the potential financial impact is moderate and the
likelihood of materialising is unlikely.  Furthermore,  we believe our
risk concentration is limited due to the broad distribution of our
investment business with more than 20 banks.  At December 31,  2012no bank accounted for more than 5% of our investments and the average
concentration,  including subsidiaries' short-term deposits in local
banks,  was 1%.  This leads to a maximum exposure of € 98 million in
the event of default of any single bank.  We have further diversified our
investment exposure by investing into AAA-rated money market funds. 
In addition,  we held derivatives with a positive fair market value in the
amount of € 61 million.  The maximum exposure to any single bank
resulting from these assets amounted to € 8 million and the average
concentration was 5%. 

Financing and liquidity risks
Liquidity risks arise from not having the necessary resources available
to meet maturing liabilities with regard to timing,  volume and currency
structure.  In addition,  the adidas Group faces the risk of having to 
accept unfavourable financing terms due to liquidity restraints.  Our
Group Treasury department uses an efficient cash management system
to manage liquidity risk.  At December 31,  2012,  Group cash,  cash
equivalents and marketable securities amounted to € 1935 billion (2011:
€ 1370 billion).  Moreover,  our Group maintains € 1863 billion bilateral
credit lines and a € 500 million committed long-term syndicated loan
facility with international banks,  which does not include a market
disruption clause.  The € 2363 billion in credit lines are designed to
ensure sufficient liquidity at all times  /   TREASURY,  P.  141. 
SEE
Future cash outflows arising from financial liabilities that are recognised
in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position are presented in the
table above  /  
TABLE 04. 
This includes payments to settle obligations from borrowings as well as
cash outflows from cash-settled derivatives with negative market values. 
Financial liabilities that may be settled in advance without penalty are
included on the basis of the earliest date of potential repayment.  Cash
flows for variable-interest liabilities are determined with reference to
the conditions at the balance sheet date. 
In 2012,  we continued to improve our financial position substantially as
we ended the year with net cash of € 448 million (2011: € 90 million). 
Thus the ratio of net borrowings over EBITDA improved to –03 times at
year-end,  which is well in line with the Group's medium-term guideline
of less than two times.  In light of our available credit lines,  financing
structure and business model,  we assess the potential impact of these
risks on the Group as minor and the likelihood of materialising of
financing and liquidity risks as unlikely.

Based on this analysis,  a 10% increase in the euro versus the US dollar
at December 31,  2012 would have led to a € 13 million decrease in
net income.  The more negative market values of the US dollar hedges
would have decreased shareholders' equity by € 129 million.  A 10%
weaker euro at December 31,  2012 would have led to a € 12 million
increase in net income.  Shareholders' equity would have increased by
€ 158 million  /

In line with IFRS 7 requirements,  we have estimated the impact on
net income and shareholders' equity based on changes in our most
important currency exchange rates.  The calculated impacts mainly
result from fair value changes of our hedging instruments.  The analysis
does not include effects that arise from the translation of our foreign
entities' financial statements into the Group's reporting currency,  the
euro.  The sensitivity analysis is based on the net balance sheet exposureincluding intercompany balances from monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies.  Moreover,  all outstanding currency
derivatives were re-evaluated using hypothetical foreign exchange rates
to determine the effects on net income and equity.  The analysis was
performed on the same basis for both 2011 and 2012. 

(based on notional amounts,  € in millions)

Currency risks for the adidas Group are a direct result of multi-currency
cash flows within the Group.  Furthermore,  translation impacts from the
conversion of non-euro-denominated results into our Group's functional
currency,  the euro,  might lead to a material negative impact on our
Group's financial performance.  The biggest single driver behind this risk
results from the mismatch of the currencies required for sourcing our
products versus the denominations of our sales.  The vast majority of
our sourcing expenses are in US dollars,  while sales are denominated
in other currencies to a large extent most notably the euro.  Our main
exposures are presented in the adjacent table  /

Utilising a centralised currency risk management system,  our Group
hedges currency needs for projected sourcing requirements on a rolling
12- to 24-month basis  /   TREASURY,  P.  141.   Our goal is to have the vast
SEE
majority of our hedging volume secured six months prior to the start
of a given season.  In rare instances,  hedges are contracted beyond the
24-month horizon.  The Group also largely hedges balance sheet risks. 
Due to our strong global position,  we are able to minimise currency risk
to a large extent by utilising natural hedges. 
Nevertheless,  our gross US dollar cash flow exposure after natural
hedges calculated for 2013 was roughly € 40 billion at year-end 2012which we hedged using forward contracts,  currency options and currency
swaps  /  
TABLE 05.  Our Group's Treasury Policy allows us to utilise
hedging instruments,  such as currency options or option combinationswhich provide protection from negative exchange rate fluctuations
while at the same time retaining the potential to benefit from future
favourable exchange rate developments in the financial markets. 

20

178

As 2013 hedging has almost been completed,  it is clear that conversion
rates on major currencies will be less favourable compared to those of
2012.  Volume forecast variances,  currency volatility and an increasing
portion of our business in emerging markets will expose the adidas
Group to additional currency risks in 2013.  We regard the possible
financial impact of currency risks as major and believe the likelihood of
currency risks is probable. 

However,  the effect on the income statement from changes in the fair
values of hedged items and hedging instruments attributable to interest
rate changes was not material.  Exclusions from this analysis are as
follows:
/ 
Some fixed-rate financial instruments,  such as certificates of
deposit,  which we value at 'fair value through profit or loss" due to
the short-term maturity of these instruments.  Potential effects due
to changes in interest rates are considered immaterial and are not
recognised in the sensitivity analysis. 
/ 
Other fixed-rate financial instruments are measured at amortised
cost.  Since a change in interest rates would not change the carrying
amount of this category of instruments,  there is no net income impact
and they are excluded from this analysis. 
The interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift of the
interest yield curve for all currencies and was performed on the same
basis for both 2011 and 2012.  A 100 basis point increase in interest
rates at December 31,  2012 would have increased shareholders' equity
by € 000 million (2011: increase by € 000 million) and decreased net
income by € 000 million (2011: decrease by € 007 million).  A 100 basis
point decrease of the interest rates at December 31,  2012 would have
resulted in a € 000 million decrease in shareholders' equity (2011:
decrease by € 000 million) and a € 000 million increase in net income
(2011: increase by € 007 million). 
We believe the IFRS 7 interest rate analysis represents a realistic,  albeit
rough,  estimate of our current interest rate risk. 

Interest rate risks
Changes in global market interest rates affect future interest payments
for variable-interest liabilities.  As the Group does not have material
variable-interest liabilities,  significant interest rate increases should
have only slight adverse effects on the Group's profitability,  liquidity and
financial position. 
In line with IFRS 7 requirements,  we have analysed the impact of
changes in the Group's most important interest rates on net income and
shareholders' equity.  The effect of interest rate changes on future cash
flows is excluded from this analysis.  Nevertheless,  accrued interestwhich is recognised as a liability,  has been re-calculated based on
the hypothetical market interest rates as at December 31,  2012.  Fair
values for derivative interest rate instruments accounted for as cash
flow hedges were then re-evaluated based on the hypothetical market
interest rates with the resulting effects on net income and equity
included in the sensitivity analysis. 

To moderate interest rate risks and maintain financial flexibility,  a core
tenet of our Group's financial strategy is to continue to use surplus cash
flow from operations to reduce gross borrowings  /   TREASURY,  P.  141. 
SEE
Beyond that,  the adidas Group is constantly looking for adequate hedging
strategies through interest rate derivatives in order to mitigate interest
rate risks. 
In 2012,  interest rates in Europe and North America remained at low
levels.  Given the central banks' current interest rate policies and
macro-economic uncertainty,  we do not foresee any major interest rate
increases in these regions for the near-term future.  Since 97% of the
Group's financing is in euros and US dollars,  we regard the potential
impact of interest rate risks only as minor.  Nevertheless,  we assess the
likelihood that these risks will materialise as probable.

Macroeconomic and socio-political opportunities
Since we are a consumer goods company,  consumer confidence and
spending can impact our sales development.  Therefore,  better than
initially forecasted macroeconomic developments,  which support
increased private consumption,  can have a positive impact on our sales
and profitability.  Low unemployment rates,  rising real incomes as well
as a growing middle class with increasing spending power are fuelling
consumption,  particularly in emerging economies and,  subsequentlyour industry.  In addition,  legislative and regulatory changes,  e.g.  with
regard to the elimination of trade barriers,  can potentially open new
channels of distribution and positively impact Group profitability.

In the UK,  in July 2011,  new advice as to how people of all ages can
maintain fitness levels and stay or get healthy was launched as part of
the first UK-wide physical activity guidelines by the four nations' Chief
Medical Officers.  Similar health-promoting programmes and initiatives
are being launched or expanded upon around the world.  This could
lead to increases in sports participation,  in particular in categories
considered suitable for weight loss,  such as training,  running and
walking.  Given the strong global market position the adidas Group and
its brands enjoy,  acceleration in this trend could positively affect the
Group's sales development. 

Favourable financial market changes

Moreover,  continued growth in the global population,  which is estimated
to exceed nine billion by 2050,  will over time lead to increasing sports
participation and also expand the global consumer base for sports
and sports lifestyle products.  Most of this growth will be in emerging
markets,  which already play an important role in our growth strategy
and where our brands are already well positioned.  This could give an
additional boost to the Group's sales performance. 
Also,  we expect sports participation rates to increase over time,  with
increasing leisure time,  investment in infrastructure and a broadening
of awareness of the benefits of sport.  This is particularly so in countries
such as China or India,  where sports participation has historically been
lower than in industrialised countries.  In addition,  European and North
American sporting goods brands are often seen as highly desirableeasily accessible,  affordable quasi-luxury goods in emerging marketswhich presents an additional growth opportunity. 
As most of these developments are long-term structural opportunities
for the Group's top- and bottom-line performance,  the short-term
impact is assessed as moderate.  Given our ambitious goals,  we regard
the likelihood of significant short-term opportunities materialising as
unlikely.

Furthermore,  governments are increasingly promoting living an active
lifestyle to fight obesity and cardiovascular disease.  According to the
latest International Obesity Task Force (IOTF),  more than 600 million
adults are currently considered obese.  An additional billion are
estimated to be overweight.  Furthermore,  up to 200 million school-age
children are either obese or overweight.  Once considered a problem
only in affluent nations,  obesity is also becoming an issue in many
countries with low per capita income.  This development has serious
health consequences and a dramatic effect on health care expenditures. 
As a result,  governments and non-governmental organisations are
increasing their efforts to promote a healthy lifestyle and encourage
sports participation.  For example,  in 2012,  the US Department of
Education awarded 56 additional grants with a total budget of more than
US $ 27 million,  on top of approximately US $ 51 million for existing
grants,  to Local Education Agencies (LEAs) and community-based
organisations,  in order to implement comprehensive physical activity
and nutrition programmes for their students through the Carol M.  White
Physical Education Program (PEP).

Organic growth opportunities
Controlled space: The sporting goods retail environment is changing
constantly.  People increasingly want to get involved with our brands. 
We therefore continue to adapt our distribution strategy to cater for
this change and have made controlled space initiatives a strategic
priority.  This includes retail space management with key retail
partners as well as the introduction of new own-retail store formats. 
In our wholesale channels,  we continue to pilot our latest shop-in-shop
concepts globally and have also further invested in unique point-of-sale
activation.  For example,  in the USA,  we started the new adidas 'Home
Court" programme and initiated the new Reebok Fit Hub shop-in-shop
concept.  Initiatives like these could enable us to target our consumers
more effectively,  involving them more emotionally with our products
and,  therefore,  ultimately driving sell-through at our retail partners. 
Furthermore,  expanding our own-retail footprint by increasing our
store base in emerging markets such as Latin America and developed
markets such as North America,  while at the same time operating
profitably in these markets,  could contribute positively to top- and
bottom-line results.  Also,  as the Group is still a relatively immature
market participant in e-commerce,  establishing our own e-commerce
in additional markets worldwide could help drive both sales growth and
profitability. 

20

Sports-inspired lifestyle: Organic growth opportunities,  however,  are
not limited to distribution channels.  The border between pure athletics
and lifestyle continues to blur as sport becomes a more integral part in
the lives of more and more consumers.  People want to be fashionable
when engaging in sporting activities without compromising on quality
or the latest technological advances.  At the same time,  performance
features and styles are finding their way into products meant for more
leisure-oriented use.  We estimate the global sports lifestyle market to
be at least three times larger than the performance market.  This opens
up additional opportunities for our Group and our brands,  which already
enjoy strong positions in this market.  One example of this is the further
roll-out of the adidas NEO label as part of our Route 2015 strategic
business plan.  After the successful introduction in emerging marketsmainly Greater China and Russia/CIS,  in 2012,  we opened ten adidas
NEO label pilot stores in Germany in order to test this fast-fashion model
in a mature market  /   adidas Strategy,  p.  82 Successfully expanding
see
our market presence with the adidas NEO label in mature markets
globally could lead to better than expected sales development for the
Group and drive bottom-line increases. 
Women's: Our Group still generates the majority of its revenues in
men's and unisex categories.  However,  with women accounting for
more than a third of total spending on athletic footwear,  we believe
the women's sports market is one of the most attractive segments in
the sporting goods industry.  The adidas Group is therefore investing in
developing women-specific product offerings in both performance and
lifestyle that emphasise female individuality,  authenticity and style. 

Examples today include the adidas by Stella McCartney collection,  worn
by female athletes such as Olympic gold medallist Jessica Ennis for
Team GB.  Additionally,  in 2012,  the adidas Group entered into a number
of exclusive partnerships and design collaborations with female global
icons such as Alicia Keys for Reebok Classics,  Selina Gomez for the
adidas NEO label and Tara Stiles for Reebok Yoga.  These inspirational
athletes and icons may deepen our brands' connection with the female
consumer and therefore strengthen our brands and positively impact
sales development. 
New categories: Exploiting the potential of emerging,  fast-growing
sports categories is another organic growth opportunity for our brands. 
Our brand teams conduct market research and engage in trend marketing
to detect changes in lifestyle and consumer needs of our target audience
as early as possible.  Changes in lifestyle,  habits and attitudes can
potentially result in the emergence of new consumer needs that are not
addressed by current product offerings.  For example,  we see a growing
trend in the move by athletes and sports enthusiasts towards more
minimalistic products that promote natural body movement.  In order to
tap into this opportunity,  we are expanding our efforts to bring to market
more lightweight and flexible products that support the athlete's natural
course of motion.  Similarly,  we see tremendous growth potential in the
outdoor and action sports categories and intend to become a leading
player in these categories over the next few years.  Complementing
this ambition in 2012,  adidas Originals launched new products and
digital marketing activities especially dedicated to snowboardingfeaturing athlete Jake Blauvelt wearing his signature adidas Originals
snowboarding boot.  Additionally,  in fall 2012,  adidas by Stella McCartney
launched its winter sports collection,  Winter Wonderland,  comprising
ski,  snowboard and après-ski looks for the winter season 2012/13. 
These categories may perform better than currently assumed in our
projections,  depending on the speed at which we establish our credibility
with these consumers. 
Customisation and personalisation: Today's consumers are looking
for choice and variety that go beyond choosing from a wide selection of
products.  We engage in developing unique and relevant products that fit
specific functional and aesthetic requirements.  For example,  the adidasReebok and TaylorMade brands all offer different personalisation and
customisation platforms reflecting each brand's strategy.  With mi
adidas and YourReebok,  consumers can design and order completely
customised adidas and Reebok footwear online,  thereby creating their
own unique style.  This is a particularly relevant opportunity in the kids'
segment.  In addition,  TaylorMade-adidas Golf's Centres of Excellence
provide customised fitting sessions for golfers with expert fitters and
technicians.  We expect the market for personalised and customised
footwear,  apparel and hardware to grow strongly and evolve further in
the coming years,  which might support new sales growth opportunities
for the Group.

Strategic partnerships: The adidas Group in recent years has also
extended its partnership network beyond sports,  be it with academic
organisations in research and development,  designers in the fashion
industry,  other brands or non-traditional sporting goods retailers.  These
partnerships have generated multiple new growth avenues for the Groupas we have acquired product or process know-how and gained access
to new distribution channels or markets.  For example,  our partnership
with a leading denim manufacturer allowed us to gain experience with
that type of product,  which eventually helped us to establish it under
our own brand name via adidas Originals and the adidas NEO label. 
Therefore,  new partnerships in the future may enable the adidas Group
to pursue further growth opportunities. 

Continued optimisation of key business processes and strict cost
control are vital to achieving high profitability and return on invested
capital.  We are confident that there is still significant opportunity to
further streamline cost structures throughout our Group.  For examplewe continuously search for ways to increase efficiency in our supply
chain and make it truly demand-driven.  Furthermore,  by implementing
end-to-end planning processes and improving our replenishment
capabilities,  we see opportunities not only to better serve our customers
but also to reduce our operating working capital needs.  Another
example in this respect is the reduction of the number of articles; this
reduces complexity and workload in the creation area and warehouse
costs,  and allows us to offer more focused and consistent ranges to our
retail partners. 
Furthermore,  constant improvements in manufacturing excellencesuch as process simplification,  manufacturing innovation or warehouse
consolidation,  may help us optimise our production efficiency and
significantly increase profitability for the Group.  Innovations in production
could also support the Group in reducing its environmental impact,  while
at the same time enabling the Group to provide consumers with the best
value proposition possible.  For example,  a higher level of automation in
the production processes for footwear and apparel manufacturing could
result in productivity enhancements,  shorten lead times and improve
overall quality.  We have already implemented state-of-the-art machinery
and solutions such as computer stitching and welding,  high-frequency
cutting and automated production lines across factories. 
In addition,  consolidating and upgrading our distribution centres
represents an opportunity for the Group to realise further efficiency
gains,  reduce operating overheads and provide the operational ability to
drive additional revenue growth.  In 2012,  for example,  the adidas Group
completed the construction of and move to two state-of-the-art,  multibrand warehouses in South Korea and Mexico,  in both cases combining
multiple legacy facilities into one facility  /   Global Operations,  p.  100. 
see
Process improvements in other areas of the Group's business activities
could also positively impact profitability.  For example,  we are investing
considerable resources in developing our product virtualisation
capabilities,  as we believe virtualisation can bring us substantial
benefits in terms of speed,  innovation,  cost saving,  sustainability and
creativity  /   Research and Development,  p.  105. 
see
Overall,  we assess the potential impact of organisational and process
improvements as significant.  Given our numerous initiatives to improve
efficiency and operational excellence,  we regard the likelihood that such
opportunities materialise as likely. 

Taking all these together,  we see many long-term organic growth
opportunities and regard the potential impact as major.  However,  we
assess the likelihood of being positively affected to such an extent in the
short term as only possible.

Sustainable products: As consumers demand more products that are
environmentally benign and produced on a sustainable basis,  the adidas
Group continues its efforts to create meaningful product platforms
that drive growth in this area.  We remain focused on the extension of
the adidas "Better Place" programme.  Products and packaging in the
programme are designed taking sustainability principles into accountsuch as broadening the use of recycled materials and monitoring energy
use in material and product preparation.  For example,  90% of all adidas
products for the London 2012 Olympic Games contained sustainable
content.  Furthermore,  100% of athlete Village wear,  100% of Volunteer
wear and 73% of on-field performance products were designed and
developed as 'Better Place" products  /   Sustainability,  p.  117.

Opportunities related to organisational and
process improvements

Digital interactivity: Consumer demand for digital interactivity has
increased significantly in recent years as consumers realise the benefits
of incorporating real-time data on metrics such as distance,  speed
and heart rate into their training routines and into their performance
on the field.  The design and development of this functionality requires
significantly more expertise,  product and material research,  as well as
production know-how compared to traditional footwear and apparel. 
Our resources and our positioning as a sport performance leader as
well as collaborations with experts in technology and in the field of
analysing data related to athletes' movement and performance are
beginning to open up new opportunities.  For example,  in July 2012together with Major League Soccer in the USA,  adidas launched the
miCoach Elite System for football,  building on the brand's success in
personalised digital coaching.  The miCoach Elite System includes a data
cell – SpeedCell – that fits into a protective pocket between the shoulder
blades of the player's apparel base layer.  By measuring every moveheartbeat and step,  this technology enables a better understanding of
the player's performance and helps monitor the workload of an individual
player,  compare one athlete with another or view the whole team to gain
 complete picture of the squad  /   Research and Development,  p.  105. 
see
As consumer demand for this type of functionality increases,  and with
further advances in technology,  we expect that similar opportunities will
also exist in other sports categories.

Marketing and communication opportunities
Given the diverse tastes and expectations of a highly fragmented
consumer market,  there is a natural limit to the audience size a single
brand can appeal to.  Our multi-brand approach provides us with the
opportunity to leverage the power of our brands in a more precise and
meaningful way  /   Group Strategy,  p.  68.  We are able to utilise the
see
combined strengths of each brand to compete for a higher percentage of
the total market,  covering a greater number of demographics,  consumer
needs and price points. 

20

Advances in digital communication also offer significant opportunities
for our brands to engage with consumers in a deeper and more
meaningful way,  and enhance our potential to build long-lasting
relationships and brand loyalty.  The adidas Group constantly monitors
the latest developments and trends in communication technologies.  The
emergence of social media and social networks is one such example
which is helping our brands increase their consumer reach.  In this
regard,  we are investing considerable resources to present the adidas
Group's brands through a variety of social media platforms,  such as
Facebook,  YouTube or Twitter.  This is reflected in our far higher growth
rate of fans and viewers on these different social media platforms
compared to industry peers.  For example,  the adidas Originals Facebook
page alone has attracted over 18 million followers,  adding more than
six million fans over the twelve-month period.  A key advantage of these
tools is that they allow our brands to engage in a direct dialogue with
our consumers.  For example,  by offering consumers the opportunity
to actively participate in brand campaigns or in the design and creation
of new products,  we can generate a far superior brand experience.  In
2012,  we made substantial progress in developing and offering many
different mobile applications to our consumers.  By the end of the London
2012 Olympic Games,  adidas topped the PRINT Potential Rankings on
the London 2012 Social Scoreboard,  which was devoted to ranking the
social media performance of the 25 Olympic sponsors.  The research
highlighted that the adidas brand 'takethestage" campaign created
the best fan experience by telling the Olympic story in a new,  exciting
and relevant way. 

Another opportunity for the Group is the activation of promotion
partnerships with individual high-profile athletes such as Derrick Rose
or Lionel Messi.  Working closely with these athletes on joint marketing
and product initiatives could,  in addition to their on-field performancehelp establish them as true icons.  Depending on their success and
popularity,  as well as our ability to sign new future iconic partnershipsthis could generate additional sales for the Group via signature product
lines as well as increase brand equity. 
We assess the potential impact of marketing and communication
opportunities as significant.  Due to our strong portfolio of promotion
partnerships with world-class athletes in key sports,  we regard the
likelihood that those opportunities materialise to such an extent in the
short term as likely. 

Acquisition opportunities
Although the Group's focus is on organic growth initiatives,  we consider
acquisitions of smaller,  fast-growing or innovative companies as an
opportunity to generate additional sales and profits.  Furthermoreacquisition opportunities may arise as a result of challenging macroeconomic and competitive conditions that could lead to financial distress
of companies which,  while not as financially healthy as industry leaderspossess certain assets that could help the adidas Group further improve
its business performance.  However,  we regard the potential impact of
acquisition opportunities only as minor and the likelihood that such
opportunities materialise as possible. 

Personnel opportunities
Recruiting highly qualified employees,  in particular for our own-retail
segment,  may help us generate better than expected top- and
bottom-line results.  For example,  a reduction of the attrition rates in
our own-retail stores could increase conversion rates as well as store
productivity and also lead to lower expenses for recruiting activities. 
In addition,  successfully establishing a performance culture as well
as developing key talents across the Group may contribute positively
to sales and profitability improvements.  As a result,  we consider the
potential impact of such opportunities as significant,  but we assess the
likelihood of an impact of such magnitude in the short term as unlikely.

Favourable financial market changes
Favourable exchange and interest rate developments can potentially
have a positive impact on the Group's financial results.  Our Group
Treasury department closely monitors the financial markets to identify
and exploit opportunities /  
see Treasury,  p.  141.  Translation effects
from the conversion of non-euro-denominated results into our Group's
functional currency,  the euro,  might positively impact our Group's
financial performance.  Overall,  we believe favourable financial market
changes could have a major potential impact.  Given the volatility of
financial markets,  and exchange rate movements since the beginning
of 2013,  we assess the likelihood of being positively affected to such an
extent as unlikely. 

Management aggregates all risks and opportunities reported by
different business units and functions through the quarterly risk and
opportunity assessment process.  Taking into account the occurrence
likelihood and the potential financial impact of the risks explained within
this report,  the strong balance sheet as well as the current business
outlook,  Management does not foresee any material jeopardy to the
viability of the Group as a going concern.  This assessment is also
supported by the historical response to our financing demands  /  
see
Treasury,  p.  141.  The adidas Group therefore has not sought an official
rating by any of the leading rating agencies.  Management remains
confident that the Group's earnings strength forms a solid basis for our
future business development and provides the necessary resource to
pursue the opportunities available to the Group.  Compared to the prior
year,  our assessment of certain risks has changed in terms of likelihood
of occurrence and/or potential financial impact.  These changes are
reflected in the table below  /

Auditor's Report
We have audited the consolidated financial statements prepared by adidas AG,  Herzogenaurach,  comprising the statement
of financial position,  income statement,  statement of comprehensive income,  statement of changes in equity,  statement of
cash flows and the notes,  together with the management report of the Company and the Group for the business year from
January 1 to December 31,  2012.  The preparation of the consolidated financial statements and the Group management
report in accordance with IFRS,  as adopted by the EU,  and the additional requirements of German commercial law
pursuant to § 315a (1) HGB (Handelsgesetzbuch 'German Commercial Code") is the responsibility of the company's
Executive Board.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and on the Group
management report based on our audit. 

Our audit has not led to any reservations. 
In our opinion,  based on the findings of our audit,  the consolidated financial statements comply with IFRS,  as adopted by
the EU,  and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315a (1) HGB and give a true and fair
view of the net assets,  financial position and profit or loss of the Group in accordance with these requirements.  The Group
management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and as a whole provides a suitable view of the
Group's position and suitably presents the opportunities and risks of future development.

We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with § 317 HGB and German generally
accepted standards for the audit of financial statements promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (Institute of
Public Auditors in Germany) (IDW).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit such that misstatements
materially affecting the presentation of the net assets,  financial position and profit or loss in the consolidated financial
statements in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework and in the Group management report are
detected with reasonable assurance.  Knowledge of the business activities and the economic and legal environment of the
Group and expectations as to possible misstatements are taken into account in the determination of audit procedures. 
The effectiveness of the accounting-related internal control system and the evidence supporting the disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements and the Group management report are examined primarily on a test basis within
the framework of the audit.  The audit includes assessing the annual financial statements of the entities included in
consolidation,  the determination of entities to be included in consolidation,  the accounting and consolidation principles
used and significant estimates made by management,  as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated
financial statements and Group management report.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Within the scope of the first-time consolidation,  all acquired assets
and liabilities are recognised in the statement of financial position at fair
value at the acquisition date.  A debit difference between the acquisition
cost and the proportionate fair value of assets,  liabilities and contingent
liabilities is shown as goodwill.  A credit difference is recorded in the
income statement. 
Acquisitions of additional investments in subsidiaries which are
already controlled are recorded as equity transactions.  Thereforeneither fair value adjustments of assets and liabilities nor gains or losses
are recognised.  Any difference between the cost for such an additional
investment and the carrying amount of the net assets at the acquisition
date is directly recorded in shareholders' equity. 
The financial effects of intercompany transactions,  as well as
any unrealised gains and losses arising from intercompany business
relations are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial

Currency translation
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the respective
functional currency by applying the spot exchange rate valid at the
transaction date to the foreign currency amount. 
In the individual financial statements of subsidiaries,  monetary
items denominated in non-functional currencies of the subsidiaries are
generally translated into the functional currency at closing exchange
rates at the balance sheet date.  The resulting currency gains and losses
are recorded directly in the income statement. 
Assets and liabilities of the Group's non-euro functional currency
subsidiaries are translated into the presentation currency,  the eurowhich is also the functional currency of adidas AG,  at closing exchange
rates at the balance sheet date.  For practical reasons,  revenues
and expenses are translated at average rates for the period which
approximate the exchange rates on the transaction dates.  All cumulative
differences from the translation of equity of foreign subsidiaries resulting
from changes in exchange rates are included in a separate item within
shareholders' equity without affecting the income statement. 
 summary of exchange rates to the euro for major currencies in
which the Group operates is as follows:

Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments,  such as currency
options,  forward contracts as well as interest rate swaps and crosscurrency interest rate swaps,  to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange
and interest rate risks.  In accordance with its Treasury Policy,  the Group
does not enter into transactions with derivative financial instruments for
trading purposes. 
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised in the
statement of financial position at fair value,  and subsequently also
measured at their fair value.  The method of recognising the resulting
gains or losses is dependent on the nature of the hedge.  On the date a
derivative contract is entered into,  the Group designates derivatives as
either a hedge of a forecasted transaction (cash flow hedge),  a hedge
of the fair value of a recognised asset or liability (fair value hedge) or a
hedge of a net investment in a foreign entity. 
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and
qualify as cash flow hedges,  and that are effective,  as defined in IAS 39
'Financial instruments: recognition and measurement",  are recognised
in equity.  When the effectiveness is not 100%,  the ineffective portion
of the change in the fair value is recognised in the income statement. 

Accumulated gains and losses in equity are transferred to the income
statement in the same periods during which the hedged forecasted
transaction affects the income statement. 
For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges,  the
gains or losses on the derivatives and the offsetting gains or losses on
the hedged items are recognised immediately in the income statement. 
Certain derivative transactions,  while providing effective economic
hedges under the Group's risk management policies,  may not qualify
for hedge accounting under the specific rules of IAS 39.  Changes in the
fair value of any derivative instruments that do not meet these rules are
recognised immediately in the income statement. 
Hedges of net investments in foreign entities are accounted for in a
similar way to cash flow hedges.  If,  for example,  the hedging instrument
is a derivative (e.g.  a forward contract) or,  for example,  a foreign currency
borrowing,  effective currency gains and losses in the derivative and all
gains and losses arising on the translation of the borrowing,  respectivelyare recognised in equity. 
The Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments
and hedge objects at transaction inception,  as well as the risk
management objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge
transactions.  This process includes linking all derivatives designated as
hedges to specific firm commitments and forecasted transactions.  The
Group also documents its assessment of whether the derivatives that
are used in hedging transactions are highly effective by using different
methods of effectiveness testing,  such as the 'dollar offset method" or
the 'hypothetical derivative method". 
The fair values of forward contracts and currency options are
determined on the basis of market conditions on the reporting dates. 
The fair value of a currency option is determined using generally
accepted models to calculate option prices.  The fair market value of an
option is influenced not only by the remaining term of the option but also
by additional factors,  such as the actual foreign exchange rate and the
volatility of the underlying foreign currency base. 

Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents represent cash at banks,  cash on hand and
short-term deposits with maturities of three months or less from the
date of acquisition. 
Cash equivalents are short-term,  highly liquid investments that are
readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an
insignificant risk of changes in value. 

Receivables and other financial assets	
Receivables and other financial assets are recognised at fair valuewhich corresponds to the nominal value for current receivables and
other financial assets.  For non-current receivables and other financial
assets,  the fair value is estimated as the present value of future cash
flows discounted at the market rate of interest at the balance sheet date. 
Subsequently,  these are measured at amortised cost using the 'effective
interest method".  Required allowances,  if necessary,  are determined on
the basis of individual risk assessments,  and on the ageing structure of
receivables past due.

Impairment losses
If facts and circumstances indicate that non-current assets (e.g. 
property,  plant and equipment,  intangible assets including goodwill and
certain financial assets) might be impaired,  the recoverable amount
is determined.  It is measured at the higher of its fair value less costs
to sell and value in use.  An impairment loss is recognised in other
operating expenses or reported separately if the carrying amount
exceeds the recoverable amount.  If there is an impairment loss for a
cash-generating unit,  first the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated
to the cash-generating unit is reduced,  and subsequently,  provided that
the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount,  the other
non-current assets of the unit are reduced pro rata on the basis of the
carrying amount of each asset in the unit. 
Irrespective of whether there is an impairment indication,  intangible
assets with an indefinite useful life and goodwill acquired in business
combinations are tested annually for impairment. 
An impairment loss recognised in goodwill is not reversible.  With
respect to all other impaired assets,  an impairment loss recognised in
prior periods is reversed affecting the income statement if there has been
 change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.  An
impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying
amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been
determined (net of depreciation or amortisation) if no impairment loss
had been recognised. 

Assets/liabilities classified as held for sale	
Assets/liabilities classified as held for sale are primarily non-current
assets and liabilities expected to be recovered principally through sale
rather than through continuing use.  These are measured at the lower of
their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.  Assets classified
as held for sale are not depreciated on a straight-line basis. 

Property,  plant and equipment
Property,  plant and equipment are measured at amortised cost.  This
comprises any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the
condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner
intended by Management less accumulated depreciation (except for
land and construction in progress) and accumulated impairment losses. 
Depreciation is recognised over the estimated useful life utilising the
'straight-line method" and taking into account any potential residual
value,  except where the 'declining-balance method" is more appropriate
in light of the actual utilisation pattern.  Parts of an item of propertyplant and equipment with a cost that is significant in relation to the total
cost of the item are depreciated separately. 
Estimated useful lives are as follows:

5 – 50

Technical equipment and machinery as well as other equipment
and furniture and fixtures 
2 – 10

Leases
Under finance lease arrangements,  the substantial risks and rewards
associated with an asset are transferred to the lessee.  At the beginning
of the lease arrangement,  the respective asset and a corresponding
liability are recognised at the fair value of the asset or,  if lower,  the
net present value of the minimum lease payments.  For subsequent
measurement,  minimum lease payments are apportioned between
the finance expense and the reduction of the outstanding liability.  The
finance expense is allocated to each period during the lease term so as
to produce a constant periodic interest rate on the remaining balance of
the liability.  In addition,  depreciation and any impairment losses for the
associated assets are recognised.  Depreciation is performed over the
lease term or,  if shorter,  over the useful life of the asset. 
Under operating lease agreements,  rent expenses are recognised on
 straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 

Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. 
Renewals and improvements are capitalised and depreciated separatelyif the recognition criteria are met.

Merchandise and finished goods are valued at the lower of cost or net
realisable value,  which is the estimated selling price in the ordinary
course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the
estimated costs necessary to make the sale.  Costs are determined
using a standard valuation method: the 'average cost method".  Costs
of finished goods include cost of raw materials,  direct labour and the
components of the manufacturing overheads which can reasonably
be attributed.  The allocation of overheads is based on the planned
average utilisation.  The net realisable value allowances are computed
consistently throughout the Group based on the age and expected future
sales of the items on hand.

Intangible assets (except goodwill)

Goodwill 
Intangible assets are valued at amortised cost less accumulated
amortisation (except for assets with indefinite useful lives) and
impairment losses.  Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis
taking into account any potential residual value. 
Expenditures during the development phase of internally generated
intangible assets are capitalised as incurred if they qualify for recognition
under IAS 38 'Intangible Assets". 
Estimated useful lives are as follows:

Goodwill is an asset representing the future economic benefits arising
from assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually
identified and separately recognised.  This results when the purchase
cost exceeds the fair value of acquired identifiable assets,  liabilities and
contingent liabilities.  Goodwill arising from the acquisition of a foreign
entity and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assetsliabilities and contingent liabilities of that foreign entity are treated as
assets,  liabilities and contingent liabilities of the respective reporting
entity,  and are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the date of the
initial consolidation.  Goodwill is carried in the functional currency of the
acquired foreign entity. 
Acquired goodwill is valued at cost and is tested for impairment on
an annual basis and additionally when there are indications of potential
impairment. 
The cash-generating units are defined as the geographic regions
(split into wholesale and retail) which are responsible for the joint
distribution of adidas and Reebok as well as the other operating
segments TaylorMade-adidas Golf,  Rockport and Reebok-CCM Hockey. 
Compared to 2011,  Brazil is now managed separately from the rest
of Latin America.  As a result,  the number of cash-generating units
increased overall to a total of 32 (2011: 30). 
The cash-generating units (or groups of units) represent the lowest
level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal
management purposes.  The impairment test for goodwill has been
performed based on cash-generating units (or groups of units). 
The recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is determined
on the basis of value in use.  This calculation uses cash flow projections
based on the financial planning covering a five-year period in total. 
The planning is based on the adidas Group's strategic business plan
'Route 2015"  /   Group Strategy,  P.  68 until 2015 and was prolonged
see
by two further years based on historical and expected growth prospects
and margin developments until 2015.  It reflects an expected mid- to
high-single-digit sales increase for the majority of the cash-generating
units (or groups of units).  For a few emerging markets,  we expect,  on
average,  a low-double-digit sales growth rate.  Furthermore,  we expect
the operating margin to improve,  primarily driven by an improvement in
the gross margin as well as lower operating expenses as a percentage
of sales.  The planning for capital expenditure and working capital
is primarily based on past experience.  The planning for future tax
payments is based on current statutory corporate tax rates of the
single cash-generating units (or groups of units).  Cash flows beyond
this five-year period are extrapolated using steady growth rates of 17%
(2011: 17%).  According to our expectations,  these growth rates do not
exceed the long-term average growth rate of the business in which each
cash-generating unit operates.

The adidas Group determined that there was no impairment necessary
for any of its trademarks with indefinite useful lives in the years ending
December 31,  2012 and 2011.  In addition,  an increase in the discount
rate of up to 15% or a reduction of cash inflows of up to 20% would not
result in any impairment requirement. 
The recoverable amount is determined on the basis of fair value less
costs to sell (costs to sell are calculated with 1% of the fair value).  The
fair value is determined in discounting notional royalty savings after tax
and adding a tax amortisation benefit,  resulting from the amortisation
of the acquired asset ('relief-from-royalty method").  These calculations
use projections of net sales related royalty savings,  based on financial
planning which covers a period of five years in total.  The level of the
applied royalty rate for the determination of the royalty savings is based
on contractual agreements between the adidas Group and external
licensees as well as publicly available royalty rate agreements for similar
assets.  Notional royalty savings beyond this period are extrapolated
using steady growth rates of 17% (2011: 17%).  The growth rates do not
exceed the long-term average growth rate of the business to which the
trademarks are allocated. 
The discount rate is based on a weighted average cost of capital
calculation derived using a five-year average market-weighted debt/
equity structure and financing costs referencing the Group's major
competitors.  The discount rate used is an after-tax rate and reflects the
specific equity and country risk.  The applied discount rate depends on
the respective intangible asset being valued and ranges between 65%
and 84% (2011: between 65% and 81%).

Research and development
Research costs are expensed in full as incurred.  Development costs are
also expensed as incurred if they do not meet the recognition criteria of
IAS 38 'Intangible Assets". 
The Group spent € 128 million and € 115 million on product research
and development for the years ending December 31,  2012 and 2011respectively. 

Financial assets
All purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade
date.  Costs of purchases include transaction costs.  Available-for-sale
financial assets include non-derivative financial assets which are not
allocable under another category of IAS 39.  If their respective fair value
can be measured reliably,  they are subsequently carried at fair value. 
If this is not the case,  these are measured at amortised cost.  Realised
and unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value
of financial assets are included in the income statement for the period
in which they arise,  except for available-for-sale financial assets where
unrealised gains and losses are recognised in equity unless they are
impaired.

Discount rates are based on a weighted average cost of capital calculation
considering a five-year average market-weighted debt/equity structure
and financing costs referencing the Group's major competitors for each
cash-generating unit (or groups of units).  The discount rates used are
after-tax rates and reflect the specific equity and country risk of the
relevant cash-generating unit. 
As a result of the financial irregularities identified in spring 2012,  the
total goodwill of € 27 million allocated to the geographic region India was
retroactively impaired as of January 1,  2011 as part of the adjustments
according to IAS 8  /   Note 03. 
see
In total,  goodwill impairment losses of € 265 million have been
recognised in 2012 (2011: € 0 million).  Within wholesale cash-generating
units,  goodwill impairment losses amounted to € 106 million in North
America,  € 41 million in Latin America,  € 15 million in Brazil and
€ 11 million in Iberia.  The goodwill of the respective cash-generating
units is completely impaired except for the cash-generating unit
Wholesale Iberia.  The impairment losses were mainly caused by
adjusted growth assumptions for the Reebok brand,  especially in North
America,  Latin America and Brazil,  and an increase in the countryspecific discount rates as a result of the euro crisis. 
In addition,  goodwill of € 68 million allocated to Reebok-CCM
Hockey was completely impaired and € 24 million allocated to Rockport
was partially impaired.  The impairment losses are the result of changes
in the re-evaluation of future growth prospects and,  with regard to
Rockport,  also due to an increase in the discount rate. 
Even a small change in the discount rate or a reduction of planned
cash inflows would result in an additional impairment requirement of
up to € 52 million for the cash-generating units (or groups of units)
Wholesale Iberia and Rockport.  For all other cash-generating unitseven an increase in the discount rate of up to 15% or a reduction of
cash inflows of up to 20% would not result in any additional impairment
requirement.

Borrowings and other liabilities 
Provisions and expenses for pensions and similar obligations relate
to the Group's obligations for defined benefit and defined contribution
plans.  Obligations under defined benefit plans are determined
separately for each plan by valuing the employee benefits accrued in
return for their service during the current and prior periods.  These
benefit accruals are discounted to determine their present value,  and
the fair value of any plan assets is deducted in order to determine the
net liability.  The discount rate is set on the basis of yields at the balance
sheet date for high-quality corporate bonds provided there is a deep
market for high-quality corporate bonds in a given currency.  Otherwisegovernment bond yields are used as a reference.  Calculations are
performed by qualified actuaries using the 'projected unit credit
method" in accordance with IAS 19 'Employee Benefits".  Obligations for
contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as an expense
in the income statement as incurred. 
In addition to recognising actuarial gains and losses in the income
statement according to the 'corridor method",  IAS 19 grants the option
to immediately recognise actuarial gains and losses within equity. 
The Group utilises this option in order to avoid earnings volatility and
recognises actuarial gains or losses for defined benefit plans arising
during the financial year immediately within other comprehensive
income.

Pensions and similar obligations 
Borrowings and other liabilities are recognised at fair value using
the 'effective interest method",  net of transaction costs incurred.  In
subsequent periods,  long-term borrowings are stated at amortised cost
using the 'effective interest method".  Any difference between proceeds
(net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the
income statement over the term of the borrowing. 
adidas AG has issued a compound financial instrument in the form
of a convertible bond which grants the holder the right to convert the
bond into adidas AG shares.  The number of underlying shares is fixed
and does not vary subject to the fair value of the shares. 
Compound financial instruments (e.g.  convertible bonds) are divided
into a liability component shown under borrowings and into an equity
component resulting from conversion rights.  The equity component is
included in the capital reserve.  The fair value of the liability component
is determined by discounting the interest and principal payments of a
comparable liability without conversion rights,  applying risk-adjusted
interest rates.  The liability component is subsequently measured
at amortised cost using the 'effective interest method".  The equity
component is determined as the difference between the fair value of the
total compound financial instrument and the fair value of the liability
component and is reported within equity.  There is no subsequent
measurement of the equity component.  At initial recognition,  directly
attributable transaction costs are assigned to the equity and liability
component pro rata on the basis of the respective carrying amounts. 

Other provisions and accrued liabilities	
Other provisions are recognised where a present obligation (legal or
constructive) to third parties has been incurred as a result of a past
event which can be estimated reliably and is likely to lead to an outflow
of resources,  and where the timing or amount is uncertain.  Other
non-current provisions are discounted if the effect of discounting is
material. 
Accrued liabilities are liabilities to pay for goods or services that
have been received or supplied but have not been paid,  invoiced or
formally agreed with the supplier,  including amounts due to employees. 
Here,  however,  the timing and amount of an outflow of resources is not
uncertain. 

Recognition of revenues
Sales are recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or
receivable,  net of returns,  trade discounts and volume rebates,  when the
significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods are transferred to
the buyer,  and when it is probable that the economic benefits associated
with the transaction will flow to the Group. 
Royalty and commission income is recognised based on the contract
terms on an accrual basis. 

Advertising and promotional expenditures
Production costs for media campaigns are included in prepaid expenses
(other current and non-current assets) until the services are receivedand upon receipt expensed in full.  Significant media buying costs are
expensed over the intended duration of the broadcast. 
Promotional expenses that involve payments,  including one-time
up-front payments for promotional contracts,  are expensed on a
straight-line basis over the term of the agreement.

Income taxes
Current income taxes are computed in accordance with the applicable
taxation rules established in the countries in which the Group operates. 
The Group computes deferred taxes for all temporary differences
between the carrying amount and the tax base of its assets and liabilities
and tax loss carry-forwards.  As it is not permitted to recognise a deferred
tax liability for goodwill,  the Group does not compute any deferred taxes
thereon. 
Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences
and tax loss carry-forwards which exceed taxable temporary differences
are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that the company
concerned will generate sufficient taxable income to realise the
associated benefit. 
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the
extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity,  in which case
it is recognised in equity. 

Estimation uncertainties and judgements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS
requires the use of assumptions and estimates that affect reported
amounts and related disclosures.  Although such estimates are based
on Management's best knowledge of current events and actions,  actual
results may ultimately differ from these estimates. 
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of
estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date which have a significant
risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities within the next financial year are outlined in the respective

Judgements have,  for instance,  been used in classifying leasing

assets. 

At Reebok India Company (hereinafter 'Reebok India"),  numerous
financial irregularities were identified in March 2012.  As a result,  the
services of the then Managing Director (MD) and Chief Operating Officer
were terminated,  and a new MD was instated.  Immediately on becoming
aware of the aforesaid financial irregularities,  Reebok India carried
out an externally assisted internal investigation and filed a criminal
complaint with the police.  This resulted in an investigation which is
being carried out by the Special Economic Wing of the Gurgaon Police. 
Additionally,  various other regulatory agencies are conducting specific
investigations into various aspects of the case. 
Key findings from the internal investigation include inappropriate
recognition of sales due to sales cut-off irregularities,  a failure to book
sales returns and a failure to correctly post credit notes to accounts
receivable.  This also resulted in a significant overstatement of the
accounts receivable balances as well as materially incorrect accounting
for inventories and provisions.  During the investigation process,  the new
management also discovered four secret warehouses not disclosed in
the official accounting records.  The investigations also revealed that
Reebok India had adopted inappropriate procedures to artificially reduce
the accounts receivable balance.  The findings of the investigations
suggest that the practice of inflating sales and profits had been going
on for several years. 
The discovery of these activities resulted in the identification of
material errors in the prior period financial statements of Reebok
India.  As a consequence of these errors,  material misstatements are
also included in the consolidated financial statements of adidas AG for

Moreover,  as a result of these adjustments relating to the financial year
2011,  the consolidated statement of changes in equity,  the consolidated
statement of comprehensive income and the comparative amounts for
2011 in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements also had to
be restated accordingly.  In addition,  a correction of the consolidated
statement of changes in equity at the time of the opening balance as at
January 1,  2011 was necessary. 
In particular,  the following errors had to be adjusted:

20

12

208

The required corrections led to a reduction of cash and cash equivalents
of € 5 million and an increase in accounts receivable of € 27 million
as well as an increase in short-term borrowings of € 11 million and in
other current and non-current financial liabilities of € 11 million in the
opening consolidated balance sheet as at January 1,  2011. 
For the year ending December 31,  2011,  the correction led to an
increase in accounts receivable as well as other current and non-current
financial liabilities of € 6 million. 

a) Manipulation of sales and accounts receivable
Through different practices,  Reebok India overstated net sales and
accounts receivable,  whereas inventories were understated as at
December 31,  2011 and in previous financial years. 
This was achieved through the following practices:
/ 
Issuing invoices to customers,  even though inventories were not
delivered at the time of invoicing,  but stored in secret warehouses of
Reebok India or in warehouses of a shipping company. 
/ 
Entering into sales agreements with distributors which did not
transfer risk and rewards. 
/  recording sales returns received from customers at the time of
Not
return and storing the returned inventory in secret warehouses. 
/ 
Issuing unjustified invoices,  for example,  for subsequent price
increases,  or not recording valid credit notes to customers. 
/  incorrect or omitted recording of contractual obligations towards
The
customers. 
As a result of these practices,  the allowances for inventories and the
provision for sales returns were also determined incorrectly. 
The impact on the opening consolidated statement of financial
position as at January 1,  2011 and the consolidated statement of financial
position as at December 31,  2011 is as follows:

c) Unrecorded liabilities and provisions
 significant number of vendor invoices and provisions relating to
commitments given to business partners were not recorded.  Amongst
others,  this included committed subsequent sales discounts as well as
termination penalties in connection with store closures. 
Furthermore,  in the statement of financial position,  Reebok India has
not recognised onerous contracts relating to contracts with franchisees
which will incur losses over the remaining contractual term due to
minimum guarantee agreements in favour of the franchisees. 
The impact on the consolidated financial statements as at
December 31,  2011 is as follows:

d) Goodwill
Deducting the overstated sales and income in the business plans
established in the previous years would have resulted in full impairment

consolidated balance sheet as at January 1,  2011.

b) Fictitious cash collections
Reebok India recorded fictitious cash collections of outstanding
accounts receivable.  This scheme involved agreements with business
partners,  whereby Reebok India transferred money to business partners
in January 2011 while at the same time receiving cheques back-dated to
December 2010 from those same partners. 
In addition,  in 2011,  Reebok India initiated a programme to roll
out further franchise stores,  whereby the investees had to make a
prepayment which was recorded as collection of various outstanding
customer accounts instead of recording a financial liability against the
investor. 

e) Deferred tax assets
Deferred tax assets of € 7 million and € 9 million for the years ending
December 31,  2010 and 2011,  respectively,  were recognised by Reebok
India.  Deducting the overstated sales and income in the business plans
established in the previous years would have resulted in a business plan
which does not support the probability of the utilisation of these deferred
tax assets. 
The required corrections led to a decrease of deferred tax assets
in the opening consolidated balance sheet as at January 1,  2011 of
€ 7 million.  For the year ending December 31,  2011,  the deferred tax
asset was reduced by € 9 million and tax expense for the year ending
December 31,  2011 was increased by € 4 million as the recognition
criteria for deferred tax assets were not fulfilled anymore.

Effective March 30,  2012,  adidas AG acquired the remaining 10% share
in its German subsidiary GEV Grundstücksgesellschaft Herzogenaurach
mbH & Co.  KG,  which was formerly reported as a non-controlling interest
in other liabilities in compliance with IAS 32 'Financial Instruments:
Presentation"  /   Note 27.  The purchase price of € 7 million was paid

at the beginning of April 2012. 
Effective June 1,  2012,  Taylor Made Golf Co.,  Inc.  completed the
acquisition of Adams Golf,  Inc.  ('Adams Golf").  Based in Plano,  Texas
(USA),  Adams Golf designs,  assembles and distributes golf clubs.  With
this acquisition,  the adidas Group intends to further improve its market
position within the golf industry.  The entire business of Adams Golf was
purchased for a purchase price of US $ 89 million in cash. 
The acquisition had the following effect on the Group's assets and

The following valuation methods for the acquired assets were applied:
/ Inventories: For finished goods,  the 'comparative sales method"
was used,  which estimates the expected sales price of the respective
inventory,  reduced for all costs expected to be incurred in its completion/
disposition and a profit on those costs.  The value of the component parts
was determined by estimating the cost to replace each component. 
/ Trademarks and other intangible assets: The 'relief-from-royalty
method" was applied for the trademarks/trade names as well as for
patents and technology.  The fair value was determined by discounting
notional royalty savings after tax and adding a tax amortisation benefitresulting from the amortisation of the acquired asset.  For the valuation of
customer contracts and related customer relationships,  the 'distributor
method" was used under the 'income approach". 
The purchase price allocation is considered to be preliminary with
regard to the tax items. 
The excess of the acquisition cost paid versus the net of the
amounts of the fair values assigned to all assets acquired and liabilities
assumed,  taking into consideration the respective deferred taxes,  was
recognised as goodwill.  It mainly arises from expected synergies and the
resulting expansion of the product portfolio of TaylorMade-adidas Golf. 
Any acquired asset that did not meet the identification and recognition
criteria for an asset was included in the amount recognised as goodwill. 
The goodwill arising on this acquisition was allocated to the
cash-generating unit TaylorMade-adidas Golf at the time of the
acquisition.  The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes and is
denominated in US dollars as the local functional currency  /   Note 02. 
see
The acquired subsidiary generated net sales of € 33 million as well
as net losses of € 22 million for the period from June to December
2012.  If this acquisition had occurred on January 1,  2012,  total Group
net sales would have been € 149 billion and net income attributable
to shareholders would have been € 534 million for the year ending
December 31,  2012. 
Effective August 31,  2012,  adidas AG acquired the remaining 15% of
the shares of its subsidiary in Hungary,  adidas Budapest Kft.,  Budapestfor a purchase price of € 1 million.  This acquisition represented an
equity transaction,  whereby no goodwill has been incurred. 
At September 30,  2012,  90% of the shares in Immobilieninvest und
Betriebsgesellschaft Herzo-Base GmbH & Co.  KG,  whose assets and
liabilities were classified as held for sale,  were sold for a purchase price
of € 14 million  /   Note 11.  The remaining 10% of the shares continue
see
to be held by the Group and are recorded under long-term financial
assets  /   Note 15.  The sale led to a gain of € 1 million. 
see
Effective November 4,  2011,  adidas America Inc.  signed a share
purchase agreement to acquire Stone Age Equipment,  Inc.  ('Five Ten")
based in Redlands,  California (USA).  Five Ten is a company in the outdoor
action sports sector,  which focuses on categories such as climbing
and mountain biking.  Through the acquisition of Five Ten,  the adidas
Group intends to improve its position in the outdoor category,  which
provides significant growth opportunities as articulated in the Group's
strategic business plan 'Route 2015".  The entire business of Five Ten
was purchased for a purchase price in the amount of US $ 25 million
in cash and contingent payments in an amount of US $ 13 million,  of
which US $ 3 million was paid up front.  The contingent payments are
dependent on Five Ten achieving certain performance measures over
the first three years after the acquisition. 

The acquisition had the following effect on the Group's assets and
liabilities,  based on a purchase price allocation:

The following valuation methods for the acquired assets were applied:
/ Trademark: The 'relief-from-royalty method" was applied for the
trademark/trade name.  The fair value was determined by discounting
notional royalty savings after tax and adding a tax amortisation benefitresulting from the amortisation of the acquired asset. 
/  Other intangible assets: For the valuation of technologies and
other intangible assets,  the 'multi-period-excess-earnings method"
was used.  The respective future excess cash flows were identified and
adjusted in order to eliminate all elements not associated with these
assets.  Future cash flows were measured on the basis of the expected
sales by deducting variable and sales-related imputed costs for the use
of contributory assets.  Subsequently,  the outcome was discounted using
the appropriate discount rate and adding a tax amortisation benefit.

06  hort-term financial assets

Short-term financial assets are classified at 'fair value through profit or
loss".  Changes in the fair value are recognised in the income statement
as they occur. 
The majority of short-term financial assets are marketable securities
relating to structured deposits. 

With respect to accounts receivable as at the balance sheet date past
due but not impaired,  based on credit history and current credit ratingsthere are no indications that customers will not be able to meet their
obligations. 
Further,  no indications of default are recognisable for accounts
receivable that are neither past due nor impaired.

The excess of the acquisition cost paid versus the net of the amounts of
the fair values assigned to all assets acquired and liabilities assumedtaking into consideration the respective deferred taxes,  was recognised
as goodwill.  Any acquired asset that did not meet the identification and
recognition criteria for an asset was included in the amount recognised
as goodwill. 
The goodwill arising on this acquisition was allocated to those
cash-generating units operating in the outdoor product segment at
the time of the acquisition.  The goodwill is denominated in the local
functional currency  /   Note 02. 
see
The acquired subsidiary generated net sales of € 1 million as well
as net losses of € 0 million for the period from November to December
2011.  If this acquisition had occurred on January 1,  2011,  total Group
net sales would have been € 133 billion (restated) and net income
attributable to shareholders would have been € 613 million (restated)
for the year ending December 31,  2011.

The majority of goodwill which primarily relates to the acquisition of
the Reebok business in 2006 is denominated in US dollars.  A currency
translation effect of negative € 12 million and € 30 million was recorded
for the years ending December 31,  2012 and 2011,  respectively. 
The Group determines whether goodwill impairment is necessary
at least on an annual basis.  This requires an estimation of the value
in use of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill is allocated. 
Estimating the value in use requires the Group to make an estimate of
the expected future cash flows from the cash-generating units and also
to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value
of those cash flows. 
Goodwill impairment losses for 2012 amounted to € 265 million
(2011: € 0 million).  The goodwill impairment amount related to
2012 comprises an impairment loss within the Wholesale segment
(€ 173 million) and an impairment loss within the Other Businesses
segment (€ 92 million)  /   also Note 02. 
see
Future changes in expected cash flows and discount rates may lead
to impairments of the reported goodwill in the future.  For details see

Trademarks 
Trademarks and other intangible assets 
At December 31,  2012,  trademarks,  mainly related to the acquisition of
Reebok International Ltd.  (USA) in 2006 and Ashworth,  Inc.  in 2008,  have
indefinite useful lives.  This is due to the expectation of permanent use of
the acquired brand names. 
The reported other trademarks mainly relate to the brand names
Ashworth,  Adams Golf and Five Ten.  The increase of € 10 million
compared to 2011 is a result of the acquisition of Adams Golf,  effective
June 1,  2012  /   Note 04. 
see
The Group tests at least on an annual basis whether trademarks
with indefinite useful lives are impaired.  This requires an estimation
of the fair value less costs to sell of the trademarks.  As part of this
estimation,  the Group is required to make an estimate of the expected
future trademark-specific sales and appropriate arm's length notional
royalty rates from the cash-generating unit and also to choose a suitable
discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. 
There was no need for impairment for the years ending December 312012 and 2011. 
Future changes in expected cash flows and discount rates may lead
to impairments of the accounted trademarks in the future. 
As part of the goodwill impairment test,  the Reebok trademark is
allocated on a pro-rata basis to the cash-generating units (or groups
of units).  Thereof,  the major shares relate to Retail CIS (€ 263 million)Retail North America (€ 204 million),  Wholesale North America
(€ 171 million),  Wholesale Latin America (€ 80 million) and Wholesale
Japan (€ 74 million). 
Amortisation expenses for intangible assets with definite useful lives

15 Long-term financial assets 
17  ther non-current assets


Long-term financial assets primarily include a 91% investment in
FC Bayern München AG (2011: 91%) of € 79 million (2011: € 79 million). 
This investment is classified as 'fair value through profit or loss" and
recorded at fair value.  This equity security does not have a quoted market
price in an active market.  Therefore,  existing contractual settlements
were used in order to calculate the fair value as at December 31,  2012. 
The line item investments and other financial assets comprises
the shares in Immobilieninvest und Betriebsgesellschaft Herzo-Base
GmbH & Co.  KG  /   Note 04 as well as other minority shareholdings
see
amounting to € 11 million (2011: € 0 million) which are classified as
'available-for-sale" and measured at amortised cost as a reliable
determination of the fair value is impossible without having concrete
negotiations regarding a sale.  These shares are unlisted and do not have
an active market.  There is no intention to sell these shares. 
Additionally,  long-term financial assets include investments which
are mainly invested in insurance products and are measured at fair
value,  as well as other financial assets.

18  orrowings and credit lines

Borrowings are denominated in a variety of currencies in which the
Group conducts its business.  The largest portions of effective gross
borrowings (before liquidity swaps for cash management purposes) as
at December 31,  2012 are denominated in euros (2012: 68%; 2011: 56%)
and US dollars (2012: 29%; 2011: 35%). 
The weighted average interest rate on the Group's gross borrowings
decreased to 44% in 2012 (2011: 49%). 
As at December 31,  2012,  the Group had cash credit lines and
other long-term financing arrangements totalling € 38 billion (2011:
€ 52 billion); thereof unused credit lines accounted for € 23 billion
(2011: € 39 billion).  In March 2012,  adidas AG issued a convertible bond
for an amount of € 500 million.  Due to the cash inflow arising from the
issuance of the convertible bond and due to the expensive syndicated
loan market,  the syndicated loan facility was reduced from € 20 billion
to € 500 million.  This decrease in credit lines is the main reason for
the significant decrease in the Group's total credit lines.  In additionat December 31,  2012,  the Group had separate lines for the issuance
of letters of credit and guarantees in an amount of approximately
€ 200 million (2011: € 200 million). 
The Group's outstanding financings are unsecured and may include
standard financial covenants,  which are reviewed on a quarterly basis. 
These covenants may include limits on the disposal of fixed assets,  the
maximum amount of debt secured by liens,  cross default provisions and
change of control.  In addition,  certain financial arrangements contain
equity ratio covenants,  minimum equity covenants as well as net loss
covenants. 
As at December 31,  2012,  and December 31,  2011,  shareholders'
equity was well above the amount of the minimum equity covenant. 
Likewise,  the relevant amount of net income clearly exceeded net loss
covenants.

The above table includes a Eurobond issued on July 6,  2009 in a nominal
amount of € 500 million and with a maturity of five years.  The Eurobond
with an annual coupon of 475% was issued in denominations of € 1000
each and was priced with a spread of 200 basis points above the
respective euro mid-swap.  The issue was fixed at 99865%. 
In addition,  gross borrowings include a convertible bond for an
aggregate nominal amount of € 500 million divided into denominations
of € 200000 which was issued on March 21,  2012.  The bond has a
maximum maturity (including prolongation options) until June 14,  2019. 
The coupon of the bond amounts to 025% and is payable annuallycommencing on June 14,  2013.  The bond is,  at the option of the respective
holder,  convertible at any time from and including May 21,  2012,  up
to and including June 5,  2019,  into up to 599 million new or existing
adidas AG shares.  The convertible bond has a conversion premium
of 40% above the reference price of € 5961,  resulting in a current
conversion price of € 8346 per share.  On June 14,  2017,  the bondholders
have the right to call the bond at nominal value plus interest accrued
on the nominal amount.  adidas AG is entitled to redeem the remaining
bonds in whole if,  at any time,  the aggregate principal amount of bonds
outstanding falls below 15% of the aggregate principal amount of the
bonds that were initially issued.  Furthermore,  as of July 14,  2017 at the
earliest,  adidas AG is entitled to redeem the bonds in whole if on 20 of
30 consecutive trading days,  the share price of adidas AG exceeds the
current conversion price of € 8346 by at least 30%. 
According to IAS 32 'Financial Instruments: Presentation",  the
conversion right represented in the convertible bond constitutes a
financial instrument which is covered in the capital reserve in an
amount of € 55 million after deduction of the issuance cost.  The liability
component amounts to € 441 million after deduction of the issuance
cost and is shown within long-term borrowings.  The difference of
€ 59 million compared to the nominal amount of € 500 million is accrued
as interest expense of the financial liability over the expected maturity
of the convertible bond using the 'effective interest method".  As at
December 31,  2012,  the financial liability amounted to € 449 million.

Sundry provisions mainly include provisions for customs risks as
well as anticipated losses from purchases and other transactions,  and
contingent losses from pending lawsuits. 
Management follows past experience from similar transactions
when estimating the amounts recognised as other provisions while
considering all evidence from events until the preparation of the

Marketing provisions mainly consist of provisions for promotion
contracts. 
Provisions for personnel mainly consist of provisions for shortand long-term variable compensation components.  With regard to
provisions for early retirement,  claims for reimbursement in an amount
of € 1 million (2011: € 1 million) are shown under other non-current
assets. 
Provisions for returns,  allowances and warranty primarily arise due
to bonus agreements with customers and the obligation of fulfilling
customer claims with regard to the return of products sold by the
Group.  The amount of the provision follows the historical development of

Given the diverse Group structure,  different defined benefit plans existcomprising a variety of post-employment benefit arrangements.  The
Group's major defined benefit plans relate to adidas AG and subsidiaries
in the UK and Japan.  The defined benefit plans of adidas AG mainly
relate to direct pension commitments as well as commitments which
relate to the Executive Board and which are managed through a pension
fund in combination with a reinsured support fund.  The benefit plans
generally provide payments in case of death,  disability or retirement
to former employees and their survivors.  The obligations arising from
defined benefit plans are partly covered by plan assets.  In 2011,  the
defined benefit plan offered at one of the Japanese subsidiaries of
adidas AG was converted into a defined contribution plan,  resulting in
 plan settlement. 
The following tables analyse the defined benefit plans,  plan assetspresent values of the defined benefit plans,  expenses recognised in
the consolidated income statement,  actuarial assumptions and other
information.

The asset ceiling effect arises from a funded defined benefit plan
in Germany and is recognised in the consolidated statement of
comprehensive income. 
The determination of assets and liabilities for defined benefit plans
is based upon statistical and actuarial valuations.  In particular,  the
present value of the defined benefit obligation is driven by financial
variables (such as the discount rates or future increases in salaries) and
demographic variables (such as mortality and employee turnover).  The
actuarial assumptions may differ significantly from the actual resultsi, e.  the present value of the actual future performance may differ from
the reported present value.

The actuarial assumptions as at the balance sheet date are used to
determine the defined benefit liability at that date and the pension
expense for the upcoming financial year. 
The actuarial assumptions for withdrawal and mortality rates are
based on statistical information available in the various countries,  the
latter for Germany on the Heubeck 2005 G mortality tables. 
The calculation of the pension liabilities in Germany is based on a
discount rate determined using the Mercer Pension Discount Yield Curve
(MPDYC) approach which was adjusted in 2012 due to the current market
development.  Had a discount rate been used which was based on the
previous year-end's approach,  the defined benefit obligation would have
increased by approximately € 20 million.

The Group recognises actuarial gains or losses arising in defined
benefit plans during the financial year immediately outside the income
statement in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
The actuarial losses recognised in this statement for 2012 amount to
€ 35 million (2011: € 13 million).  The accumulated actuarial losses
recognised amount to € 86 million (2011: € 51 million). 
In 2012,  the expected return on plan assets assumption was set
separately,  by aggregating the expected rate of return for each asset
class over the underlying asset allocation,  for the various benefit plans. 
Historical markets were studied and expected returns were based on
widely accepted capital market principles.

Around 85% of the plan assets are related to plan assets in the UKGermany and Switzerland. 
In the UK,  the plan assets are held under trust within the pension
fund.  In Germany,  the plan assets are invested in insurance contracts
and in a pension fund.  The plan assets in Switzerland are held by a
pension foundation.  In the rest of the world,  the plan assets consist
predominantly of insurance contracts. 
The expected payments for 2013 amount to € 11 million.  Thereof€ 7 million relate to benefits paid directly by the Group companies and
€ 4 million to employer contributions paid into the plan assets.  In 2012the actual return on plan assets was € 7 million (2011: € 0 million).

unchanged since December 31,  2011.  As at the balance sheet date,  and
in the period beyond,  up to and including February 22,  2013,  it amounted
to € 209216186 divided into 209216186 registered no-par-value shares
('registered shares") and is fully paid in. 
Each share grants one vote and is entitled to dividends starting from
the beginning of the year it was issued.  Treasury shares held directly or
indirectly are not entitled to dividend payment in accordance with § 71b
German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz AktG).  Neither at the
balance sheet date nor at February 22,  2013 does the company hold any
treasury shares.

The Executive Board of adidas AG did not make use of the existing
amounts of authorised capital of up to € 95 million in the 2012 financial
year or in the period beyond the balance sheet date up to and including
February 22,  2013. 
The authorised capital of the company,  which is set out in § 4 sections
2,  3 and 4 of the Articles of Association as at the balance sheet dateentitles the Executive Board,  subject to Supervisory Board approval,  to
increase the nominal capital
until June 21,  2014
/  by issuing new shares against contributions in cash once or several
times by no more than € 50 million and,  subject to Supervisory Board
approval,  to exclude residual amounts from shareholders' subscription
rights (Authorised Capital 2009/I);
until July 4,  2014
/  by issuing new shares against contributions in kind once or several
times by no more than € 25 million and,  subject to Supervisory Board
approval,  to exclude shareholders' subscription rights (Authorised
Capital 2011);
until July 12,  2015
/  by issuing new shares against contributions in cash once or several
times by no more than € 20 million and,  subject to Supervisory Board
approval,  to exclude residual amounts from shareholders' subscription
rights and to exclude shareholders' subscription rights when issuing
the new shares at a value not essentially below the stock market
price of shares with the same features (Authorised Capital 2010).  The
authorisation to exclude subscription rights pursuant to the previous 
The following description of the Contingent Capital is based on § 4
section 5 of the Articles of Association of the company as well as on the
underlying resolutions of the Annual General Meeting held on May 62010.  Additional contingent capital does not exist. 
At the balance sheet date,  the nominal capital is conditionally
increased by up to € 36 million divided into no more than 36000000
registered shares (Contingent Capital 2010).  The contingent capital
increase will be implemented only to the extent that holders or creditors
of option or conversion rights or the persons obligated to exercise
option or conversion duties on bonds issued by the company or a
group company,  pursuant to the authorisation of the Executive Board
granted by the resolution adopted by the Annual General Meeting of
May 6,  2010,  up to May 5,  2015 and guaranteed by the company,  exercise
their option or conversion rights or,  if they are obliged to exercise
the option or conversion duties,  meet their obligations to exercise
the warrant or convert the bond,  or to the extent that the company
exercises its rights to choose to deliver shares in the company for the
total amount or partially instead of a payment and insofar as no cash
settlement,  treasury shares or shares of another public-listed company
are used to serve these rights.  The new shares shall be issued at the
respective option or conversion price to be established in accordance
with the aforementioned authorisation resolution.  The new shares
shall carry dividend rights from the commencement of the financial
year in which the shares are issued.  The Executive Board is authorisedsubject to Supervisory Board approval,  to stipulate any additional details
concerning the implementation of the contingent capital increase.

Supervisory Board,  made partial use of the authorisation of the
Annual General Meeting from May 6,  2010,  and on March 21,  2012
issued a convertible bond due on June 14,  2019 in a nominal value of
€ 500 million via an offer to institutional investors outside the USA

The Group's policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to
uphold investor,  creditor and market confidence and to sustain future
development of the business. 
The Group seeks to maintain a balance between a higher return on
equity that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings and the
advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position.  The Group
further aims to maintain net debt below two times EBITDA over the long
term. 
Financial leverage is defined as the ratio between net borrowings
(short- and long-term borrowings less cash and cash equivalents as well
as short-term financial assets) in an amount of negative € 448 million
(2011: negative € 90 million) and shareholders' equity in an amount
of € 5304 billion (2011 restated: € 5137 billion).  EBITDA amounted to
€ 1445 billion for the financial year ending December 31,  2012 (2011
restated: € 1199 billion).  The ratio between net borrowings and EBITDA
amounted to negative 03 for the financial year ending December 312012 (2011 restated: negative 01).

Finance leases
The Group also leases various premises for administration and
warehousing which are classified as finance leases. 
The net carrying amount of these assets of € 19 million and € 9 million
was included in property,  plant and equipment as at December 31,  2012
and 2011,  respectively.  For the year ending December 31,  2012,  interest
expenses were € 0 million (2011: € 0 million) and depreciation expenses
were € 3 million (2011: € 2 million). 
The minimum lease payments under these contracts over their
remaining terms up to 2018 and their net present values are as follows:

After 5 years 
Due to the short-term maturities of cash and cash equivalentsshort-term financial assets,  accounts receivable and payable as well as
other current financial receivables and payables,  their respective fair
values approximate their carrying amount. 
The fair values of non-current financial assets and liabilities are
estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using current
interest rates for debt of similar terms and remaining maturities,  and
adjusted by an adidas Group specific credit risk premium. 
Fair values of long-term financial assets classified as availablefor-sale are based on quoted market prices in an active market or are
calculated as present values of expected future cash flows. 
The fair values of forward contracts and currency options are
determined on the basis of market conditions at the balance sheet
date.  The fair value of a currency option is determined using generally
accepted models to calculate option prices,  such as the 'GarmanKohlhagen-model".  The fair market value of an option is influenced not
only by the remaining term of the option,  but also by other determining
factors such as the actual foreign exchange rate and the volatility of the
underlying foreign currency base.

Financial instruments for the hedging of foreign
exchange risk

228

The fair value of all outstanding currency hedging instruments is as
follows:

The adidas Group uses natural hedges and arranges forward contractscurrency options and currency swaps to protect against foreign
exchange risk.  As at December 31,  2012,  the Group had outstanding
currency options with premiums paid totalling an amount of € 4 million
(2011: € 5 million).  The effective part of the currency hedges is directly
recognised in hedging reserves and as part of the acquisition costs of
inventories,  respectively,  and posted into the income statement at the
same time as the underlying secured transaction is recorded.  An amount
of € 4 million after taxes (2011: € 17 million) for currency options and
an amount of negative € 7 million after taxes (2011: € 101 million) for
forward contracts were recorded in hedging reserves.  Currency option
premiums impacted net income in the amount of € 4 million in 2012
(2011: € 6 million). 
The total time value of the currency options not being part of a hedge
in an amount of negative € 3 million (2011: € 2 million) was recorded in
the income statement in 2012.  Due to a change in the exposure,  some
of the currency hedges were terminated and consequently an amount
of € 1 million was reclassified from hedging reserves to the income
statement. 
In the years ending December 31,  2012 and 2011,  hedging
instruments related to product sourcing were bought to hedge a total
net amount of US $ 51 billion and US $ 48 billion,  respectively. 
The notional amounts of all outstanding currency hedging
instruments,  which are mainly related to cash flow hedges,  are
summarised in the following table:

Total 
 total net fair value of negative € 10 million (2011: € 115 million)
for forward contracts related to hedging instruments falling under
hedge accounting as per definition of IAS 39 'Financial Instruments:
Recognition and Measurement" was recorded in the hedging reserve. 
The remaining net fair value of € 9 million (2011: € 10 million),  mainly
related to liquidity swaps for cash management purposes and to
forward contracts hedging intercompany dividend receivables,  was
recorded in the income statement.  The total fair value of € 2 million
(2011: € 28 million) for outstanding currency options related to cash
flow hedges.  This consists of a positive time value of € 2 million and
 negative time value of € 5 million and,  in contrast to the table abovedoes not include the intrinsic value of the options. 
The fair value adjustments of outstanding cash flow hedges for
forecasted sales are reported in the income statement when the
forecasted sales transactions are recorded.  The vast majority of these
transactions are forecasted to occur in 2013.  As at December 31,  2012inventories were adjusted by positive € 16 million (2011: negative
€ 5 million) which will be recognised in the income statement in 2013. 
In the hedging reserve,  a negative amount of € 21 million (2011:
negative € 8 million) is included for hedging the currency risk of net
investments in foreign entities,  mainly for the Russian subsidiary LLC
'adidas,  Ltd. ".  This reserve will remain until the investment in the
foreign entity has been sold.  As at December 31,  2012,  no ineffective part
of the hedges was recorded in the income statement. 
In order to determine the fair values of its derivatives that are not
publicly traded,  the adidas Group uses generally accepted quantitative
financial models based on market conditions prevailing at the balance
sheet date. 
In 2012,  the fair values of the derivatives were determined applying
mainly the 'par method",  which uses actively traded forward rates.

Financial instruments for the hedging of interest rate risk
In 2011,  outstanding interest rate swaps in the nominal amount of
€ 105 million had a maturity of less than one year and were classified
as cash flow hedges pursuant to IAS 39 to protect future cash flows
arising from private placements with variable interest rates.  In 2011these interest rate swaps classified as cash flow hedges had a positive
fair value in the amount of € 0 million and a negative fair value of
€ 4 million.  The negative fair value change of € 0 million for interest rate
swaps which were classified as cash flow hedges was booked in hedging
reserves in 2011.  The amount that was reclassified from equity to the
income statement for the 2011 financial year was negative € 3 million. 
These cash flow hedges matured in 2012.  As at December 31,  2012,  no
further interest rate swaps were outstanding.

Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the realisation
of the related benefit is probable.  For the assessment of probabilityin addition to past performance and the respective prospects for the
foreseeable future,  appropriate tax structuring measures are also taken
into consideration. 
Deferred tax assets for which the realisation of the related tax benefits
is not probable increased on a currency-neutral basis from € 398 million
(restated) to € 508 million for the year ending December 31,  2012.  These
amounts mainly relate to tax losses carried forward and unused foreign
tax credits of the US tax group and tax losses carried forward of the
Indian subsidiaries.  The remaining unrecognised deferred tax assets
relate to subsidiaries operating in markets where the realisation of the
related tax benefit is not considered probable. 
The Group does not recognise deferred tax liabilities for unremitted
earnings of non-German subsidiaries to the extent that they are
expected to be permanently invested in international operations.  These
earnings,  the amount of which cannot be practicably computed,  could
become subject to additional tax if they were remitted as dividends or if
the Group were to sell its shareholdings in the subsidiaries.

accordance with the definition of IFRS 8 'Operating Segments",  six
operating segments have been identified: Wholesale,  Retail,  TaylorMadeadidas Golf,  Rockport,  Reebok-CCM Hockey and Other Centrally
Managed Brands.  According to the criteria of IFRS 8 for reportable
segments,  the business segments Wholesale and Retail are reported
separately,  while the remaining are aggregated under Other Businesses
due to their only subordinate materiality. 
The Wholesale segment comprises all business activities relating to
the distribution of adidas and Reebok products to retail customers. 
The Retail segment comprises all business activities relating to the
sale of adidas and Reebok products directly to end consumers through
own retail and own e-commerce platforms. 
The operating segment TaylorMade-adidas Golf comprises the
brands TaylorMade,  adidas Golf,  Adams Golf and Ashworth. 
The Other Centrally Managed Brands segment primarily includes
the business activities of the labels Y-3,  Porsche Design Sport and
adidas SLVR as well as the business activities of the brand Five Ten in the
outdoor action sports sector.  Furthermore,  the segment also comprises
the German own-retail activities of the adidas NEO label. 
Certain centralised Group functions do not meet the definition
of IFRS 8 for a reportable operating segment.  This includes functions
such as central treasury,  global sourcing as well as other headquarter

departments.  Assets,  liabilities,  income and expenses relating to these
corporate functions are presented together with other non-allocable
items and intersegment eliminations in the reconciliations. 
The chief operating decision maker for the adidas Group has been
defined as the joint Executive Board of adidas AG. 
There are no intersegment sales between the reportable segments. 
Accounting and valuation policies applied for reporting segmental
information are the same as those used for the adidas Group  /  
see
Note 02. 
The results of the operating segments are reported in the line item
"Segmental operating profit".  This is defined as gross profit minus costs
directly attributable to the segment or the group of segments (primarily
sales and logistics costs) before marketing working budget expenditures
and operating overhead costs not directly attributable. 
Segmental assets include accounts receivable as well as inventories. 
Only these items are reported to the chief operating decision maker on
 regular basis.  Depreciation,  amortisation,  impairment losses (except
for goodwill) and reversals of impairment losses as well as capital
expenditures for tangible and intangible assets are part of the segmental
reporting,  even though segmental assets do not contain tangible and
intangible assets.  Depreciation and amortisation as well as impairment
losses and reversals of impairment losses not directly attributable to a
segment or a group of segments are presented under HQ/Consolidation
in the reconciliations. 
Segmental liabilities only contain accounts payable from operating
activities as there are no other liability items reported regularly to the
chief operating decision maker. 
Interest income and interest expenses as well as income taxes are
not allocated to the reportable segments and are not reported separately
to the chief operating decision maker.

to spending for property,  plant and equipment such as investments in
the furnishing and fitting of stores in the Retail segment,  in new office
buildings and IT systems as well as the acquisition of Adams Golf. 
Cash inflows from financing activities were mainly related to proceeds
from the issue of a convertible bond in an amount of € 496 million.
