Interview with the CEO

Interview with the CEO  ›

013

2006 was a truly exciting year for the adidas Group.  With the acquisition of Reebok,  the Group broke
through the € 10 billion sales mark for the first time.  During the year,  the adidas brand captured the	
world's attention with its dominant presence at the 2006 FIFA  World Cup™.  Significant progress was
made at fully integrating the Reebok brands and organization.  The Group continued to improve operational ­ efficiency and financial strength and delivered 26% earnings growth.  In the following interviewH
­ erbert Hainer,  adidas Group Chairman and CEO,  reviews 2006,  and discusses the Group's strategic and
financial outlook. 

Herbert,  2006 was a big year for the Group. 
What were the stand-out moments and events
of the year?

2006 was without a doubt the most exciting year in my tenure as CEO of the adidas Group.  We chose the
name 'setting the pace" for this annual report,  because that's exactly what I believe we did in 2006 and by
the way what I challenge my Group to keep doing every day. 
In February,  we welcomed Reebok into the adidas family,  adding a powerful new dimension to our Group. 
Integration and change management quickly became two of our highest day-to-day priorities.  Although
there are still many challenges,  we made important strides in putting the right people and processes in
place to ensure we maximize the long-term opportunities this milestone acquisition presents.  While all
this was going on,  adidas reigned supreme at the 2006 FIFA World Cup™ during the summer taking product,  communication and execution to new levels.  And let's not forget TaylorMade-adidas Golf,  which also
delivered industry-leading top-line results and gained market share in several categories.  Financially,  toothe year was a record one with sales surpassing € 10 billion for the first time and net earnings growing an
outstanding 26%,  which would have been even higher excluding negative accounting impacts from the firsttime inclusion of Reebok. 

The 2006 World Cup left a huge impression with
millions of people around the globe.  What was its
impact on the Group?

In every respect,  this World Cup was a tremendous success for fans,  for Germany,  and for adidas.  We
clearly scored with consumers,  breaking sales records for footballs,  boots and national team replica products.  There were more players in the tournament wearing adidas footwear than any other brand.  And our
brand communication made a step change,  with spectacular onsite advertising.  Independent research confirmed that adidas was the hands-down winner in brand recognition among the 15 official partners,  and our
major competitors.  All of this meant that we were able to extend our market-leading position in the world's
favorite sports category,  growing football sales by more than 30% to over € 12 billion. 

014  Annual Report 2006  ›  adidas Group  ›

And the success reverberated throughout our organization.  Our sales momentum continued,  and in some
regions even accelerated,  well after the event.  I am really proud of these results,  and they serve as an inspiration and a reminder to all of us of what we can achieve with the proper focus,  dedication and hard work.  We
have raised the bar at managing these types of events,  and we will lift our game to achieve new heights with
the UEFA EURO 2008™,  2008 Beijing Olympics and the FIFA World Cup 2010™ all on the horizon. 

Your multi-brand approach is unique to the
industry.  What advantages do you see
from this strategy and what role does Reebok
play in driving its success?

 multi-brand strategy is not a new concept for the adidas Group.  We have more experience than anyone
else in the sporting goods industry when it comes to utilizing different brands to attack different market
segments.  And now with the Reebok acquisition,  we have taken this strategy to the next level.  We know that
there is also a limit to how far a single brand can be stretched in a particular product category,  segment or
demographic.  Brand management is our core competency and we believe that with a small number of topnotch brands,  we can mean more to more consumers.  And in the long term,  this is what market leadership
is all about. 
Within our Group,  adidas is recognized as the altruistic,  premium performance brand with a strong emphasis on team sports.  Reebok will be positioned within our portfolio to appeal to consumers who define sport
outside traditional convention,  prioritizing comfort and fit and celebrating individuality in sport and life. 
­Reebok will be our brand that focuses on breaking the barrier of combining sport and lifestyle,  with extensive crossover ­collections that utilize the brand's unique positioning with both women and American sports. 
And ­ TaylorMade-adidas Golf will continue to dictate the pace of innovation in the golf industry with the
power of the TaylorMade and Maxfli brands in golf equipment complemented by the strength of adidas Golf
in soft goods. 

There is a lot of attention being focused
on Reebok's current trading.  What are you doing
to reinvigorate the brand?

My vision for Reebok is simple and no different than my vision for our other brands: make the brand desirable,  with a clear focus on performance.  Reinvigorating the Reebok brand will not be an overnight process
and it will take several seasons before we really have the brand firing on all cylinders.  There are short-term
challenges which are compounded by difficult conditions in Reebok's core markets.  These and negative
accounting impacts were the reason why Reebok was not earnings accretive in the first year,  despite the
underlying profitability of the business.  We have told you that we will make investments to address these
issues and to provide additional support to strengthen the brand over the coming quarters. 

Interview with the CEO  ›

015

Our first big product initiatives will hit the market in the second half of 2007.  Here our focus will be on runningwomen's and apparel.  We are launching two new marketing campaigns,  'Run Easy" and 'Best On  Best Off"and will leverage our strong portfolio of partnership assets such as NFL,  MLB,  Peyton Manning,  Thierry
Henry and Scarlett Johansson to deliver the Reebok proposition to the consumer.  At the same time,  we are
also refining our distribution strategy at Reebok to ensure we are where it matters most to our consumers. 
By broadening our presence in all major retail formats,  particularly in sporting goods and better department
stores,  we will reduce the brand's historic dependence on specific customers and channels to provide a
more balanced and flexible distribution base.  We will also create new excitement with Reebok-CCM Hockey
and Rockport.  These two tremendous businesses are performing well and by leveraging the capabilities of
the entire ­adidas Group,  we will open up new avenues and opportunities for growth. 

You once again delivered significant growth in
North America in 2006.  What are your expectations
for 2007 and beyond?

In North America,  both adidas and TaylorMade-adidas Golf delivered excellent double-digit growth for the
second year in a row.  Reebok had a more difficult time with lower consumer appetite for classics productand intensified competition in the family footwear segment where the brand has been traditionally overr
­ epresented.  During the second half of 2006,  the market environment became more difficult and less transparent.  And it's clear that in 2007 market conditions will be more challenging for all of our brands in the ­
region.  Nevertheless,  I am confident our Group has the tools in place to be successful in this important
market.  We have worked hard in recent years to broaden our product offering and enlarge our distribution
base,  and we have clear potential to significantly improve the position of all our brands.  Growing our business profitably is our guiding principle in this market.  At adidas,  although our backlog development is negative in footwear,  we are seeing positive sell-through at the retail level,  particularly in running,  which leaves
us confident we will grow sales again in 2007.  Reebok meanwhile should benefit from new product and
campaign initiatives in the second half of 2007. 

016  Annual Report 2006  ›  adidas Group  ›

What about TaylorMade-adidas Golf?
What are the opportunities and challenges
for this business segment in 2007?

Our innovative strengths in this segment have allowed us to grow and increase market share in an otherwise
challenging space.  2007 will be an exciting year for the golf industry,  with several new technologies from
many market players.  And I'm very confident that TaylorMade-adidas Golf will again be at the forefront when
it comes to bringing stimulating,  technologically advanced product to the consumer.  Look at our two new
drivers,  the r7® SuperQuad and the Burner® driver,  which have been the two most played new clubs among
professionals on the PGA Tour since we launched them in January.  To fully capitalize on the momentumwe've also introduced a major marketing campaign supporting these product launches.  We are not only
scoring in the critical metalwoods category,  but also expect to generate strong growth with our golf balls as
well as our apparel and footwear offering.  We are gaining market share in many categories and I am fully
convinced that our team at TaylorMade-adidas Golf will deliver € 1 billion in sales in 2010. 

Over the last year,  you announced several
new retail initiatives.  Why are you
placing so much emphasis on this area
of your business?

The most successful companies are those that operate close to the market.  But,  for us,  close is not enough. 
We want to be closest.  At adidas,  our own-retail activities are setting the pace in providing the best consumer
experience,  with creative new formats and interactive fitting technologies.  But it is important to remember
that 85% of our product is presented to the consumer through our extensive distribution and retail partner
base.  Going forward,  a clear priority is collaborating even more with our partners to enhance every point-ofsale experience.  We want to get closer to the consumer in these channels,  but also to open up new opportunities and help increase the efficiency and profitability of our retail partners.  We are definitely leading the
industry here.  Whether it be shop-in-shop initiatives,  for example with JJB in the UK and Dick's Sporting
Goods in the USA,  or partnership agreements like those we have with INTERSPORT in Europe,  our goal is to
increase our impact at retail. 
And we won't stop there.  In order to be closest to every consumer,  we will raise the game of our entire organization.  In particular,  through our 'World Class Supply Chain" initiative,  we will enhance our supply chain
capabilities.  We will focus on speed,  agility and connectivity.  This includes building capabilities to share sellthrough data from our customers directly with our suppliers.  Our efforts will make us more demand-driven
and increase our retail and consumer focus.  In the end,  when consumers enter a store whether it be our
own stores,  our retail partners,  or online shopping they should always be able to find the product they want
in the color they want and the size they need.

How do you see 2007 shaping up from
 financial point of view?

In 2007,  I am confident we will build on the successes of 2006 and make further important strides towards
achieving our goals.  Despite less favorable retail conditions in North America and a more selective approach
to distribution in key European markets,  robust growth in emerging markets will drive a mid-single-digit
top-line increase for the year.  Gross margin will expand strongly as a result of improvements at all brandsthe realization of synergies and the absence of negative accounting effects.  We will invest a major portion
of these gains to strengthen our organization,  accelerate brand building at Reebok and continue own-retail
expansion.  Through the growth of our underlying business and disciplined balance sheet management,  we
will grow earnings at a rate approaching 15%. 

Looking further out,  what are the biggest
opportunities you intend to seize going forward?

 am excited by the challenges but most importantly the opportunities for our Group in the next three to five
years.  There is a clear momentum building at all brands that will become more visible in the second half of
2007 and beyond.  As an industry leader in the emerging markets,  we have a solid platform to exploit the vast
growth potential these markets have to offer.  Our sponsorship of the 2008 Beijing Olympics will be just one
example of how we will take these markets by storm.  The Reebok revitalization will gain momentum with
each new season of improved product,  brand communication and distribution.  We will achieve our integration targets of € 500 million in revenue and € 175 million in cost synergies by 2009.  The Group is moving
in the right direction and I am confident we can deliver on our medium-term guidance.  But this is just the
start,  as far as I am concerned.  With all our brands at the top of their game,  we will be a formidable force in
shaping the future of our industry. 

Thank you for this interview,  Herbert.

Supervisory 	
Board ­Report 
Dear Shareholders2006 was another very important year for the adidas Group.  The acquisition of Reebok International Ltd.  (USA) brought together
two of the most respected and well-known companies in the global sporting goods industry.  This helped the Group to expand
both its product portfolio and its geographic reach,  achieve a more balanced sales profile and extend research and development competencies.  The success achieved in 2006 represents a challenge as well as a motivation to continue implementing the
Group's strategic goals going forward. 
Cooperation between Supervisory and Executive Boards
In the year under review,  we,  as the Supervisory Board,  carefully and regularly monitored the Group's management and advised
the Executive Board on matters relating to the strategic development of the Group as well as major individual activities.  To
this end,  the Executive Board informed us regularly,  extensively and in a timely manner at the Supervisory Board meetings as
well as by verbal and written reports.  This information covered the Group's corporate policy,  business and financial positionprofitability,  and business planning,  including finance,  investment and personnel planning as well as all major decisions and
transactions.  We were involved in all decisions of fundamental importance at an early stage.  We held four Supervisory Board
meetings in 2006.  The attendance rate at these meetings was 100% with the exception of one meeting,  which one Supervisory
Board member was unable to attend due to urgent business commitments elsewhere.  In addition,  we passed additional resolutions on urgent matters by way of circular vote.  The external auditor KPMG Deutsche Treuhand-Gesellschaft Aktiengesellschaft
Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft,  Frankfurt am Main (KPMG) attended all meetings.  Furthermore,  as Chairman of the Supervisory Board,  I also maintained regular contact with the Executive Board.  We exchanged information and opinions,  between
the Supervisory Board meetings,  and I was kept thoroughly informed about the current business situation and major business
transactions. 
Main Topics Covered and Examined by the Supervisory Board
The positive development of sales and earnings as well as the financial position of the Group and the development of the individual segments was presented in detail by the Executive Board and subsequently discussed at all meetings.  Furthermoreitems on the agenda included numerous specific topics which were discussed with the Executive Board.  At the Supervisory
Board meeting on March 1,  2006,  we reviewed the adidas AG annual financial statements,  the consolidated financial statements
and the respective management reports for the year ending December 31,  2005,  as certified by the auditor,  and the proposal put
forward by the Executive Board regarding the appropriation of retained earnings.  Additionally,  we discussed the resolutions to
be proposed to the 2006 Annual General Meeting,  in particular the share split in a ratio of 1: 4 and the change of the company
name from adidas-Salomon AG to adidas AG.  Further,  the Executive Board reported to us on the current status of the Reebok
integration as well as on various capital increase measures planned at several subsidiaries in connection with the financing of
the Reebok acquisition,  which we resolved upon following an in-depth discussion. 
At our meeting on May 10,  2006,  we dealt with the first quarter 2006 financial results as presented by the Executive Board. 
In addition,  the Executive Board provided us with detailed information on the continuing progress and results achieved in the
expeditious integration of Reebok into the adidas Group. 
At our Supervisory Board Meeting on August 8,  2006,  our discussions focused on the half year financial report and the anticipated development of business for the remainder of 2006.  We also discussed in detail the strategic and financial aspects of
the planned divestiture of the Greg Norman Collection wholesale business.  In order to follow the project in a focused mannerwe established an ad hoc 'Greg Norman" Supervisory Board committee,  comprising an equal number of representatives of
the shareholders and the employees,  to which we transferred powers of authorization with respect to the potential divestiture
within a predefined negotiating framework.  A further agenda item of this meeting was information concerning the appointment
of KPMG as auditor of the financial statements of adidas AG and the consolidated financial statements for 2006 as well as a
review of the audit points and priorities agreed between the Audit Committee and KPMG. 

Supervisory Board Report  ›

The main focus of our Supervisory Board meeting on November 8,  2006 was a review of the Executive Board report with regard
to business development in the first nine months as well as approval of the budget and investment plan for 2007.  The Executive
Board presented the plan with detailed documentation supporting continued achievement of sustained growth at all brands. 
We indicated our agreement with the budget and investment plan.  At the same time,  we asked the Executive Board to again
consider the inclusion of additional investment in the Reebok brand for advertising,  product development and growth initiatives
in 2007,  which we believe is critical from a medium- and long-term planning point of view.  After the Executive Board decided to
implement a corresponding catalog of measures for 2007,  the Supervisory Board approved the budget and investment plan. 
Report from the Committees
In the year under review,  the Supervisory Board had four standing committees and one ad hoc committee which prepared
Supervisory Board resolutions and other extensive topics to be dealt with by the Supervisory Board as a whole.  In a few individual cases,  as far as permissible by law,  we delegated decision-making powers to these committees.  The composition of the
individual committees and the respective responsibilities are described in the Supervisory Board overview (see Supervisory
Board,  p.  23). 
»  The Steering Committee,  which is authorized to pass resolutions on behalf of the Supervisory Board in special urgent casesmet once in the year under review and resolved upon various capital measures to be undertaken by January 31,  2006 in the
context of the acquisition of Reebok International Ltd.  (USA). 
»  The General Committee met four times in the year under review.  The subject of the resolutions passed at the meetings and
by means of circular vote included the structure and amount of Executive Board compensation,  the dissolution and conclusion
of consultancy agreements with Supervisory Board members and the transfer of the adidas AG pension obligations towards
Executive Board members to an external pension fund. 
»  The Audit Committee met three times in the year under review.  The members discussed in detail the financial statements
of adidas AG and the consolidated financial statements for 2005 and dealt intensively with the half year and nine months
results.  A further matter for the Audit Committee was the thorough preparation of the Supervisory Board proposal concerning the appointment of the auditor to be presented to the Annual General Meeting.  In 2006,  the Audit Committee also spent
considerable time on the preparation of the opening balance sheet of Reebok and the change-over of the individual balance
sheets,  previously prepared in accordance with US-GAAP,  to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as well as
the required adjustments in this context.  Furthermore,  the members reviewed in detail the scope and intensity of the audits
of Group companies as well as the priority focal points for the audits.  At each of the Audit Committee meetings,  the Executive Board informed committee members in detail regarding the current status of the integration of the Reebok segment.  The
external auditor attended all three Audit Committee meetings and reported to the committee members in detail on its auditing
activities and results. 
»  The ad hoc 'Greg Norman" Committee,  to which the Supervisory Board had delegated powers of formal authorization

­ ollowing approval in principle of the project 'Divestiture of the Greg Norman Collection Wholesale Business",  dealt with the
financial and strategic aspects of the divestiture.  The committee approved the divestiture on October 19,  2006. 
»  The Mediation Committee again had no reason to meet in the year under review. 
The chairmen of the committees always reported to us in detail about the committees' work and meetings,  ensuring complete
exchange of information and good cooperation between the committees and the Supervisory Board as a whole.

Declaration of Compliance Underpins Good Corporate Governance
We report on corporate governance at adidas AG together with the Executive Board in the Corporate Governance report in
the annual report.  On February 16,  2007,  the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board presented an updated Declaration
of Compliance in accordance with § 161 AktG (German Stock Corporation Act),  which was made permanently available to the
shareholders of adidas AG on the corporate website on the same day. 
Detailed Examination and Discussion of the 2006 Financial Statements and Consolidated Financial Statements
KPMG audited the 2006 financial statements and management report of adidas AG prepared in accordance with the requirements of the German Commercial Code (HGB) and issued an unqualified opinion thereon.  The auditor also approved without
qualification the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with § 315a HGB in compliance with IFRS and supplemented by a Group Management Report. 
The financial statements,  the proposal put forward by the Executive Board regarding the appropriation of retained earnings and
the auditor's reports were submitted to the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board in a timely manner.  They were ­examined
in detail first by the Audit Committee and subsequently at our annual financial statements meeting on March 6,  2007 and were
discussed in the presence of the auditor who reported on the material results of the audit and was available for questions and
the provision of supplementary information.  Having examined the financial statements of adidas AG,  the consolidated financial
statements and the management reports,  we came to the conclusion that there were no objections to be raised.  We therefore
approved the results of the audit,  following the recommendation of the Audit Committee,  and adopted the financial statements
prepared by the Executive Board at our financial statements meeting.  The financial statements of adidas AG were thus established.  Further,  we examined and approved the Executive Board's proposal regarding the appropriation of retained earnings. 
Explanations pursuant to § 289 section 4 and § 315 section 4 HGB
At our meeting on March 6,  2007,  we also dealt with the compulsory disclosures pursuant to § 289 section 4 and § 315 section 4
of the German Commercial Code (HGB) as well as the reporting in this regard.  We refer to the related explanations in the adidas
AG management report and in the Group Management Report (see Reporting Pursuant to § 315 Section 2 No.  4 and Section 4
HGB,  p.  114).  We have examined these disclosures and explanations,  which in our opinion are complete,  and have internalized
them accordingly. 
adidas Group Well Positioned for the Future
2006 was an exciting year for the adidas Group in which important,  forward-looking strategic decisions were made.  All financial
targets were achieved.  Despite the short-term challenges relating to the Reebok brand,  we are confident that the Group is well
positioned for continuing success. 
We appreciate the tremendous personal dedication,  the performance and the ongoing commitment of the Executive Board,  the
Management Boards of the Group companies,  the Works Council and all adidas Group employees.  We thank all of them for
their contributions.

Corporate Governance
Report
We are committed to the principles of good corporate governance and continually strive to strengthen and sustain
the trust that investors,  business partners,  employees and
the public have placed in us.  Accordingly,  our Executive and
Supervisory Boards regularly evaluate current national
and international standards in responsible,  transparent
and efficient company management with the objective of
enhancing corporate governance at the adidas Group and
creating sustainable value.  Important corporate governance activities in 2006 focused on the implementation of
our Code of Conduct,  the examination of the updated German Corporate Governance Code as well as on our successful efforts to increase Annual General Meeting ­attendance. 

Dual Board System: Executive and Supervisory Boards
As required by the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktien­
gesetz AktG),  adidas AG has a dual board system which
assigns management functions to the Executive Board and
control functions to the Supervisory Board.  These two boards
are strictly separated in terms of membership and competencies.  Our Executive Board is currently composed of four
members (see Executive Board,  p.  18).  Our 12-member Super­
visory Board comprises an equal number of shareholder and
employee representatives in accordance with the German
Co-Determination Act (Mitbestimmungsgesetz MitbestG)
(see Super­visory Board,  p.  23). 
Efficiency through Supervisory Board Committees
In order to perform its tasks in a most efficient manner,  our
Supervisory Board has formed expert committees,  whose
chairmen report to the entire Supervisory Board on a regular
basis. 
»  The Steering Committee,  which consists of the Super­
visory Board Chairman and his two deputies,  discusses major
issues,  prepares resolutions and is authorized in special
urgent cases to take resolutions in lieu of the Supervisory
Board. 
»  The co-determined General Committee with four members is responsible in particular for the preparation of Supervisory Board resolutions regarding the appointment of Executive Board members.  Further,  the General Committee decides
on the content of the related employment agreements as well
as the structure and level of Executive Board compensation. 
»  The co-determined Audit Committee,  which comprises
four members,  deals primarily with accounting and risk management issues.  It also assesses and monitors the auditor's
independence.  It determines audit priorities,  discusses the
quarterly results and prepares Supervisory Board resolutions
regarding the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements as well as the agreement with the
auditor. 
»  The four-member Mediation Committee,  formed in accordance with § 27 section 3 of the German Co-Determination Actis responsible for submitting a proposal to the Supervisory
Board regarding the appointment or dismissal of Executive
Board members if the two-thirds Supervisory Board majority
required for an appointment or dismissal is not achieved. 

»  In addition,  the co-determined 'Greg Norman" Committee was established ad hoc in 2006 with four members.  The
Supervisory Board delegated the authority to grant approval
and pass resolutions relating to the sale of the Greg Norman
Collection wholesale business to this committee. 
For a summary of the activities of the Supervisory Board and
its committees in 2006,  see Supervisory Board Report,  p.  20. 
For an overview of the individual Supervisory Board and committee members,  see Supervisory Board,  p.  23. 
Close Cooperation between Executive and 	
Supervisory Boards
Our Executive and Supervisory Boards cooperate closely with
each other and on a basis of mutual trust in the best interest
of the adidas Group.  Our Executive Board develops the Group's
strategic orientation,  and then coordinates it with the Supervisory Board and ensures its implementation.  The Executive
Board informs the Supervisory Board frequently,  expeditiously
and comprehensively on the Group's strategy,  planning,  business development and risk management.  In particular,  the
Chairmen of our Executive and Supervisory Boards maintain frequent contact.  For certain business transactions and
measures,  the Executive Board must obtain the Supervisory
Board's prior consent.  This includes,  for example,  engaging in
or giving up major fields of activity,  the acquisition or disposal
of substantial corporate holdings and the approval of the budget,  including the capital expenditure and financial plan.  For
particularly urgent matters,  the Supervisory Board may also
resolve on issues by way of a written circular vote.  The Rules
of Procedure of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board
can be viewed online at www, adidas-Group, com.

Corporate Governance Report  ›

Code of Conduct Implemented
Integrity is one of the core values of the adidas Group.  Accordingly,  all employees are expected to act with fairness and
responsibility as well as in compliance with the laws and
regulations while carrying out their tasks.  In order to maintain good corporate governance,  we therefore adopted a Code
of Conduct as part of our internal Global Policy Manual in

­ ctober 2006.  The Code of Conduct defines binding rules for
all employees with respect to legally compliant and ethical
behavior towards other employees,  business partners and
third parties,  for handling information (in particular insider
information) as well as for dealing with financial matters.  The
Compliance Program of adidas AG is regularly updated and
ensures that complaints and potential breaches of the Code
of Conduct are dealt with independently and objectively. 

Noticeable Increase in Annual General Meeting Attendance
We are committed to ensuring that our shareholders have the
opportunity to exercise the basic rights they are entitled to by
law at the Annual General Meeting.  The very diverse and international nature of adidas AG's shareholder structure combined with a 100% free float (see Our Share,  p.  34) represents
 challenge and requires special measures.  We therefore
welcomed the 2006 introduction of a record date in Germanywhich is already standard practice internationally.  Accordinglywe amended our 2006 Annual General Meeting invitation to
the extent that the applicable record date for registration and
verification of shareholders for attending the Annual General
Meeting is set at 21 days prior to the Annual General Meeting. 
It is therefore no longer necessary for shareholders to deposit
shares to participate in the Annual General Meeting and exercise their voting rights.  Additionally,  we conduct a proxy soli­
citation prior to the Annual General Meeting to ensure that
our shareholders are directly contacted and informed on the
exact deadlines,  registration requirements and possibilities
for exercising their voting rights.  Further,  we offer all shareholders who register for the Annual General Meeting the
possibility to have their voting rights represented by ­proxies
appointed by adidas AG.  This service can be requested in
writing or via the Internet until the end of the general debate. 
There is also comprehensive information in two languages
available on our website at www, adidas-Group, com/agmincluding a live webcast of the Annual General Meeting.  At
the Annual General Meeting on May 11,  2006,  our efforts
were rewarded with an attendance rate of over 39%,  which
has encouraged us to again utilize these measures for our
next Annual General Meeting,  which will take place on May
10,  2007 in Fürth (Bavaria),  Germany. 

Transparency Strengthens Trust
Active and open internal and external communication is a prerequisite for strengthening stakeholder trust in the ­ adidas
Group.  In accordance with the principles of fair disclosurewe make new important information available to institutional
investors,  private shareholders,  financial analysts,  employees and the public in a prompt and comprehensive manner. 
An important communication medium for this purpose is our
website www, adidas-Group, com.  With our financial reportsanalyst and press conferences,  ad hoc and press releases
as well as Annual General Meeting information,  all interested parties have the possibility to form an up-to-date and
authentic opinion about our Group.  A financial calendar with
all important events can be found on our website as well as
in our Quarterly and Annual Reports (see Financial Calendar
2007,  Outside Back Cover).

Information on Directors' Dealings and Share Ownership
According to § 15a of the German Securities Trading Act
(Wertpapierhandelsgesetz WpHG),  Executive and Supervisory Board members,  other key executives as well as persons in close relationship with them are required to disclose
the purchase or sale of adidas AG shares or related financial
instruments (Directors' Dealings).  In 2006,  we received and
published seven Directors' Dealings notifications relating to
adidas AG shares (ISIN DE0005003404) at www, adidas-Group. 
com/directorsdealings.  In 2006,  we received no notification
from our Executive and Supervisory Board members relating
to their ownership of adidas AG shares or financial instruments pursuant to Article 66 of the German Corporate Governance Code.  Further,  we received no notification in 2006
according to which the share ownership of individual Executive and Supervisory Board members reached,  exceeded or
fell below the applicable notification thresholds provided in
the German Securities Trading Act.

Corporate Governance Report  ›

Compliance with German Corporate Governance Code
Our Executive and Supervisory Boards were regularly
informed on the latest developments in corporate governance
and the current aspects of good company management by our

­ orporate Governance Officer.  After in-depth discussion of relevant matters,  the Executive and Supervisory Boards issued an
updated Declaration of Compliance in accordance with § 161
of the German Stock Corporation Act on ­ February 16,  2007according to which we comply with all new recommendations
introduced by the Government Commission in 2006.  We also
comply with the majority of the Code's non-binding suggestions.  A summary of the current Declaration of Compliance is
provided here,  the full text version is available on our website at
www, adidas-Group, com/corporategovernance together with
all past Declarations of Compliance. 
adidas AG has been and will continue to be in compliance with
all recommendations of the German Corporate Governance
Code dated June 12,  2006,  with the following exceptions:
»  The D&O liability insurance for our Executive and Supervisory Board members does not include a deductible as this
is not common practice outside Germany.  Furthermore,  we
believe that it is not appropriate for our Group's insurance
policy,  which covers a large number of high-level executives
in Germany and abroad,  to differentiate between Executive
and Supervisory Board members and other executives. 
»  The structure and level of the Executive Board compensation is reviewed and determined by the Supervisory Board's
General Committee instead of the entire Supervisory Board. 
The General Committee informs the Supervisory Board as
 whole on the respective results.  This system has proven

­ uccessful over time. 

»  Stock options granted to the Executive Board within the
scope of the Management Share Option Plan (MSOP) do
not provide a possibility of a retroactive limitation (cap) for
extraordinary,  unforeseen developments as all stock options
were granted before this Corporate Governance Code recommendation was introduced in May 2003.  However,  should we
decide to initiate a new stock option plan in the future,  we will
comply with this recommendation. 
»  Supervisory Board members are not subject to an age
limit as we believe that this would unnecessarily narrow the
rights of our shareholders and employees to elect their representatives to the Supervisory Board. 
»  Supervisory Board compensation does not include a
variable component linked to the Group's performance.  We
believe this is essential to ensure the independent supervision required.  Furthermore,  there is no additional compensation for membership in Supervisory Board committees.  We
are,  however,  planning a new compensation structure,  which
will incorporate the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code. 
»  Ownership of adidas AG shares or related financial instruments by Executive and Supervisory Board members is
reported if it reaches,  exceeds or falls below the applicable
notification thresholds provided in the German Securities
Trading Act and if adidas AG is notified of this fact.  Since German legislation has achieved increased transparency through
the revision of § 21 and § 25 of the German Securities Trading
Act,  we also regard these thresholds as appropriate and sufficient for adidas AG.

Compensation Report
In our Compensation Report,  we summarize the principles
relevant for determining the compensation of our Executive Board and outline the structure and level of Executive
and Supervisory Board compensation. 

Disclosure Complies with Legal Requirements
This report is based on the recommendations of the German
Corporate Governance Code.  In accordance with the requirements of German commercial law and the Act on the Disclosure of Executive Board Compensation (VorstOG),  this report
contains information that is an integral part of the Notes pursuant to § 314 German Commercial Code (HGB) and of the
Management Report pursuant to § 315 HGB (see Reporting
Pursuant to § 315 Section 2 No.  4 and Section 4 HGB,  p.  114). 
For this reason,  an additional description is not made in the
Notes and Management Report. 

Executive Board Compensation in 2006
Compensation Determined by General Committee
In accordance with its Rules of Procedure,  our Supervisory
Board has assigned matters relating to the structure and
adequacy of the level of Executive Board compensation to its
co-determined General Committee (see Supervisory Board
Report,  p.  20). 
Three Components of Compensation
In 2006,  the total compensation of the members of our Executive Board amounted to € 9416 million.  The structure of our
Executive Board's compensation is based on our Group's size
and global orientation as well as our financial and economic
position.  Criteria for determining adequacy of Executive Board
compensation include the responsibilities and contributions
of each Executive Board member,  his individual performance
as well as the performance of the entire Executive Board. 
Compensation is comprised of (i) a non-performance-related
component,  (ii) a performance-related component,  and (iii) a
share-based component:
»  The non-performance-related component includes a fixed
annual salary and fringe benefits.  These benefits comprise
essentially the use of a company car,  the payment of insurance premiums,  and,  in exceptional cases,  a tax equalization
amount paid to level different tax rates in the USA and Germany.  Our Executive Board members receive no additional
compensation for mandates held within the adidas Group.

Compensation Report  ›

»  The performance-related component,  which comprises
the largest portion of Executive Board compensation,  consists
of a Performance Bonus as well as a bonus paid on the basis
of the Long-Term Incentive Plan.  Both bonus systems are
designed to provide a direct incentive for our Executive Board
members to achieve defined targets and to support sustainable value-oriented management. 
  The amount of the Performance Bonus is linked to the fixed
› 
annual salary and depends on the individual performance of
the respective Executive Board member as well as on the
Group's results.  The Performance Bonus is payable at the
end of each year upon determination of target achievement. 
  The Long-Term Incentive Plan 2006/2008 (LTIP Bonus
› 
2006/2008) is the second component of Executive Board variable compensation.  Its payout depends upon the attainment
of certain cumulative earnings improvements (basis: income
before taxes IBT) during the three-year period from 2006 to
2008.  If targets are met,  payment is due following the adoption of the consolidated financial statements for the period
ending December 31,  2008. 
»  The share-based component is comprised of compensation through the Management Share Option Plan (MSOP)which is calculated on the basis of a performance discount
consisting of an absolute and a relative performance component.  Option rights,  which were issued in several tranches
under the share option plan adopted by the 1999 Annual General Meeting,  are exercisable over a period of five years following a two-year vesting period,  provided that at least one of
the two performance targets,  i, e.  absolute performance and
relative performance,  has been attained (see Note 33,  p.  178). 
Executive Board members were last granted options under
the Management Share Option Plan (MSOP) in August 2002. 
No new share option plan has been proposed to the Annual
General Meeting.

Number of Stock Options Outstanding Reduced
In 2006,  a total of 9100 options were exercised within the
scope of the Management Share Option Plan (MSOP) by the
current members of our Executive Board in the period ending
December 31,  2006.  Compensation resulting from the exercise of these options totaled € 603410.  As at December 312006,  our Executive Board members held 2800 stock optionswhich they have not exercised yet. 
Employment Contracts Provide for Severance Payments
The open-ended employment contracts of our Executive Board
members contain provisions governing severance payments
in the event that adidas AG terminates their employment
without cause.  Executive Board members Herbert HainerErich Stamminger and Glenn Bennett will each receive a severance payment totaling 100% of their annual fixed salaries at
the time of their departure.  Robin J.  Stalker's severance payment will amount to 50% of his annual fixed salary at the time
of his departure.  All severance payments are payable at the
time of the departure of the beneficiaries from the company. 
If an Executive Board member dies during his term of officehis spouse will receive a one-time payment amounting to 25%
of the annual fixed salary. 

Pension Commitments to Executive Board Members
Pension commitments include old-age pension,  disability
benefits as well as widow's pensions. 
»  Old-age pension: Pensions are paid to Executive Board
members for life as soon as they reach the age of 65 and
retire from adidas AG.  The pension allowance is based on a
percentage of the pensionable income currently equaling the
annual fixed salary.  Starting from a base amount totaling 10%
or 20% of the pensionable income,  the pension entitlement
increases by 2% for each full year of tenure as an Executive
Board member of adidas AG and can reach a maximum level
of 40% of pensionable income.  In the event of the retirement
of an Executive Board member prior to reaching the statutory
retirement age,  the non-forfeiture of the pension entitlement
will be in line with the provisions of the law.  The increase of
current pension payments or pension entitlements is indexlinked in accordance with German law. 
»  Disability benefits: Should Executive Board members
become incapacitated for work before they have reached
retirement age,  they are entitled to pension payments according to the same conditions stated above. 
»  Widow's pension: When an Executive Board member dieshis spouse receives a surviving annuity amounting to 50% of
the pension entitlements. 
Pension Fund Used to Cover Pension Entitlements
adidas AG has not created reserves pursuant to German

­ ommercial law for the pension entitlements acquired by
current Executive Board members as at December 31,  2006
since adidas AG was released therefrom following a payment
into a pension fund.  This payment,  equaling the present value
of future pension entitlements calculated as at December 312006,  is split among the individual Executive Board members
in relation to the former provisions for pension obligations. 
The pension fund complies with the requirements for plan
assets as defined in IAS 19 and is settled against the provisions for pension obligations.

Service Costs Key Parameter for Pension Provisions
Expenses for the current Executive Board members' pension scheme include basic service and interest costs.  Variable interest costs and income associated with plan assets
are subject to strong fluctuations.  As a result,  service cost is
used as a parameter comparable to the provisions for pension
obligations which the German Corporate Governance Code
requires companies to disclose. 
Pensions for Former Executive Board Members
Pension provisions for pension obligations relating to former Executive Board members amount to € 42105 million. 
In 2006,  former Executive Board members received pension
payments totaling € 1906 million. 
No Loans to Executive Board Members
No members of the Executive Board were granted loans in
2006. 

Supervisory Board Compensation in 2006
Compensation Defined in adidas AG Articles of Association
The compensation of our Supervisory Board members was
resolved upon by the Annual General Meeting on May 8,  2003and is contained in our Articles of Association.  Supervisory
Board compensation consists of a fixed annual payment
amounting to € 21000 for each member,  twice the amount
for the Chairman and one and a half times the amount for
each Deputy Chairman.  In addition,  all members receive
reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses associated with
Supervisory Board meetings. 
Compensation for Advisory and Service Contracts
At the end of 2006,  project-related fixed-term advisory contracts exist with two Supervisory Board members,  Henri Filho
and Dr.  Hans Friderichs. 
No Loans to Supervisory Board Members
No members of the Supervisory Board were granted loans in

Our Share
2006 was a difficult year for the adidas AG share,  in which
it was unable to continue the excellent performance it
delivered in 2005 and previous years.  Concerns surrounding Reebok's short-term business outlook and the state of
the North American sporting goods industry burdened our
share especially in the second half of the year and could
not be offset by the continued strong operational performance of the adidas and TaylorMade brands. 

adidas AG Share Unable to Match Strong 2005 Performance
After having significantly outperformed the DAX-30 and the
MSCI World Textiles,  Apparel & Luxury Goods Index in 2005the adidas AG share could not sustain this positive momentum in 2006 and decreased 6% over the course of the year.  Our
share thus underperformed the DAX-30 and the MSCI World
Textiles,  Apparel & Luxury Goods Index which increased 22%
and 24%,  respectively.  The increase of the DAX-30 was driven
by strong company earnings,  buoyant mergers and acquisitions activity as well as the improving macroeconomic
environment.  The MSCI Index gained on the back of strong
company earnings throughout the sector.  The positive development was only interrupted in May and June,  when a strong
rise in commodity prices and fears of a sharp economic downturn in North America resulted in significant losses of the
DAX-30 as well as other global indices.  However,  worries
about inflation and inherent interest rate hikes abated quickly. 
The stock markets in the rest of Europe,  the USA and Japan
also increased over the year,  albeit to a lesser extent. 
adidas AG Share Member of Important Indices
The adidas AG share is included in a variety of high-quality
indices around the world,  most importantly the DAX-30,  Germany's premiere stock index,  and the MSCI World TextilesApparel & Luxury Goods Index,  which comprises the Group's
major competitors.  At December 31,  2006,  our weighting in
the DAX-30,  which is calculated on the basis of free float market capitalization and 12-month stock market turnover,  was
112% (2005: 139%).  Our reduced weighting compared to the
prior year is a consequence of a decrease in market capitalization that could not be offset by a strong increase in share
turnover.  Adjusted to reflect our share split,  average daily
trading volume of the adidas AG share excluding bank trades
rose from almost 17 million in 2005 to more than 20 million in 2006,  highlighting the increased interest in our Group. 
Within the DAX-30,  we ranked 24 on market capitalization
(2005: 18) and 21 on turnover (2005: 21) at year-end 2006.

Our Share  ›

Share Split and Name Change Effective in June
Since June 6,  2006,  our shares have traded under the new
company name 'adidas AG",  which was changed from
'­adidas-Salomon AG" as a result of the divestiture of the

­ alomon segment in the fourth quarter of 2005.  On the same
day,  a share split in a ratio of 1: 4 became effective (see
Note 22,  p.  165).  The split was conducted to enhance the
liquidity of our share especially among private investors and
had no dilutive effect as no new capital was raised.

adidas AG Share Price Under Pressure
After a strong start in January,  when our share reached its
year-high of € 4400,  the share price declined in February and
early March as a result of concerns regarding Reebok's shortterm business outlook.  Analyst reports commenting positively
on the future of the combined Group after our annual Investor
Day led to a recovery that continued until May.  After a strong
increase on the day of the announcement of our first quarter
earnings,  our share price subsequently declined strongly in
line with the overall market.  Despite adidas' successful sponsoring activities around the 2006 FIFA World Cup™,  our share
continued to lack momentum after the event due to fears of
 slowdown of the North American sporting goods market. 
Positive impulses from our well-received half year results at
the beginning of August only temporarily supported our share. 
Starting at the end of August,  however,  our share price rallied
in anticipation of an upswing at Reebok ahead of the adidas
Group's third quarter earnings announcement.  Management
reported strong results of the adidas and TaylorMade-adidas
Golf segments but also announced additional investments into
the Reebok segment to accelerate the brand's revitalizationresulting in a reduction of the Group's net income guidance
for 2007.  As a consequence,  the adidas share lost significantly
on the day of the announcement and underperformed thereafter to finish the year at € 3773.  Compared to the prior yearour market capitalization decreased to € 77 billion at the end
of 2006 versus € 81 billion at the end of 2005.

Strong Increase in Number of ADRs Outstanding
Our Level 1 American Depositary Receipt (ADR) facility
launched on December 30,  2004,  continues to enjoy great
popularity among American investors.  During the course of
2006,  the number of Level 1 ADRs outstanding has grown
significantly from approximately 16 million to 113 million at
year-end 2006.  This strong increase reflects the increased
interest of US-based investors in our share.  Adjusted for the
share split which was also applied to our ADRs,  the Level 1
ADR closed the year at US $ 2520,  representing an increase
of 66% versus the prior year (2005: US $ 2364).  Due to the
appreciating euro,  the ADR outperformed our common
stock. 
Convertible Bond Trades at a Premium
In 2006,  the adidas Group further diversified sources of financing.  As part of the financing of the Reebok acquisition,  the
Group issued several additional private placements in 2006
(see Treasury,  p.  85).  The publicly traded convertible bond
closed the year at € 15490,  which is 41% lower compared to
the end of the prior year (2005: € 16160).  It ­currently trades at
 premium of around 52% above par value of the share. 
Higher Dividend Proposed
The adidas AG Executive and Supervisory Boards will recommend paying a dividend of € 042 to our shareholders at
the Annual General Meeting on May 10,  2007.  Subject to the
meeting's approval,  the dividend will be paid on May 11,  2007. 
The proposed dividend per share represents an increase of
€ 0095 per share (2005: € 0325),  showing our confidence in
the Group's future business performance.  The total payout of
€ 85 million (2005: € 66 million) reflects a payout ratio of 18%
(2005: 17%).  The dividend proposal follows our dividend policy,  under which the adidas Group intends to pay out between
15 and 25% of consolidated net income.

2006 AGM Renews Authorization for Share Buyback
In addition to ratifying the actions of the Executive and Supervisory Boards in 2005 and resolving upon the dividend,  the
name change and the share split (see above),  the Annual General Meeting also approved a change in adidas AG's Articles of
Association to reflect changes in German company law regulating the convocation of and the requirements for attending a
general meeting.  Following the capital increase in November
2005,  which utilized all outstanding authorized capital,  new
authorized capital amounting to € 20 million was approved. 
In addition,  the Annual General Meeting renewed the existing authorization to repurchase own shares up to an amount
totaling 10% of the stock capital until November 10,  2007 (see
Reporting Pursuant to § 315 Section 2 No.  4 and Section 4
HGB,  p.  114).  Currently,  however,  the Group has no concrete
plans to make use of this authorization. 
Investor Base in North America Significantly Strengthened
Based on the amount of invitations to our Annual General
Meeting in May 2006,  we estimate that we currently have
around 85000 shareholders.  According to our latest ownership analysis conducted in February 2007,  known institutional
investors now account for approximately 96% (2006: 93%) of
our shares outstanding.  As a result of the Reebok acquisition
and our stronger position in the North American market,  institutional shareholdings in this region increased significantly to
37% (2006: 29%).  German institutional investors accounted
for 12% of adidas AG shares (2006: 13%).  The shareholdings in the rest of Europe excluding Germany decreased to
40% (2006: 44%).  2% are held by institutional shareholders in
other regions of the world (2006: 3%).  The adidas Group management,  which comprises current members of the Executive
and Supervisory Boards,  continues to hold less than 5% in
total.  Smaller,  undisclosed holdings,  which also include private investors,  declined to 4% (2006: 7%).

Strong Analyst Interest Continues
The adidas Group continued to receive strong interest from
analysts and investors in 2006.  Around 30 analysts regularly
published research reports on adidas AG.  The majority of
investors and analysts remain confident about the mediumand long-term potential of our Group,  although the recommendation split as of December 31,  2006,  reflects several
downgrades due to concerns about Reebok's short-term
business outlook and the reduction of the Group's 2007 net
income guidance on November 9.  38% of analysts recommended investors to 'buy" our share in their last publication
during the 12-month period (2005: 75%).  56% advised to hold
our share (2005: 25%).  6% issued a 'sell" rating (2005: 0%). 
Award-Winning Investor Relations Activities
adidas AG strives to maintain continuous close contact to institutional and private shareholders and analysts.  In 2006,  management and the Investor Relations team spent almost twenty
days on roadshows and presented at numerous national and
international conferences (see www, adidas-Group, com/investors for a detailed calendar of events).  In April 2006,  we invited
the financial community to our seventh annual Investor Day in
London,  where Management presented the Group's strategy
and future brand positioning.  The effectiveness of our Group's
Investor Relations activities was highlighted by the Institutional
Investor Magazine,  whose surveys among buy-side and sellside analysts again ranked us as the best Investor Relations
program in our sector.  In addition,  we took second place in the
DAX-30 in the annual Investor Relations rankings conducted
by German business magazine Capital. 
Extensive Financial Information Available Online
At www, adidas-Group, com/investors,  we offer extensive information around our share as well as the Group's strategy
and financial results.  Our event calendar lists all conferences
we attend and provides all the presentations for download. 
In addition to live webcasts of all major events such as our

­ nalyst Conference,  the Annual General Meeting and our
Investor Day,  we have started to offer podcasts of our quarterly
conference calls.  In 2007,  we will further improve our website
to best meet the information needs of our stakeholders.

Extending Innovation and Design Leadership
At the adidas Group,  we are dedicated to continuously developing and commercializing industry-leading technologies
and designs.  Innovation plays a significant role in differentiating our product offering from competitors and helping us to
deliver on core strategies.  One of our important growth drivers in recent years has been the Group's ability to consistently
bring major innovations to the market,  creating new exciting
products,  superior functionality and attractive designs.  We are
committed to launching at least one major new technology or
technological evolution per year.  By harnessing the extensive
R&D expertise within our Group,  we will continue our wideranging efforts to generate both trade and consumer interest (see Research & Development,  p.  69).  This will allow us
to introduce new products at high price points,  positively
impacting the Group's margins.  Strategic partnerships with
Stella McCartney,  Yohji Yamamoto,  Scarlett Johansson,  Polar
and Porsche Design are examples of our efforts to widen our
design and innovation reach and imbue our products with the
excitement consumers demand.

Financial Performance Drives Shareholder Value
Sustainable revenue and operating profit growth are critical to
our success (see Internal Group Management System,  p.  48). 
At all our brands we will pursue the most value-enhancing
avenues for growth,  with particular emphasis on bringing the
Reebok brand in line with the Group's profitability standards. 
In addition,  rigorously managing working capital and optimizing financial leverage through debt reduction continue to be
priorities for us.  Creating value for our shareholders through
significant free cash flow generation drives our overall

­ ecision-making process.  At the same time,  we remain committed to increasing returns to shareholders through above
industry average share price performance and dividends.

Internal Group
Management System
The adidas Group's central planning and controlling system
is designed to continually increase the value of our Group
and brands to maximize shareholder value.  By improving our top- and bottom-line performance and optimizing
the use of our capital employed,  we aim to maximize free
cash flow generation,  which is our principal financial goal. 
Management utilizes a variety of decision-making tools to
assess our current performance and to align future strategic and investment decisions to exploit commercial and
organizational opportunities. 

Group Management Report  ›

Free Cash Flow as Internal Group Management Focus
The cornerstone of our Group's Internal Management System is our focus on free cash flow generation,  which is an
important contributor to driving increases in shareholder
value.  Free cash flow is comprised of operating components
(operating profit,  change in operating working capital and
capital expenditures) as well as non-operating components
such as financial expenses and taxes.  To maximize free cash
flow from our operating activities,  we strive to increase Group
sales but also the Group's gross and operating margins.  To
implement this principle across our multi-brand organization,  brand management has direct responsibility for improving operating profit and the management of operating working capital and capital expenditure.  Non-operating items
such as financial expenses and taxes are managed centrally
by the Group Treasury and Tax departments.  To keep Group
and brand management focused on ongoing performance
improvement,  variable compensation of the responsible managers is linked to both operating profit and operating working
capital development. 
Sales and Gross Margin Development Important
Performance Drivers
An essential element of our future operating performance is
maintaining and developing our strong top line.  To achieve
this,  Management focuses on identifying and exploiting opportunities that not only enhance growth,  but also have
potential to increase gross margin (defined as gross profit as
 percentage of net sales) at the same time.  Major levers for
gross margin improvement are ongoing improvements of the
Group's product mix,  the expansion of our high-margin ownretail activities as well as the optimization of the geographic
mix of our business.  In addition,  the minimization of clearance activities and ongoing supply chain efficiency gains,  are
drivers for gross margin improvements of our Group.

Operating Margin as Key Performance Indicator of
Operational Progress
Operating margin (defined as operating profit as a percentage of net sales) is our Group's most important measure of
operational success as it combines the quality of our top-line
development with our ability to drive efficiencies through our
business.  The primary drivers enhancing the Group's operating margin are continued gross margin improvements and
operating expense control.  Operating expense control is particularly important as we strive to leverage the Group's growth
through to the bottom line.  To control operating expensesManagement has set clear guidelines for both variable and
fixed cost pillars.  We plan our marketing working budget as a
percentage of targeted sales each year and constantly monitor
deviations.  Over the last few years,  our efforts have focused
on optimizing the split between communication (including advertising,  retail presentation and public relations) and
promotional expenditure.  By concentrating on well-selected
premium partnerships with top events,  associations,  leaguesclubs and athletes,  we have been able to reduce the Group's
relative promotion spend.  As a result,  we are improving the
balance between promotional and brand communication
within the marketing working budget.  We also aim to reduce
operating overhead expenses as a percentage of sales by
continuously improving internal processes through efficiency
programs in our sales,  distribution,  finance,  IT and other general administration functions.

Tight Operating Working Capital Management
Due to a comparatively low level of fixed assets required in
our business,  operating working capital management is a
major focus of our efforts to improve the efficiency of the
Group's balance sheet.  We have made major strides in this
area through tight working capital management focused on
continuously improving our Group's inventories,  accounts
receivable and accounts payable.  Our key metric is operating
working capital as a percentage of net sales.  Monitoring the
development of this key metric facilitates the measurement
of our progress in improving the efficiency of our business
cycle.  Inventory levels and ageing are controlled to ensure
fast replenishment and to keep our product offering current. 
Accounts receivable are managed by continuously improving
collection efforts to reduce Days of Sales Outstanding (DSO). 
Likewise,  we strive to optimize payment terms with our suppliers to best manage our accounts payable. 
Capital Expenditure Targeted to Maximize Future Returns
Improving the effectiveness of the Group's capital expenditure
is another lever to maximize the Group's free cash flow.  Planning and control are of particular importance as we strive to
select capital projects that enable our Group to meet targeted
commercial and operational goals.  We limit capital expenditure levels through disciplined budget monitoring and focused
expenditure on our core strategies.  Our capital expenditure is
controlled with a top-down,  bottom-up approach.  We evaluate potential return on planned investments utilizing the net
present value or internal rate of return method,  in relation to
the cost of capital.  Specific investments are assessed according to the principles of risk-weighted returns. 

050  Annual Report 2006  ›  adidas Group  ›

M&A Activities Focus on Long-Term Value Creation Potential
We expect the majority of our Group's medium-and long-term
growth to come from organic business.  However,  as part of
our commitment to ensuring sustainable profitable development,  as appropriate we also review external merger and
acquisition options that may provide additional commercial
and operational opportunities.  Acquisitive growth focus is primarily in two key areas: regional expansion and/or strengthening our Group's positioning within a sports category.  The
strategies of any potential acquisition candidate must correspond with the Group's long-term direction.  We also scrutinize key financial metrics that must support value accretion. 
Aligning the cost of capital to return on invested capital is a
core consideration in our decision-making process.  We also
evaluate the potential impact on our free cash flow,  assessing
the contribution potential from the target and any potential
financing implications. 

Group Management Report  ›

Optimization of Non-Operating Components
Our Group also puts a high priority on the optimization of
non-operating components such as financial expenses and
taxes as these items strongly impact the Group's bottom-line
development and therefore the Group's free cash flow.  Financial expenses are managed centrally by our Group ­Treasury
department (see Treasury,  p.  85).  The Group's current and
future cash outflow for taxes is optimized globally by our
Group Taxes department. 
Cost of Capital Key Metric to Measure Investment Potential
Creating value for our shareholders by earning a return on
invested capital above the costs of that capital is a guiding
principle of our Group strategy.  We source our capital from
the equity and debt markets; therefore we have a responsibility that our return on that capital meets the expectations of
both equity shareholders and creditors.  The adidas Group calculates the cost of capital according to the debt/equity ratioutilizing a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) formula. 
We then use this metric to calculate the required financial
returns of planned capital investments.  The cost of equity is
computed utilizing the risk-free rate,  market risk premium
and beta.  The basis for the derivation of the cost of debt is the
risk-free rate,  credit spread and average tax rate. 

›  Structure and Strategy 
Structured Performance Measurement System
Our Group has established a far-reaching performance measurement system utilizing a variety of measurement tools. 
To measure the Group's current sales and profitability development,  we monitor our annual budget on a monthly basisaddressing shortfalls and identifying additional opportunities for our Group.  Further,  we monitor operating margin
developments at all brands on a monthly basis.  If deviations
between actual and target numbers arise,  we perform a
detailed ­analysis to identify and address the cause.  In addition,  we benchmark the Group and brand results with those of
our major competitors on a quarterly basis.  We measure the
Group's future development of the top line utilizing our order
backlog development which comprises the orders received
within a period of six to nine months in advance of the actual
sale and represents approximately 70% of future anticipated
revenues.  Also increasingly important is the monitoring of
our own-retail activities and at-once business,  which is not
included in the order book.  We provide updates on these
developments as part of our quarterly reports (see Subsequent Events and Outlook,  p.  106). 

adidas Group  ›

Management Appraisal of 2006 Performance and
2007 Targets
We communicate our Group's operational performance and
targets for the coming year externally on an annual basis and
provide updates as appropriate throughout the year to ensure
optimal transparency.  In 2006,  we achieved all key financial
targets within the focus of our Internal Management System. 
We outperformed industry and economic growth in all regionsincreased our earnings at a double-digit rate,  and made progress on debt reduction during the year (see Group Business
Performance,  p.  72).  For 2007 and beyond,  we again strive to
optimize our Group's free cash flow development.  We believe
the current trading environment supports our expectations
given positive growth projections for our industry and the
global economy.  Further,  we believe our targets are realistic
within the scope of the current trading environment,  and no
material event between the end of 2006 and the publication of
this report has altered our view (see Subsequent Events and
Outlook,  p.  106).

adidas has a clear mission 'to be the leading sports brand
in the world".  To accomplish this mission,  the organization at adidas is segmented to meet the needs of distinct
groups of sport-oriented consumers.  Our product and
marketing initiatives primarily focus on key global sports
categories and on the sports lifestyle market.  The adidas
brand attitude 'Impossible is Nothing" drives all our brand
communication initiatives and helps us strengthen the
adidas brand's bond with the consumer.  With our broad but
selective distribution approach and our pricing strategy,  we
clearly position adidas as a premium brand in all markets. 

Group Management Report  ›

adidas Sport Performance: Focus on Sport and Athletes
No other brand has a more distinguished history or stronger
connection with sport than adidas.  Sport is the foundation for
all three adidas divisions and will be at the core of the adidas
brand in the future.  Therefore,  adidas Sport Performance will
remain our primary focus both in terms of product and brand
initiatives and will continue to generate at least 70% of adidas
brand revenues in the medium and long term.  Although the
adidas Sport Performance division offers product in almost
every sports category,  our key priorities are the running,  football,  basketball and training apparel categories.  In all these
areas,  we strive to be the leading global brand.  Therefore,  we
aim to consistently present the adidas attitude 'Impossible
is Nothing" in a relevant way to our consumers.  Our 'Impossible is Nothing" brand campaign encourages consumers to
achieve their own personal impossible goal no matter what
it might be. 
Running: Becoming the Brand of Choice for Runners
Running will be our top priority in 2007 and is critical to our
success moving forward.  We strive to make adidas the leading
running brand worldwide and our target is to be the brand of
choice for runners on all levels,  from competitive runners to
recreational and fitness runners.  Therefore,  we are increasing our efforts to offer the best performance running products in the industry.  For adidas to become the leading and
most inspirational running brand,  we will support our product
initiatives partnering with running retailers providing them
in-store-service and technical support.  Further,  we intend
to leverage our partnerships with selected global marathon
events (e.g.  Boston,  London and Berlin Marathons) and highlight running as a key category in our 'Impossible is Nothing"
brand communication initiatives. 

›  Structure and Strategy 
Football: Further Strengthening Leadership Position
Football has always been one of our key strengths at adidas. 
For over 50 years,  adidas has led all major developments
in football boot technology and balls.  And the name adidas
has become synonymous with the passion of how football is
played,  shared,  enjoyed and celebrated.  This is why adidas is
the world's leading football brand in terms of market share as
well as in overall net sales.  By fully exploiting our role as Official Partner at the 2006 FIFA World Cup™,  which was played
in our home market Germany,  we exceeded all our branding and commercial goals and extended our global market
leadership in the football category.  Being the most popular
sport worldwide,  football is clearly one of our key strategic
priorities.  Therefore,  we strive to increase our leadership
position by continuously creating the industry's top products
and fully leveraging our outstanding portfolio of promotion
partners.  The latter comprises leading football associations
(e.g.  FIFA,  UEFA),  national federations (e.g.  Germany,  FranceSpain,  Argentina,  Japan),  leagues (e.g.  MLS),  clubs (e.g. 
Real Madrid,  AC Milan,  Chelsea FC,  Liverpool FC,  FC Bayern
Munich) and individual players (e.g.  David Beckham,  Michael
Ballack,  Kaká,  Lionel Messi). 

Brand Segments  ›

Basketball: Leveraging Our Partnership with the NBA
Increasing our presence in the basketball category represents another key component of our adidas brand strategy. 
We believe our success in this category is particularly dependent on our ability to develop and communicate the adidas
view of basketball as a team sport.  Our product and marketing initiatives therefore promote the importance of the team
as shown by our 'It Takes 5ive" basketball campaign launched
in 2006 (see Campaigns and Products,  p.  117).  In this context,  we see our new long-term partnership with the NBA as
 critical asset.  This partnership provides the adidas brand
with exclusive licensing rights to all NBA on-court and warmup apparel as well as NBA-branded footwear for all teams. 
­Additionally,  the partnership ensures adidas' visibility at all
2460 NBA games and allows us to effectively promote and
harness our outstanding roster of individual players including Tracy McGrady,  Kevin Garnett,  Gilbert Arenas,  Chauncey

­ illups and Tim Duncan.  Together with the NBA,  we will be
able to seize business opportunities in a creative and innovative way as we did,  for example,  with the successful introduction of an NBA-specific collection of our iconic Superstar
shoe featuring a version for each of the 30 NBA teams.  As the
NBA is well-known and highly popular around the globe,  the
partnership represents a vehicle to drive the adidas basketball business not only in North America but also in Europe
and particularly in Asia.  In China,  for example,  basketball
is the most popular sports with over 80 million active basketball players.  By leveraging our well-defined distribution
network in China,  we intend to exploit the untapped potential in the basketball category,  which will help us achieve our
long-term ambition of becoming the leading basketball brand
worldwide. 

»  adidas 
Training Apparel: Technology and Sport Fusion Drive Growth
Training apparel is another important category for the adidas
brand across our men's,  women's and kids' businesses. 
Clima,  our leading moisture management and temperature
control system,  continues to be a core platform for the category.  We are segmenting it further in 2007 to meet the growing consumer demand for functional,  performance collections
with products featuring ClimaCool®,  ClimaLite®,  ClimaProof®
and ClimaWarm® technology.  TechFit™,  led by innovations in
the emerging compression apparel market,  is another integrated concept that will be an important growth driver.  In
addition,  to meet consumer demand for comfortable,  stylish
and ­athletic leisurewear,  we are targeting significant growth
in 2007 through sport fusion concepts which translate sportsinspired lifestyle themes into style-relevant apparel. 
Women's: Increasing Our Connection with Consumers
Increasing our position in women's is another critical element
of the adidas brand strategy.  Over the last two years,  collections that have been designed and developed in collaboration
with fashion designer Stella McCartney have set industry
standards in combining performance and fashion features. 
This has helped us to increase the attractiveness,  relevance
and functionality of our products.  We have extended this

­ uccessful partnership until 2010 and we will further expand
our product offering in the women's segment with our new
­Adilibria and Fuse collections.

adidas Sport Heritage: Healthy Growth of Sports Lifestyle
The adidas Sport Heritage division has been a significant
growth driver over the last years and has made the adidas
brand a trendsetter in the market for the sports lifestyle consumer.  No other brand can draw upon such a strong history in
sports products that inspire the development of authentic and
contemporary lifestyle and street wear products of the future. 
'Celebrate Originality" is our key message to address the
sports lifestyle consumer and all our product and marketing
messages are built around this idea.  To ensure future sales
growth and continued leadership in the sports lifestyle market,  we will continue to broaden our product offering into new
areas and at the same time strengthen our key concepts such
as the legendary Superstar shoe.  Our 'Freizeit" and 'Sleek"
collections,  which we will launch in 2007,  clearly highlight
this approach (see Campaigns and Products,  p.  117).  We also
intend to further capitalize on our successful partnership with
Missy Elliott.  As part of this partnership,  we launched a signature collection called 'Respect M. E. " that generated strong
sell-through in 2006.  To prevent dilution of the adidas brand
as a result of oversupplying the market,  we will continue our
selective distribution strategy,  which will also help us retain
the high gross margins we generate with our product offering
in this division.  In the medium to long term,  we intend to produce up to 30% of adidas brand revenues in this division.

adidas Sport Style: Expanding the Power of the Brand
The adidas Sport Style division is entering its fifth year in
2007.  At adidas,  we know that niche marketing is increasingly important and that successful brands are those which
can reach not only larger audiences but also small and influential ones.  Our Y-3 collection,  developed with designer Yohji
Yamamoto,  is helping us extend our product appeal to cosmopolitan consumers who are looking for exclusive,  styleleading active sportswear products.  The collection is limited
to fashion-oriented accounts in Europe,  North America and
Asia.  Influential designs combined with the highest quality
standards clearly distinguish Y-3 from any other product in
the market.  With Y-3,  the adidas brand has distinctly established itself as a design leader in the industry.  Yamamoto's
strong presence in this area allows us to expand the power of
the adidas brand to help reach out to style setters and fashion industry visionaries.  We extended the collaboration with
Yohji Yamamoto until 2010 to influence the sports and fashion
industry through innovative design and intriguing ideas and
concepts going forward.  However,  Sport Style will remain a
small part of the overall adidas business going forward as we
intend to generate around 1% of adidas brand revenues in this
division. 
Distribution: Focus on Wholesale and Own-Retail Business
At adidas,  our product distribution follows a two-fold
approach.  We generate around 85% of adidas brand revenues
through our wholesale business,  where our own sales subsidiaries sell our footwear,  apparel and hardware/accessories to retail partners.  Additionally,  we run adidas own-retail
stores,  where we sell our products directly to consumers.  Our
own-retail business accounts for close to 15% of adidas brand
revenues. 

Group Management Report  ›

Wholesale: Building a Broad Platform
At the core of our wholesale strategy is the idea that we want
 mutually beneficial relationship with our retailers.  Our goal
is to be a valuable and reliable business partner to them.  We
work closely with regional and local key accounts,  often providing them with exclusive product or marketing concepts
as well as shop-in-shop initiatives.  We strive to avoid over­
exposure to any particular customer,  by broadening our presence across all distribution channels (see Risk Report,  p.  96). 
In general,  our customers include sporting goods,  athletic
specialty and family footwear retailers as well as high-end
department stores and directional accounts in the Sport Heritage division.  To preserve the premium image of the adidas
brand,  we generally do not sell our products to value or discount chains.  Our customer base varies by region and country.  In China,  for example,  retailers typically operate so-called
mono-branded stores,  which generally carry only one brand. 
As opposed to our own retail activities,  these mono-branded
stores are owned and run by external partners (2006: around
3000 stores). 

›  Structure and Strategy 
Own Retail: Important Pillar of adidas Business
Own retail consists of four major components: concept storesfactory outlets,  internet sales and concession corners in Asian
markets.  Concept stores market Sport Performance and/or
Sport Heritage products directly to consumers in a standalone retail environment and provide us with high visibility in
major metropolitan locations as well as growth opportunities
in Eastern Europe and Asia where less retail infrastructure is
available.  Factory outlet stores are also stand-alone concepts
used to optimize clearance activities for the adidas brand. 
Concession corners provide adidas sales infrastructure to
emerging markets in Asia.  Internet sales,  which are increasingly important in North America,  are available at the Group's
www, adidas, com website.  Our own-retail activities give us
valuable insight into consumer trends and product positioning.  We share this insight with our retail customers,  who also
often benefit from being in proximity to our concept stores. 
Going forward,  we will continue to expand our adidas ownretail activities worldwide.  Our own-retail expansion,  however,  will remain opportunity-driven,  i, e.  new store openings
depend on the availability of the right location.  In the medium
to long term,  we plan our own-retail business to account for
15 to 20% of adidas brand sales and we want to grow overproportionately in categories and markets that support this aim. 
Pricing Strategy: Driving Premium Price Points
We offer the vast majority of our footwear,  apparel and hardware products at high- and mid-level price points.  Our goal is
to strengthen both our brand's market position and revenues
by driving continuous growth in average selling prices and
increasing profitability.  In case of strong promotional activities at retail,  we proactively take steps to protect the image
of the adidas brand (see Risk Report,  p.  96),  and are prepared
to give up short-term revenue opportunities as necessary to
preserve our long-term market position. 

Brand Segments  ›

Reebok
At Reebok,  our mission is to 'always challenge and lead
through creativity".  Our product designs and marketing
programs display the brand's commitment to creativity and
to constantly challenge the status quo.  At the core of the
Reebok brand is the affirmation of the uniqueness of all
people.  Our strategic focus to become a consumer-driven
brand reflects this emphasis on individuality.  Through our
brand positioning (Celebrate Individuality in Sport and
Life),  we empower individual achievement by supporting
athletes and consumers to realize their unique dreams and
goals.  To best address distinct consumer groups and to balance our business,  we have segmented Reebok into three
brand units: Reebok,  Reebok-CCM Hockey and Rockport.

'I AM WHAT I AM" Articulates Brand Positioning
'I AM WHAT I AM" expresses our attitude at Reebok.  It is an
emotional call to action and a celebration of the ­consumer's
individuality,  courage and accomplishments.  Reebok launched
'I AM WHAT I AM" in 2005 as a multi-faceted fully-integrated
global marketing campaign and ever since then it has driven
all product and marketing initiatives.  Going forward,  we will
continue to build the Reebok brand under the umbrella of
'I AM WHAT I AM" and it will be the core of all our marketing
concepts and campaigns.

Increasing Sports Credibility
One of the key strategic priorities at Reebok is to strengthen
and extend the positioning as a credible sports brand,  building upon the brand's history in sport and fitness.  At Reebokwe emphasize fit and comfort in all our products to meet
the individual needs of athletes.  We have identified runningsports licensing,  basketball and football as our key categories
to expand our global presence in sport.  In addition,  we consider the women's segment as a major opportunity. 
Running: Focus on New Runners
Running represents the biggest global opportunity for us to
build our sports credibility.  Our approach is to appeal to runners with comfort,  fit and cushioning in their running footwear.  While our products are targeted to all runners,  our
primary focus is on new runners,  empowering them to enjoy
the fun,  camaraderie and joy of running.  Our most important
running technologies are KFS,  The Pump™ and DMX.  And
from 2007 onwards,  we will offer fully comprehensive running
ranges including footwear,  apparel and hardware to showcase Reebok as a 360 degree running brand.  We support our
product initiatives with dynamic marketing concepts leveraging our partnerships with athletes.  In 2007,  for example,  we
will address our target consumers with our 'Run Easy" running campaign (see Campaigns and Products,  p.  117).

Sports Licensing: Continued Growth in American Sports
Being the only major brand that has official partnerships
with the NFL,  the NHL and MLB,  Reebok has a unique positioning in sports licensing and American sports.  We are the
only brand offering footwear products with team logos of all
these three major American sports leagues.  Our role as Official Outfitter of the NFL and as exclusive licensee of the NHL
enables us to significantly increase our sports credibility in
our biggest market for the Reebok brand and to capitalize on
revenue opportunities in the licensed apparel category.  The
strong position in North America also represents the ideal
basis to build a global platform in sports licensing.  By leveraging our partnerships with outstanding athletes such as
Peyton Manning,  Vince Young or Sidney Crosby through marketing campaigns,  we will further reinforce our brand image
among consumers and retailers.  We will continue to aggressively and strategically market our partnerships to drive sales
growth in sports licensing but also supplement our licensed
apparel and footwear offering with performance gear for
the respective sport.  In hockey,  for example,  we support our
licensed apparel range with Rbk or CCM branded equipmentfully capitalizing on the market leadership of Reebok-CCM
Hockey. 

Group Management Report  ›

Regional Initiatives Strengthen Sports Positioning
The basketball and football categories also play key roles in
extending our sports positioning.  While our initiatives in both
of these sports will be regional in nature,  improving our market position in basketball and football will help us strengthen
our global brand presence.  By driving our Pump™ custom fit
footwear technology and further utilizing our partnerships
with individual players such as Allan Iverson and Gerald
Green,  we expect to grow in the basketball category in North
America going forward.  Our partnership with Yao Ming can
help us to drive our basketball business in China.  In footballour intention is to position Reebok as a credible niche player
and to strengthen the brand's sports positioning particularly
in Europe.  Our partnerships with well-known footballers
such as Thierry Henry and Andriy Shevchenko will enable us
to offer signature products that fit their individual styles and
personalities. 
Branded Apparel: Redefining the Category
We consider branded apparel as the most important global
growth opportunity for the Reebok brand.  To realize this
opportunity,  we intend to build a world-class cross-divisional
global apparel organization.  This group will utilize the proven
capabilities and the infrastructure of adidas,  particularly in
the areas of sourcing and supply chain excellence.  We are
revamping product design and development processesadopting adidas best practices where possible.  In additionwe are building a strong apparel technology platform including,  for example,  our successful 'Play Dry" concept.  By creating global ranges that include region-specific executions and
focusing on the unique fit of our products,  we aim to position the Reebok brand as a credible and competitive market
player in the branded apparel category. 

›  Structure and Strategy 
Women's: Delivering the Perfect Fit
The women's segment has always been one of the key
strengths of the Reebok brand.  To further extend our leading position in this important segment,  we will continue to
strengthen our profile as the brand delivering the perfect fit
for women.  Our goal is to offer innovative women's footwearapparel and accessories across our sports and lifestyle categories.  Our goal is to enable women to express their individuality.  Through fashionable and at the same time functional
products,  emotional marketing concepts and partnerships
with top athletes (e.g.  Amélie Mauresmo,  Carolina KlüftNicole Vaidisova) and other celebrities (e.g.  Scarlett Johansson) we will show that Reebok is the brand that fully understands the needs of the female consumer.

Selective Approach to Solidify Leadership in Lifestyle
Despite our initiatives to reinforce our sports credibility and
increase our sports-related business,  catering to sports lifestyle consumers continues to be an important pillar of our
brand strategy at Reebok.  Over the last years,  we established
our brand as a major competitor in the global sports lifestyle
market.  In particular,  we built our brand's connection with
urban consumers by,  for example,  introducing music-related
footwear products with entertainers such as Jay-Z and
50 Cent.  To position Reebok as a sports and lifestyle brandwe will continue to offer fashion-oriented sports-inspired
products.  However,  we are taking a selective approach to
ensure that we maximize credibility in sport by limiting exposure to the sports lifestyle market.  We will continue to partner
with entertainers,  actors and artists to appeal to a variety of
consumers and to stress individuality in our product offering
combining elements of sport,  entertainment and fitness.  This
will also be reflected in our marketing concepts,  such as our
'Best On  Best Off" campaign. 

» Reebok 
Rockport: Casual Lifestyle Market Focus
The Rockport brand represents another vehicle for us to
tackle the global lifestyle market.  At Rockport,  we strive to
be a leading global,  casual lifestyle brand that delivers real
and tangible differences that better the consumer's experience through style and technology.  To fully address consumer
needs in the casual lifestyle market,  our product offering
comprises dress casual,  casual and outdoor footwear as
well as apparel and accessories with a focus on functionality
and style.  We will continue to convert Rockport from being
 brand whose business is heavily weighted towards North
America and which particularly targets mature male consumers to a global,  style-oriented brand targeting younger male
and female consumers.  Our marketing concepts will concentrate on driving the brand's perception in consumers' minds
as a leader in functionality and style.  We strive to expand our
global market position by leveraging our heritage as the first
brown shoe brand to incorporate comfort technology coupled
with a significant technical advantage over the competition. 
Balancing Global Wholesale Distribution
To reduce overexposure to certain retail channels (e.g.  ­athletic
specialty,  family footwear),  we are refining our distribution
strategy at Reebok.  As part of our efforts,  we are broadening our presence in all major retail formats (athletic specialtysporting goods,  family footwear,  and department stores) to
get a more balanced product distribution and to reduce the
dependence on a particular channel or customer.  At Reebokwe utilize our own-retail network primarily to best manage
our clearance activities.  As a result,  we generate the vast
majority of revenues through our wholesale business.  On a
global basis,  we are buying back distribution rights for the
Reebok brand in Europe and Asia to increase control of our
brand and drive revenue growth in these regions.  We will utilize Reebok's expanding infrastructure but also leverage the
existing adidas sales platform. 

057

Refined Pricing Policy to Drive up Average Selling Prices
To reinforce Reebok's position as a premium sports and lifestyle brand,  we intend to significantly improve and increase
our product offering at high- and mid-price points to drive
growth in average selling prices.  Although this approach may
slow our top-line development in the short term,  we believe
it enables us to build a platform for future sales and profitability growth.  As a result of our new pricing strategy,  there
will be a certain level of competition between the adidas and
Reebok brands,  particularly at mid-level price points.  To prevent cannibalization,  we will clearly differentiate both brands
by communicating distinct brand messages targeted at different consumer types.

adidas Golf: Technology-Infused Golf Apparel and Footwear
adidas Golf is the fastest-growing footwear and apparel
brand in golf,  as a result of our steady commitment to developing great-looking,  great-feeling,  performance-enhancing
products.  In the golf footwear market,  we have established
adidas Golf as an industry leader by introducing stylish highperformance products such as the award-winning Tour 360
golf shoe.  With the introduction of the adidas ClimaCool®Clima Compression and ClimaProof® technologies in golf
apparel,  we have positioned adidas Golf as the most innovative performance apparel brand in the golf market.  Through
our unique approach to golf footwear and apparel,  we target
active,  serious,  athletically inclined golfers who understand
that the right technologies can dramatically improve the performance of footwear and apparel.  Therefore,  it remains our
key priority to sustain adidas Golf's position as a serious yet
stylish performance footwear and apparel brand by continuously incorporating industry-leading design and technology
into our products.  Our partnerships with professionals such
as Sergio Garcia,  Jim Furyk,  Tom Lehman and Natalie Gulbis
combined with our marketing campaign 'Equipment for Your

Maxfli: Value Orientation in Golf Ball Category
During the last year,  we have repositioned Maxfli as a topvalue golf ball brand.  Maxfli creates and offers technologically
advanced performance-oriented golf balls at great value.  With
the Maxfli brand we primarily target value-minded golfers who
covet long distance and want to feel different,  not following
the mainstream but making their own choices.  To effectively
present our new positioning,  we entered into a partnership
with John Daly in 2006,  one of the most popular and recognizable golfers in the world who resonates well with a broad
cross-section of consumers.  Being a fun-loving player with a
passion of hitting the ball hard,  an approach to golf that we
call 'Long Ball Rebel",  Daly perfectly personifies the ­ Maxfli
brand.  Going forward,  our focus at Maxfli will be to drive the
positioning as a performance brand creating and offering
balls that provide excellent speed,  distance and feel.

Brand-Specific Wholesale Distribution
Due to their different product offering,  all brands at
TaylorMade-adidas Golf follow a different distribution strategy.  At the TaylorMade brand,  we focus on retail partners
that can effectively showcase the performance advantages of
TaylorMade products.  Therefore,  our core channels include
off-course golf specialty retailers,  green grass retailers
and sporting goods retail formats with golf-specific departments.  In line with our brand positioning,  our key distribution
channels for adidas Golf footwear and apparel are primarily
green grass retailers but increasingly also general sporting
goods retailers that generally carry a significant portion of
softgoods.  In addition,  we leverage the existing adidas ownretail network.  To fully capture Maxfli's potential in the value
segment,  we distribute our products through all golf-related
retail formats. 
Pricing Strategy Reflects Brand Positioning
Our pricing policy mirrors the positioning of our brands in
the golf market.  To underline the premium positioning of the
TaylorMade brand,  our pricing strategy includes dominating
the market at top price points and competing aggressively in
the high-volume mid-price segment.  At adidas Golf,  to support our market perception as an innovative performance golf
footwear and apparel brand,  we primarily sell our products
at premium price points.  Maxfli targets the higher end of the
value segment,  offering technology-driven performance golf
balls at high-value price points.

Global Operations
The adidas Group's Global Operations function coordinates
the development,  commercialization,  manufacturing and
distribution of our products and leads the Group's efforts
in supply chain improvement.  Our products are almost
entirely manufactured by independent suppliers,  primarily
located in Asia.  Global Operations continually strives to
optimize our Group's supplier network to increase cost

­ fficiency throughout our supply chain and ensure consistently high product quality.  The integration of Reebok into
our supply chain will enable us to maximize buying power

Independent Manufacturers Produce adidas Group Products
Independent manufacturers produce nearly 100% of our
products.  We provide these suppliers with detailed specifications for production and delivery.  In 2006,  we worked
with 547 independent manufacturing partners (2005: 223
excluding Reebok).  This excludes local sourcing partners for
apparel,  subcontractors,  second tier suppliers and factories
of our licensees.  Of these suppliers,  66% were located in
Asia,  19% were located in Europe (incl.  Africa) and 15% in the
Americas.  39% of all Asian suppliers were located in China.  In
order to ensure the high quality that consumers expect from
our products,  we enforce strict quality control and inspection
procedures at our suppliers.  In addition,  we promote adherence to social and environmental standards throughout our

Asia Dominates Footwear Production
In 2006,  Asia continued to be our most significant sourcing
region for footwear.  97% of our total footwear volume for the
adidas and Reebok brands was produced in this region (2005:
95% excluding Reebok).  Production in Europe (incl.  Africa) and
the Americas represented 3% of our sourcing volume (2005:
5% excluding Reebok).  China represents our largest source
country with approximately 46% of the total volume followed
by Vietnam with 25% and Indonesia with 23%.  In 2006,  our
footwear suppliers produced 199 million pairs of adidas and
Reebok shoes,  up 62% from 123 million pairs in 2005 as a
result of the inclusion of Reebok and strong organic growth
at brand adidas.  Although supplier concentration visibly
increased in 2006 due to the acquisition of Reebok,  our largest footwear factory only produced approximately 11% of our
footwear sourcing volume for the adidas and Reebok brands. 
The Rockport brand,  which is not serviced by our Global
Operations function due to different sourcing requirements in
the brown shoe business,  has a separate operations team. 
Rockport sourced approximately 10 million pairs of footwear
in 2006,  primarily from China,  Indonesia and Vietnam. 

»  Global Operations 
Apparel Production Driven by Asia
Asia also represented the most significant portion of our
apparel source base with 76% of our total apparel volume
coming from the region in 2006 (2005: 78% excluding Reebok)followed by Europe (incl.  Africa) with 16% (2005: 16% excluding Reebok) and the Americas with 8% (2005: 6% excluding
Reebok).  China and Indonesia were the largest source countries,  representing 23% and 15% of total apparel productionrespectively.  In total,  our suppliers produced 230 million units
of apparel for all Group brands in 2006 (2005: 177 million
units excluding Reebok).  The largest apparel factory produced approximately 8% of our total apparel volume in 2006. 
The majority of Reebok apparel volumes were sourced at
our independent manufacturing partners through agents as
opposed to the direct sourcing which is common practice at
the adidas Group.  As part of the integration of Reebok into our
Group's supply chain,  we will build in-house sourcing capabilities while steadily reducing the number of agents involved
in the sourcing process. 
Brand-Specific Hardware Production
The bulk of adidas and Reebok branded hardware productssuch as balls and bags,  were produced in Asia,  representing
97% of the volume in 2006 (2005: 96% excluding Reebok). 
China remained our largest source country,  representing 61%
of hardware production,  followed by Vietnam with 19% and
Pakistan with 14%.  The remaining 6% was sourced via other
Asian and European countries.  The majority of our hardware
volume at TaylorMade and Reebok-CCM Hockey was also
produced in Asia.  In addition,  both brands sourced a small
portion of hardware products in the Americas and Europe. 
At TaylorMade,  the majority of golf club components were

­ anufactured in China and assembled by TaylorMade in the
USA,  China and Japan.

Reebok Integration Drives Cost Savings
The integration of Reebok has brought several benefits to
our supply chain.  Our integration efforts focus on maximizing our buying power,  consolidating global contracts with our
third party logistics providers and building in-house apparel
capabilities at Reebok.  In 2006,  we established a new Global
Logistics function to work across all brands as a single point
of contact for negotiating with global service providers.  One
example of this team's early success was achieving significant savings across our transportation contracts for 2006
and beyond.  With respect to buying power,  we initiated our
'World Class Buyer" program to maximize purchasing leverage across our brands.  Consolidating volume across our first
and second tier suppliers and adopting costing best practices
will be the two primary drivers of cost savings in our Global
Operations function going forward.  In apparel,  we will leverage adidas best practices and technologies to build in-house
development and sourcing capabilities for Reebok.  The business has so far been channeled through agents.  This change
will support Reebok apparel sales growth by ensuring more
reliable deliveries and consistent quality.

Strong Progress with 'World Class Supply Chain"
In 2005,  we started our 'World Class Supply Chain" initiative
to reengineer the way we do business at the adidas Group. 
Our goal is to be closer to the consumer than our competitors in order to optimize our product offering,  to best attack
market opportunities and to improve profitability.  Thereforewe want to increase speed and flexibility throughout our supply chain.  The essence of 'World Class Supply Chain" is to
move our business to five differentiated and dynamic business models targeting consumer needs.  This initiative covers the whole concept-to-shelf process (i, e.  all activities from
the first product sketch to the final delivery to retailers) and
encompasses marketing,  sales and operations functions.  In
2006,  we successfully introduced the Brand and Evergreen
models at brand adidas.  The Brand model is designed to
deliver our brand statement products with strong concepts. 
To drive brand image,  these important product initiatives are
supported by full-fledged customer service,  marketing,  retail
and supply chain capabilities.  Examples of such concepts are
adidas1 or Predator®.  The Evergreen model provides short
lead time and never-out-of-stock capabilities for our most
commercial long-lifecycle products such as basic apparel
lines.  Both business models have been implemented at brand
adidas in Europe,  the USA and Asia.  We expect to generate
20% of brand adidas revenues via the Brand and Evergreen
products in 2007 and these new business models show an
overproportionate sales growth potential going forward.  In
2007,  we will also launch the Quick Response and Global/
Regional models.  The Quick Response model will allow us to
seize additional market opportunities with a three-month or
six-month concept-to-shelf process and the Global/Regional
model will focus on creating regional adaptations of global
concepts to specifically address consumer needs in the
respective market.  We expect to implement a fifth model by
2008 and have the target to reduce the portion of our products
that we create,  manufacture and deliver on an 18-month cycle
to 25% by 2010 (today around 75%). 

Group Management Report  ›

Continued Optimization of Supplier Base
Strong supplier relationships remain a significant factor for
both the outcome of our Global Operations activities and the
Group's overall success.  We work closely with our suppliers
on key initiatives such as boosting efficiency,  enhancing management systems,  incorporating special handling programs
and supporting quick response fulfillment programs in order
to best serve our customers and capitalize on market opportunities.  To facilitate a close working relationship with our
suppliers,  we have cross-functional teams based on-site at
many factories.  We measure the Group's suppliers based on
quality and delivery performance criteria but also regularly
monitor their social and environmental compliance (see Sustainability,  p.  63).  We further assess our suppliers using more
subjective ratings such as customer satisfaction levels and
innovation.  Following the acquisition of Reebok,  consolidating
and optimizing our supplier base has become an even more
important part of our Global Operations function.  Our goal is
to further reduce and optimize the overall number of suppliers to drive additional cost savings and increase sourcing
efficiency.  Reducing the supplier number allows us to realize
scale benefits in purchasing and will help us increase consistency in product quality. 

›  Structure and Strategy 
EU Anti-Dumping Duties Have No Material Impact
As we consistently strive to optimize our Group's sourcing
structure,  we closely monitor the probability of the imposition of quotas,  tariffs and duties and proactively take measures to prevent significant financial impacts resulting from
those restrictions (see Risk Report,  p.  96).  On October 5,  2006the Council of the European Union imposed an anti-dumping
duty on imports into the EU of footwear with leather uppers
originating in China and Vietnam.  These anti-dumping measures will be applicable for two years.  Initial discussions
about potential anti-dumping duties indicated that approximately 20% of our Group's footwear volume would have been
impacted.  However,  we began sourcing these products from
Indonesia and Thailand early in 2006 because of the potential
imposition of import duties.  As a result,  when the legislation
became effective,  only limited fine-tuning of our source base
and product allocation was necessary to eliminate virtually all
negative impacts resulting from these duties.  Going forwardwe will continue to diversify our sourcing portfolio across
all product types to gradually reduce reliance on China-only
sourced product.  Our overall plan is to reduce the proportion
of sourcing volume in China by increasing capacities in other
countries such as Indonesia,  Vietnam and India.  In 2006,  we
introduced India as a new footwear sourcing country and will
gradually grow capacity there in the coming years.

Open Dialog and Interaction with Stakeholders
We actively and systematically engage with our numerous
stakeholders,  involving them in key social and environmental decisions that shape day-to-day operations.  In this waywe can balance interests,  build consensus and enhance the
transparency of our business.  We pursue a policy of open dialog with stakeholders debating issues and approaches andwhere appropriate,  forming partnerships to develop longterm solutions.  We continue to drive and comment on industry
best practice relating to stakeholders through our membership of organizations such as the World Business Council for
Sustainable Development,  Business for Social Responsibility,  the World Federation of the Sporting Goods Industry and
the Fair Labor Association.  This provides the Group with the
opportunity to work closely with top companies from various
sectors to develop sustainable business approaches and to
debate social and environmental topics on a global level.  The
adidas Group makes every effort to achieve open and transparent reporting.  Comprehensive information on the Group's
social and environmental programs is provided on our website under www, adidas-Group, com/sustainability. 
Merging Leading Programs
Both the adidas Group and Reebok have strong track records
in transparent reporting about social and environmental
performance and supporting third-party verification of our
programs.  With the acquisition of Reebok,  the Group's ambition is to combine the best of both programs in a new adidas
Group Social and Environmental Affairs (SEA) team.  During
2006,  we revised our social and environmental program to
incorporate new standards,  guidelines and procedures,  covering supplier guidance,  initial factory assessments and compliance monitoring.  Our assessments are now recorded in an
industry-wide data management system (Fair Factory Clearing House) that Reebok helped establish.  This facilitates the
exchange and increased transparency of compliance-related
information within our industry.  The outcome is a more robust
program that will deliver stronger results in improving social
and environmental conditions.

Setting Clear Standards
The adidas Group's Workplace Standards are based on the
International Labour Organization (ILO) and UN conventions
relating to human rights and employment practices,  and follow the World Federation of the Sporting Goods Industry's
model code of conduct.  Our Workplace Standards contain
clear rules of conduct regarding environmentally sound,  safe
and healthy working conditions,  fair wages and benefits,  freedom of association,  prohibition of excessive overtime,  forced
and child labor,  and protection against harassment and discrimination.  The Standards help us to select business partners that have workplace standards and business practices
consistent with our values and to reject those that do not.  As
guiding principles they also help identify potential problems
so that we can work with our business partners to address
issues of concern as they arise. 
Encouraging Self-Governance through Management Systems
Good management systems help factories improve their dayto-day operations and support the process of internalization
and self-governance.  Therefore,  we support our business
partners in pursuing the opportunity for certification with
internationally recognized standards such as ISO (International Standardization Organization) 9000 and 14001 for quality and environmental management and OHSAS (Occupational
Health and Safety Assessment Series) 18000.  By establishing
 certified management system,  our suppliers demonstrate
this commitment to continuously improve their performance. 
We help them build or improve human resources systems
at factories to maintain good working conditions,  including
factory grievance systems to routinely find and fix noncompliance problems.  Further,  we empower workers to protect their own rights and take an active role in decisions that
affect their lives.  In 2006,  there were 35 adidas Group footwear suppliers' factories worldwide certified in accordance
with OHSAS 18000,  ISO 14001 and/or the ISO 9000 series.

Achieving Sustainable Compliance with Tailored Training
Our practices are geared to encourage suppliers to take
responsibility for compliance themselves in the longer term. 
To achieve long-term sustainable compliance,  we consider
training even more important than monitoring and policing
factories.  Through training,  factory managers become better at communicating and creating the conditions for workers to openly express issues that need improving.  Thereforeour SEA team offers specific training courses for suppliers'
supervisors and managers to help them apply our Standards. 
Furthermore,  we promote the establishment of sustainable
structures that actively involve the workers and management of our suppliers,  local employee associations and nong
­ overnmental organizations.  In this way,  acceptable working
conditions become a routine part of business activities.  In
2006,  the SEA team conducted 173 (including Reebok) training sessions and workshops for suppliers,  workers and adidas
Group employees (2005: 225,  including Salomon excluding
Reebok).  The training activities took place in our suppliers'
factories,  in adidas Group offices and in regional workshops.

The SEA team assesses compliance with our Workplace Standards by means of factory inspections.  Team members also
act as change agents,  actively advising our business partners
how to correct any instances of non-compliance and how to
prevent future non-compliance.  Our SEA team collaborates
closely with other Group and brand functions such as Global
Operations,  Marketing,  Product Development and Human
Resources.  It is directly involved in developing and updating
corporate policies and operating procedures related to social
accountability,  product safety and compliance with environmental laws and regulations.  Our team members are represented locally in close proximity to supplier factories in AsiaEurope,  Middle East,  Africa and the Americas.  During 20061101 factory visits (including Reebok) involving management
and worker interviews,  document review,  facility inspections
and trainings,  were conducted at different levels in our supply
chain (2005: more than 680 visits,  including Salomon excluding Reebok). 

›  Structure and Strategy 
External Independent Monitoring and Verification
In addition to the monitoring work of our SEA team,  we value
independent assessment by third parties to demonstrate the
credibility of our internal program.  In 1999,  we joined the Fair
Labor Association (FLA),  a non-profit multi-stakeholder coalition of private corporations,  non-governmental organizations
and universities.  As a member,  the adidas Group is subject to
external assessment by independent monitors,  participation
in the FLA third-party complaint system and public reporting. 
The organization publishes an annual report that includes a
transparent evaluation system for the results of participating companies.  Following an extensive review of the Group's
compliance program,  the FLA accredited the monitoring
program of the adidas Group excluding Reebok in May 2005. 
Reebok became the first company to receive this FLA designation when its footwear compliance program was accredited
in April 2004.  In June 2005,  Reebok's apparel compliance program was also accredited by the FLA.  The programs apply for
re-accreditation every two years.  Therefore,  Reebok's footwear compliance program was re-accredited in October 2006. 
Since joining the FLA,  more than 200 Independent External
Monitoring (IEM) audits and verification visits were conducted
at adidas and Reebok suppliers. 
Termination of Business Relationship as Last Resort
We work in partnership with our suppliers and give them
guidance and training where necessary to analyze the underlying causes of non-compliance and to implement corrective
measures.  In case of continuous non-compliance with the
Workplace Standards,  we see termination of the business
relationship as a last resort because,  whenever possible,  we
prefer to stay in partnership and to work from the inside to
help encourage factory improvements.

Reebok Consolidation Drives Employee Growth
At December 31,  2006,  the Group employed 26376 peoplewhich represents an increase of 66% versus the previous
year's level of 15935.  This strong growth is mainly related to
the acquisition of Reebok.  In addition,  new employees were
primarily added in adidas own-retail activities as well as at
adidas in Asia.  The Group excluding Reebok employed 18821
people at year-end.  Personnel expenses increased 54% to
€ 1087 billion in 2006 from € 706 million in 2005 (see Note
26,  p.  173),  representing 29% of the Group's total operating
expenses (2005: 28%).  Personnel expenses for the Group
excluding Reebok increased 13% to € 800 million. 
Workforce Spread around the Globe
Our employees work at more than 150 locations around the
world.  In 2006,  42% of our staff were employed in Europe
(2005: 50% excluding Reebok),  35% in North America (2005:
22% excluding Reebok),  19% in Asia (2005: 24% excluding Reebok) and 4% in Latin America (2005: 5% excluding
Reebok).  The strong growth in the number of employees in
North America was attributable to the acquisition of Reebokwhere the majority of the workforce is US-based.

Highly-Qualified Multi-Cultural Workforce
One of our Group's strengths is the cultural diversity of our
workforce.  We believe this diversity helps us to sustain a competitive advantage,  to foster motivation and to ensure organizational success and stability.  Therefore,  we are committed to understanding,  valuing and incorporating the growing
diversity of our global marketplace into the corporate culture
of the adidas Group.  As a result,  our workforce comprises
men and women of various nationalities,  cultures,  religions
and races,  who encompass a wide range of experience,  skills
and mentalities.  At our corporate headquarters,  for examplewe have employees from over 40 countries.  Diversity for us
also includes encouraging healthy discussion throughout our
workforce.  Via our global intranet,  we offer our employees the
opportunity to exchange ideas directly with top management
and submit suggestions for improving our business.  This supports our pursuit of continuous improvement in a cost- and
time-efficient way. 
Five Core Processes Define Human Resources Function
Having strong Human Resources capabilities will provide us
with a competitive edge both within and outside our industry. 
The main goals of our Global Human Resources function are
to create a working environment that stimulates team spiritpassion,  engagement and achievement,  to instill a performance culture,  and to make the adidas Group the 'employer
of choice".  As we strive to identify,  recruit and retain the
most talented people and develop career opportunities for
them,  our Human Resources function focuses on five core
processes: attracting,  recruiting,  developing,  rewarding,  and
retaining staff.

Superior Attracting and Recruiting Efforts
To become and remain the 'employer of choice",  we strive to
consistently enhance our employer branding,  i, e.  to position
the adidas Group as an attractive and credible employer.  In
order to attract future high-potential employees,  we closely
cooperate with universities and recruiting platforms,  illustrating our Group's employment proposition.  In 2006,  we
ranked second of the 100 most attractive employers for business students according to The European Student Barometerthe largest survey of university students across 14 European
countries conducted by the trendence Institute for Personnel
Marketing.  This clearly underlines our successful efforts to
increase our attractiveness as an employer.  To strengthen our
workforce,  we not only need to attract but also to recruit high
potentials.  In order to have access to the best suitable talent
on a global scale,  we launched the 'World Class Recruiter"
initiative in 2006,  in which we established a new strategic
recruiting and employer branding competence center for the
Group.  We are also partnering with an external software provider to roll out our global e-recruiting platform to increase
the efficiency,  effectiveness and speed of our recruitment
process.  Other initiatives include continuous improvement to
our workforce planning and orientation programs as well as
to our employee integration process.

Nurturing Emerging Employees
We strive to provide our emerging employees (i, e.  apprenticesinterns and trainees) with the best possible start into our
workforce.  To this end,  we have set up clearly defined and targeted programs which allow us to support them in their quest
for knowledge and experience while learning more about
their strengths and potential for next possible career opportunities within the adidas Group.  Our business administration
and retail apprenticeship programs in Germany offer young
people who want to join our Group straight out of high school
with the opportunity to gain relevant business experience in
 three-year rotation program.  The goal of our global internship program is to provide university students with a challenging and interesting four to six months work experience
period within the adidas Group.  With our 'Re-Bound" Program,  we want to attract our former 'best-of-class" interns
to remain in contact with the adidas Group after finishing the
original internship and to become future employees.  In addition to our apprenticeship and internship programs,  we offer
students with an international background and excellent educational credentials the opportunity to start their career with
the adidas Group in our 12- to 18-month functional trainee
program.  On top of this functional program,  we have implemented an international cross-functional and cross-brand
'Business Management Program",  hiring 10 top talents and
training and developing them to take over management positions in the future.

Employee Development Based On Three Success Drivers
Just like athletes,  our Group's employees need a training plan
to build on their strengths,  overcome their own challenges
and improve their technique to achieve their goals.  In 2006we further extended our development program.  This incorporates behavioral,  managerial,  technical and language training
for different target groups.  We base our efforts on three success drivers:

Talent
Management 
»  Performance Management: Evaluation tools such as PEP
('Performance Evaluation and Planning") which are part of
our Global Salary Management System measure employees'
current performance based on job and competency requirements and link performance levels directly to compensation. 
»  Talent Management: With specifically designed talent
management tools and processes,  we identify employees at
all levels who have the potential to become leaders in the
business.  In order to prepare them for new and more complex future roles,  they participate in targeted development
programs for various levels within the organization.  In 2006we rolled out a new Management Development Program and
Executive Development Program to actively support the longterm employability and retention of our top talents.

Performance at Core of Remuneration System
Our Global Salary Management System sets employees'
salaries in a clear,  understandable and measurable way.  It
relates to performance evaluation and uses a clearly defined
system for setting salaries in line with market requirements
and performance levels.  Managers and the HR department
can evaluate where each employee currently is within the system based on his/her current salary and where he/she should
be.  We also offer various attractive variable compensation
components:
»  Pay for Performance bonus program: More than 20% of
all employees receive this variable salary component with an
average of 20% of their remuneration linked directly to individual and Group performance. 
»  Long-Term Incentive Programs (LTIP): These include
brand- or business-specific three-year plans for senior managers that are based on the achievement of financial as well
as compliance targets (see Compensation Report,  p.  30). 
»  Management Share Option Plan (MSOP): Beneficiaries
of the MSOP (members of Executive Board and senior management) may exercise stock options granted to them in five
tranches since 1999 if at least one of two performance criteria
is met (see Note 33,  p.  178). 
»  Other benefits include our 401-K pension plans in the USA
and the PP 2000 pension plan for our employees in Germany. 
In 2006,  1154 employees participated in the latter,  which represents an increase of 7% compared to the previous year.

Successful Retention Efforts
To ensure we retain our key employees,  we strive to have a
happy,  highly-motivated workforce.  We offer our employees
 challenging,  fun and financially rewarding working environment,  where fair competition and a responsible attitude
towards the environment and our internal and external business relationships are encouraged.  Through our Work-Life
Balance Program we aim to harmonize the Group's commercial interests with the private and family needs of our
employees,  because we are convinced that every employee's
quality of life should be improved by working for the adidas
Group.  This program includes family-oriented services,  flexible work time and place,  people development and leadership
competence related to work-life balance.  Additionally,  we
offer our employees a wide range of sports activities at our
major sites.

Significant Progress in Reebok Integration
Bringing together colleagues from Reebok and the adidas
Group,  managing the change process,  ensuring a fair and
transparent appointment process for the leadership positions
in the new Group and harmonizing people and performance
management-related topics were major focus points in 2006. 
We completed an extensive appointment process (over 1000
new appointments) partnering with an external consultant to
assure fairness and consistency.  In addition,  we have aligned
our Human Resources systems and enabled Reebok employees to participate in the Group's personnel development programs,  giving them access to a wider range of career opportunities.  Our regular 'pulse check" that measures employee
alignment and engagement in the integration process underscores that our employees are growing together in an environment of trust,  willingness to change and passion to perform. 
Managers Ensure Compliance with Code of Conduct
In 2006,  a multi-cultural team from various functions and
geographies within the Group developed and established
our new Global Code of Conduct (see Corporate Governance
Report,  p.  26).  All managers with personnel responsibility
are now accountable to ensure compliance with the Code. 
Employees who violate the law or the Code of Conduct while
conducting Group business will be subject to disciplinary
measures up to and including termination of employment.

Research & Development
We believe that product innovation leadership is ­critical
to the sustained success of our Group.  As a result,  we
invest considerable resources into continuously developing
technological innovations and contemporizing our design
philosophy,  to best unite our brand values with the unique
needs of our consumers.  The research and development
process is driven by internal teams of designers,  product
developers as well as in-house experts from the fields of
biomechanics,  materials technology,  product and process
engineering and similar disciplines.

» Research & Development 
Brand-Specific Global R&D Activities
Research and development within the adidas Group is organized in a decentralized structure,  i, e.  each brand separately
runs its own research,  design and development activitieswith major locations in several countries.  Our brand teams
collaborate closely,  sharing fundamental and biomechanical
research to utilize the full scope of our R&D organization.  In
addition,  our brands share existing technologies.  The adidas
Torsion® technology,  for example,  will be applied across
 collection of Rockport men's footwear in 2007 (see Campaigns and Products,  p.  117).  Furthermore,  our research and
development functions work with our vast network of manufacturing partners around the globe,  to increase efficiency in
the product development and engineering processes. 
Highly Skilled Technical Personnel
For all our brands,  the foundation and success of our R&D
efforts depend on bringing together a diverse and highly skilled
workforce,  and providing them with cutting-edge technology. 
Personnel expenses represent by far the largest portion of
R&D expenses,  accounting for over 67% of total R&D expenditure.  At December 31,  2006,  1040 people were employed
in the Group's R&D activities compared to 636 employees in
2005 (+ 64%).  This represents 4% of total Group employees
(2005: 4%).  The increase in employees was mainly driven by
the first-time inclusion of Reebok R&D staff.  The R&D departments for each brand comprise experienced teams from different areas of expertise including mechanical engineeringmaterials engineering,  industrial design,  biomechanics,  finite
element analysis,  advanced CAD design and product development.  Our teams also include commercialization engineers
as well as experts in production techniques,  costing,  packaging and IT systems.

Holistic R&D Approach at adidas
R&D activities at adidas focus on the development of revolutionary footwear,  apparel and hardware technologies.  To
solidify the adidas brand's position as a leader in technology
and innovation,  the adidas Innovation Team (ait) is responsible for developing cutting-edge technologies and concepts
in all product categories.  ait creates products that drive the
success of the adidas brand,  to give consumers exciting and
relevant sports experiences.  The team is divided into groups
that focus on individual product categories such as basketball or football or cross-category project areas such as Intelligent Products or Energy Management Systems (cushioning
technologies).  These groups see the complete R&D process
through from initial sketches to final production.  R&D projects follow a holistic approach that involves collaborating
with professional and recreational athletes to test and optimize products according to their needs and ideas.  This concept of an R&D team creating market-ready products clearly
is a competitive advantage in the sporting goods industry. 
adidas does not purchase any R&D expertise except fundamental research.  To that extent,  the team collaborates with
well-established global research partners such as the Sports
Technology Research Group of the University of Loughborough,  England on long-term projects studying,  for examplethe characteristics of footballs or motion analysis in running
and basketball.  As a result of multi-faceted R&D projects,  the
ait has developed major innovations for 2007 which include
adidas1 intelligent footwear technology in running and basketball,  BOUNCE™ in footwear,  ForMotion™ in footwear and
apparel and TechFit™ Powerweb in functional apparel.

Divisional R&D Structure at Reebok
Within the Reebok segment,  the Reebok,  Reebok-CCM
Hockey and Rockport divisions run separate R&D teams due
to the different product offering of each.  At brand Reebokthe R&D team creates footwear,  apparel and equipment with
the primary focus being the enhancement of fit and comfort for the consumer.  The main goal of this R&D team is to
develop product that provides a perfect fit for the consumer
based on function,  aesthetics and value.  The R&D team at
Reebok-CCM Hockey is dedicated to continuously creating innovative state-of-the-art hockey equipment used by
both professional and recreational players.  Rockport's R&D
function primarily focuses on developing insole components
of footwear while incorporating the Group's advanced proprietary athletic footwear and also industry-leading proprietary technologies into the outsole of both casual and dress
shoes.  R&D at all Reebok divisions includes a development/
engineering team as well as a design and commercialization team,  a human performance laboratory and a prototype
sampling group with the ­ product marketing teams in each
strategic business unit.  Major ­ projects involve extensive

­ iomechanical,  fit,  wear and materials testing and include
collaborative tests with athletes.  To further increase competitiveness,  ­Reebok's divisional R&D teams are extending
own R&D activities while significantly reducing the utilization of R&D expertise purchased from external parties.  The
teams,  however,  continue to work in partnership with contracted manufacturers to share R&D resources.  The Reebok
R&D teams developed several important technologies to be
used in 2007 products including the Kinetic Fit System (KFS)The Pump™ 20 ­ custom fit technology,  DMX footwear cushioning,  PlayDry moisture management and the Rbk EDGE
Uniform System™.

adhere to that tenet by designing and developing industryleading equipment,  utilizing an array of sophisticated tools
to improve existing technologies and introduce revolutionary
new ones.  Before products are brought to market,  the R&D
team conducts extensive testing activities including frequent
and thorough input and feedback from tour professionals.

First-Time Consolidation of Reebok Impacts R&D Expenses
Given the short product lifecycles in the sporting goods
industry,  R&D costs at the adidas Group are recognized as
expense in the period in which they are incurred and are not
capitalized.  The increase in employees,  primarily as a result
of the acquisition of Reebok,  drove R&D expenses higher by
56% to € 98 million in 2006 (2005: € 63 million).  For the Group
excluding Reebok,  R&D expenses increased 14% to € 72 million.  In 2006,  R&D expenses represented 26% of total operating expenses versus 24% in the prior year.  R&D expenses as
 percentage of sales increased slightly to 10% from 09%
in 2005.  Other related expenses for product develop­ment and
market research,  for example,  were incurred as part of the
Group's other operating overheads. 
Active Trademark and Patent Protection Policy
To capitalize on the Group's R&D achievements,  we seek to
gain trademark and patent protection for our key productstechnologies and innovations in all major markets for footwear,  apparel and hardware.  We hold registered trademark
rights or have applied for trademark protection for the Group's
brands and other proprietary names in most countries around
the world.  Our business is not dependent upon any single patent or licensed technology.  As part of our business policy,  we
rigorously defend the adidas Group's trademarks and patents
by monitoring and prosecuting infringements of trademark
and patent rights around the world (see Risk Report,  p.  96).

Successful Product Introductions Highlight R&D Strength
Developing industry-leading technologies is only one aspect
of being an innovation leader.  Even more important is the successful commercialization of those technological innovations. 
The majority of the adidas Group's sales in 2006 were generated with products newly introduced in the course of the
year.  At brand adidas,  products launched in 2006 accounted
for 79% of brand sales.  Only 5% of total sales were generated with products introduced three or more years ago.  Two
examples of how adidas transformed technological innovations into commercial success in 2006 are the first modular football boot +F50 TUNIT and the +Teamgeist™ match
ball of the 2006 FIFA World Cup™.  After being launched in
the market in March 2006,  sales of the +F50 TUNIT football
boot clearly surpassed our original targets.  Similarly,  after
successfully launching the +Teamgeist™ in December 2005
featuring a completely new 14-panel configuration,  sales figures clearly exceeded our original targets.  An example of how
Reebok successfully commercialized R&D efforts in 2006 is
the Trinity KFS running shoe introduced in 2006,  featuring
both the innovative KFS upper material construction and DMX
cushioning.  This shoe was very well received at retail and won
the prestigious Global Runner's World Editor's Choice award. 
In the TaylorMade-adidas Golf segment,  current products (i, e. 
products launched in the last 18 months,  which is the typical
product lifecycle in golf) represented 79% of total sales.  Products that had been brought to market three or more years ago
accounted for 8% of ­TaylorMade-adidas Golf sales.  As in prior
years,  all our brands will launch several new highlight products during the course of 2007 featuring major technologies
(see Subsequent Events and Outlook,  p.  106).

In 2006,  the global economy grew around 4%,  although growth
decelerated in the course of the year as a result of rising
commodity prices and tightening monetary policies in several industrialized countries.  In line with a marked increase
in consumer confidence,  growth of the European economy
strengthened considerably in the course of 2006 to reach
approximately 25% for the full year.  The region's emerging
markets again outperformed the Western economies with
growth rates above 5%.  In the USA,  economic growth again
exceeded 3% in 2006,  but slowed over the course of the year as
 result of weakness in residential investment and industrial
production which more than offset solid export growth.  The
Asian economies continued their stable economic upswing
from previous years,  again making Asia the most dynamic
economic region in the world.  For the region as a whole,  GDP
again grew almost 8%.  In Japan,  the economy expanded by
around 2%,  while growth in China exceeded 10%.  The region's
other emerging markets developed positively as a result of
flourishing export activity.  The Latin American economies
continued to benefit from the global surge in commodity
prices and the healthy world economy which supported export
activity,  reaching GDP growth of around 45% in 2006.

Regionally Mixed Development of Sporting Goods Industry
The sporting goods industry had a mixed regional development in 2006.  The European sporting goods industry largely
focused on the 2006 FIFA World Cup™,  which helped to compensate for subdued consumer spending in the first half
of the year.  Nonetheless,  footwear sales decreased at lowsingle-digit rates in 2006 compared to the previous yearwhereas apparel sales increased at low-single-digit rateslargely driven by the increased football offering.  From a country perspective,  strong growth in Spain and Italy was offset by
promotional market conditions particularly in the UK,  which
led to declines in volume and price points.  Average selling
prices fell across the region with the exception of Germany
and Spain.  The sporting goods industry in North America
was dominated by a shift towards sport fusion styles which
gained strongly on the back of significant losses in the classics category.  The footwear market increased by low-singledigit rates in 2006 compared to the prior year,  whereas the
apparel market grew at high-single-digit rates.  In addition to
the sport fusion category,  skateboarding increased markedlywhereas basketball and running decreased compared to the
prior year.  Amongst retailers,  industry growth was strongest
in the sporting goods and family footwear channels,  whereas
athletic specialty sales declined moderately.  Average selling prices increased marginally across the industry.  In the
Asian sporting goods market,  consumer demand and retail
sentiment remained strong throughout the region,  so that
the industry grew by high-single-digit rates in 2006.  Stagnation in Japan and the region's other industrialized countries was more than compensated by strong growth in China
and the region's other emerging markets.  Average selling
prices were stable in most of the region's countries.  In Latin
America,  the sporting goods industry developed in line with
the overall economy and recorded a mid-single-digit sales
increase compared to the prior year.  Average selling prices
were stable.

adidas Group Outpaces Industry and
Overall Economic Growth
In 2006,  adidas Group revenues grew significantly faster
than both the economy and the sporting goods industry in all
regions,  even excluding the effects from the first-time consolidation of Reebok.  Private consumption and consumer
confidence are important factors contributing to the development of our industry.  In 2006,  as expected,  the sporting goods
industry outperformed the economy in most regions,  boosted
by major sporting events such as the 2006 FIFA World Cup™and increasing demand for sports-inspired footwear and
apparel.  Through our strong product offering,  driven by major
product innovations and attractive designs in several categories,  we were able to grow faster than our major competitors
in terms of both sales and profitability.

Income Statement
First-Time Consolidation of Reebok Impacts 2006 Results
The business of Reebok International Ltd.  (USA) and its subsidiaries,  which was acquired to broaden the adidas Group's
product offering and to increase the Group's long-term growth
opportunities,  is consolidated within the adidas Group as of
February 1,  2006.  The adidas Group's 2006 reported financial
results were significantly impacted by this consolidation.  Most
visible is the strong increase in Group sales.  The Group's gross
and operating margins,  however,  were negatively impacted
by Reebok's lower than Group average margins as well as
accounting effects from purchase price allocation such as the
impact of fair values charged to expense in the income statement (see Reebok Business Performance,  p.  91).  In additionthe Group's IBT was negatively impacted by the financing of
the Reebok acquisition,  which led to a significant increase
of the Group's financial expenses in 2006.  The performance
of this business is shown in the Reebok segment.  Reebok's
results are not comparable with 2005 reported results for
several reasons (see Reebok Business Performance,  p.  91). 
As a consequence,  no prior year figures for the Reebok segment are given at the Group level.  However,  to show Reebok's
comparable development,  prior year sales figures are provided in the Reebok section of this report. 

Group Management Report  ›

Exceptional Factors Impact 2006 Operational Performance
In 2006,  several other exceptional factors influenced the
reported operating results for the Group and the segments. 
Over the course of the year,  brand adidas was positively
influenced by strong sales related to the 2006 FIFA World
Cup™,  which took place in our home market Germany and
for which adidas was Official Sponsor,  Supplier and Licensee. 
TaylorMade-adidas Golf was positively impacted by the inclusion of the Greg Norman apparel business until the end of
November,  when the business was divested.  Sales recorded
in the HQ/Consolidation segment increased strongly,  positively impacted by € 86 million of sales related to the Group's
cooperation agreement with Amer Sports Corporation,  under
which the adidas Group sources softgoods for Salomon at a
fixed buying commission for a limited period in an effort to
support the transfer of Salomon's business activities to Amer
Sports Corporation.  However,  this agreement includes margins significantly below the Group's average and therefore
negatively impacted the Group's gross and operating margin
development in 2006.  In addition,  Reebok's operating margin was negatively impacted by additional costs in connection with the closure of production facilities at manufacturing partners in Indonesia in the fourth quarter of 2006.  The
Group's minority interests were impacted by the purchase of
the remaining 9% of shares from the joint venture partner of
the adidas subsidiary in India as well as by the purchase of
the remaining 49% of shares from the joint venture partner of
the adidas subsidiary in Korea,  effective February 1,  2006 and
September 1,  2006,  respectively (see Note 5,  p.  156).

Group Sales Surpass € 10 billion in 2006
In 2006,  Group sales increased 53% on a currency-­neutral
basis,  strongly supported by the first-time consolidation
of Reebok.  In euro terms,  Group reven­ues grew 52% to
€ 10084 billion in 2006 from € 6636 billion in 2005,  exceeding
the € 10 billion level for the first time in the Group's history. 
Sales for the adidas Group excluding Reebok increased 14%
on a currency-neutral basis.  Double-digit growth was gener-­
ated in all regions except Europe,  where sales increased by
high-single-digit rates.  Sales for the adidas Group exclud-­
ing Reebok grew 14% in euro terms to € 7548 billion in 2006
from € 6636 billion in the prior year,  representing the high-­
est organic growth of the adidas Group within the last eight
years. 
Double-Digit Growth at adidas and TaylorMade-adidas Golf
The adidas segment was the main driver of the Group's
organic sales growth in 2006.  Currency-neutral adidas reve­
nues grew 14% in 2006 driven by increases in nearly all Sport
Performance categories as well as double-digit growth in the
Sport Heritage and Sport Style divisions.  First-time consoli-­
dation of the Reebok segment added € 2473 billion in sales
to the adidas Group.  At TaylorMade-adidas Golf,  currencyneutral revenues increased 22%.  This strong performance
was driven by solid growth in nearly all major product cat-­
egories.  Further,  the inclusion of the Greg Norman apparel
business,  which was acquired as part of the Reebok acquisi-­
tion,  also had a positive impact on the Group's sales devel-­
opment.  Sales recorded in the HQ/Consolidation segment
increased by 97% on a currency-neutral basis,  as a result
of the Group's cooperation agreement with Amer Sports
Corporation.  Currency translation effects had only a minor
negative impact on sales in euro terms.  adidas sales in euros
increased 13% to € 6626 billion in 2006 from € 5861 billion in
2005.  TaylorMade-adidas Golf sales in euro terms grew 21%
to € 856 million in 2006 from € 709 million in 2005.  HQ/Con-­
solidation sales in euro terms increased 96% to € 129 million
in 2006 from € 66 million in 2005.

enue increases at both adidas and TaylorMade-adidas Golf.

2006 from € 1523 billion in 2005.  Currency-neutral sales in
Asia for the adidas Group excluding Reebok increased 20%
during the period,  primarily driven by strong growth at brand
adidas.  This marks the third consecutive year of double-digit
underlying growth for our Group in the region.  In euro termsrevenues grew 18% to € 1791 billion in 2006 from € 1523 bil-­
lion in the prior year.  In Latin America,  currency-neutral sales
increased 53%.  In euro terms,  sales grew 56% to € 499 mil-­
lion in 2006 from € 319 million in 2005.  Currency-neutral

opment of the adidas brand.  In euro terms,  sales increased
35% to € 429 million from € 319 million in the prior year.

from € 2978 billion in 2005.  Currency-neutral footwear sales

Cost of Sales Growth Largely in Line with Revenue Increase
Our Group defines cost of sales as the amount we pay to third
parties for expenses associated with producing and delivering our products.  Similarly,  although only representing a very
small portion of total cost of sales,  own-production expenses
at adidas and Reebok as well as assembling expenses at
TaylorMade-adidas Golf are also included in the Group's cost
of sales.  In 2006,  cost of sales was € 5589 billion,  representing an increase of 63% from € 3439 billion in 2005.  This
reflects higher sourcing costs necessitated by the first-time
consolidation of the Reebok business.  For the adidas Group
excluding Reebok,  cost of sales grew 15% to € 3943 billion
in 2006 from € 3439 billion in 2005,  broadly in line with the
strong organic sales growth during the period.  Increasing
labor and raw material costs were largely compensated by
efficiency gains within our supply chain as well as positive
impacts from an improved business and product mix.

Group Gross Profit Increases 41%
The Group's gross margin declined 36 percentage points to
446% of sales in 2006 (2005: 482%),  mainly reflecting the
first-time consolidation of Reebok,  which more than offset a positive gross margin development in the adidas segment.  Due to Reebok's strong presence in North Americawhere average gross margins are lower than in other regionsReebok carries a significantly lower gross margin than the
Group average.  In addition,  Reebok's gross profit in 2006
includes negative impacts from purchase price allocation in
an amount of € 76 million.  As a result of the Group's strong
top-line growth,  gross profit rose by 41% in 2006 to reach
€ 4495 billion versus € 3197 billion in the prior year.  For
the adidas Group excluding Reebok,  gross margin decreased
04 percentage points to 478% in 2006 (2005: 482%),  mainly
due to a gross margin decline in the Group's HQ/Consolidation segment as a result of the Group's cooperation agreement with Amer Sports Corporation,  which more than offset
the gross margin increase at adidas.  The gross margin of
TaylorMade-adidas Golf declined marginally as a result of the
inclusion of the Greg Norman apparel business.  Gross profit
for the Group excluding Reebok grew by 13% to € 3605 billion
in 2006 (2005: € 3197 billion). 
Royalty and Commission Income Grows Strongly
Royalty and commission income for the adidas Group increased
94% on a currency-neutral basis,  mainly driven by the firsttime consolidation of the Reebok business.  In euro termsroyalty and commission income increased by 91% to € 90 million in 2006 from € 47 million in the prior year.  ­Royalty and
commission income for the adidas Group excluding Reebok
increased 19% on a currency-neutral basis due to higher

­ oyalty and commission income at brand adidas.  An increased
number of units sold as well as higher average ­royalty rates

Operating Expenses as a Percentage of Sales Decrease
Group operating expenses,  including depreciation and amortization (excluding goodwill),  are influenced by two components: marketing working budget and operating overhead
costs.  Operating expenses as a percentage of sales declined
15 percentage points to 367% in 2006 from the 2005 level
of 382%.  This decrease mainly reflects Reebok's lower than
Group average operating expense level despite negative
effects from purchase price allocation.  In absolute termsoperating expenses increased by 46% to € 3704 billion in 2006
from € 2537 billion in 2005.  For the adidas Group excluding
Reebok,  operating expenses as a percentage of sales were
380% in 2006,  which is 02 percentage points lower than the
2005 level of 382%.  Continued efficiency improvements in
operating overhead costs more than offset higher marketing
expenses related to the 2006 FIFA World Cup™.  In absolute
terms,  operating expenses for the adidas Group excluding Reebok increased by 13% to € 2872 billion in 2006 from
€ 2537 billion in 2005.

adidas Group  ›

Marketing Working Budget Down as a Percentage of Sales
Our Group's marketing working budget is well balanced
between the major marketing components,  which are communication (including advertising,  retail presentation and
public relations) and promotion partnerships.  Marketing
working budget as a percentage of sales declined 13 percentage points to 129% in 2006 from 142% in the prior yearmainly reflecting the first-time consolidation of Reebok. 
Reebok's marketing working budget as a percentage of sales
is significantly lower than Group average as a result of the
smaller portion of sales generated by performance products
in the Reebok segment.  Excluding Reebok,  marketing working budget as a percentage of sales declined 01 percentage points to reach 141%.  This was related to a significant
decline of marketing expenditure as a percentage of sales
at TaylorMade-adidas Golf which more than compensated
higher marketing expenditures at brand adidas related to the
2006 FIFA World Cup™. 
Operating Overheads Decrease as a Percentage of Sales
Group operating overheads include overhead costs related to
marketing,  sales,  logistics,  research and development as well
as central finance and administration functions.  Operating
overhead expenses as a percentage of sales declined 02 percentage points to 238% in 2006 from 240% in the prior year
as a result of the first-time consolidation of Reebok.  Excluding Reebok,  operating overheads as a percentage of sales
were stable at 240% as a result of lower administrative costs
within the Group's headquarter functions which more than
offset higher own-retail expenditures at brand adidas. 
No Amortization of Goodwill and Trademarks Incurred
In accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards,  intangible assets with unlimited useful lives (goodwill
and trademarks) are tested annually and additionally when
there are indications of potential impairment.  In 2006,  as well
as in 2005,  no impairment was incurred.

Operating Profit Grows 25%
Group operating margin declined 19 percentage points to
87% of sales in 2006 (2005: 107%).  This mainly reflects the
first-time consolidation of the Reebok business,  which carries
 significantly lower operating margin than the Group average.  The segment's operating margin also includes a negative impact from purchase price allocation on cost of sales
and operating expenses in a total amount of € 89 million.  The
first cost synergies related to the Reebok integration,  which
we expect to positively impact the Group's operating margin
from 2007 onwards,  were offset by one-time costs in 2006. 
As a result of strong sales growth,  however,  operating profit
for the adidas Group rose 25% in 2006 to reach € 881 million
versus € 707 million in 2005.  For the adidas Group excluding Reebok,  the operating margin decreased 02 percentage
points to 105% in 2006 from 107% in the prior year.  An operating margin decline in the Group's HQ/Consolidation segment as a result of the Group's cooperation agreement with
Amer Sports Corporation more than offset operating margin
increases at both adidas and TaylorMade-adidas Golf.  Operating profit for the adidas Group excluding Reebok grew by 12%
to € 789 million in 2006 from € 707 million in the prior year.

Reebok Acquisition Drives Net Financial Expenses Increase
Net financial expenses increased 203% to € 158 million in
2006 from € 52 million in the prior year.  This reflects the
financing of the Reebok acquisition.  The cash outflow for this
transaction occurred at the end of January 2006. 
Financial Income Down 5%
Financial income decreased 5% to € 39 million in 2006 from
€ 42 million in the prior year.  This reflects the reduction in the
Group's cash position after the acquisition of Reebok in January 2006. 
Financial Expenses Increase due to Reebok Acquisition
Financial expenses increased 111% to € 197 million in 2006
(2005: € 94 million),  particularly as a result of the financing
of the Reebok acquisition.  An increase of the weighted average interest rate also had an impact on this development (see
Treasury,  p.  85). 
Income Before Taxes Up 10%
As a result of the operating improvements in the adidas and
TaylorMade-adidas Golf segments,  income before taxes (IBT)
increased 10% to € 723 million in 2006 from € 655 million
in 2005.  As a percentage of sales,  however,  IBT decreased
by 27 percentage points to 72% in 2006 from 99% in 2005reflecting the Group's lower operating margin as well as the
significant increase in net financial expenses related to the
Reebok acquisition.

Net Income From Continuing Operations Grows 14%
The Group's net income from continuing operations increased
14% to € 496 million in 2006 from € 434 million in 2005.  The
Group's strong sales increase was the main driver of this
improvement.  In addition,  net income was positively impacted
by the lower tax rate,  which declined 23 percentage points to
314% in 2006 (2005: 337%),  mainly due to a more favorable
earnings mix throughout the Group as well as a one-time tax
benefit in the fourth quarter of 2006 (see Note 28,  p.  174).

No Income/Loss From Discontinued Operations
In 2006,  no income or loss from discontinued operations was
incurred.  This compares to a loss from discontinued operations in the amount of € 44 million in 2005 related to the
Salomon business segment,  which was divested in October
2005. 
Minority Interests Increase by 74%
The Group's minority interests increased 74% to € 13 million in
2006 from € 7 million in the prior year.  This increase primarily
reflects higher minority interests related to the adidas joint
venture in Korea in the first eight months of the year before
the adidas Group assumed full ownership of the subsidiary on
September 1,  2006.  In addition,  the first-time consolidation of
the Reebok business impacted this development.

Net Income Attributable to Shareholders Increases 26%
The Group's net income attributable to shareholders increased
26% to € 483 million in 2006 from € 383 million in the prior
year.  This improvement reflects the outstanding performance
of the adidas and TaylorMade-adidas Golf segments as well
as the non-recurrence of losses from discontinued operations related to the Salomon business in 2005. 
Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share Up 16% and 17%
On June 6,  2006,  adidas AG conducted a share split in a ratio
of 1:4,  with each existing adidas AG share being divided into
four shares (see Our Share,  p.  34).  All numbers of shares
have been restated.  The Group's basic earnings per share
from continuing and discontinued operations increased 16%
to € 237 in 2006 versus € 205 in 2005 despite the capital
increase conducted on November 3,  2005.  The Group's total
number of shares outstanding increased by 489840 shares in
2006 to 203536860 as a result of shares from stock options
exercised as part of Tranches II,  III and IV of the Management
Share Option Plan (MSOP) of adidas AG,  as well as the conversion of one tranche of the convertible bond (see Note 22p.  165).  Consequently,  the average number of shares used in
the calculation of basic earnings per share was 203386104
(2005 average: 186947832).  Diluted earnings per share from
continuing and discontinued operations in 2006 increased
17% to € 225 from € 193 in the prior year.  The dilutive effect
mainly results from approximately 16 million potential additional shares that could be created in relation to our outstanding convertible bond,  for which conversion criteria were met
for the first time at the end of 2004.

Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Statement
Reebok Acquisition Impacts Balance Sheet Items
Total assets grew considerably in 2006,  mainly reflecting the
first-time inclusion of assets and liabilities associated with the
Reebok business,  which was consolidated as of January 312006.  Reebok is consolidated in line with our Group's accounting practices.  As a result of the first-time inclusion of the
Reebok segment including Reebok's major properties in the
USA and Europe,  the Group's balance sheet structure changed
significantly (see Consolidated Balance Sheet,  p.  144).

Total Assets Increase 46%
At the end of 2006,  total assets increased 46% to € 8379 billion versus € 5750 billion in the prior year,  mainly as a result
of the first-time inclusion of assets related to the Reebok
business. 
Inventories Up 31%
Group inventories increased 31% to € 1607 billion in 2006
versus € 1230 billion in 2005,  largely as a result of the firsttime inclusion of € 404 million in inventories related to the
Reebok business.  On a currency-neutral basis,  this increase
was 41%.  Inventories for the adidas Group excluding Reebok
declined 2% (+ 5% currency-neutral).  The increase on a
currency-­neutral basis reflects the Group's growth expectations as well as higher inventory levels in Latin America in
advance of new import regulations in Brazil and Argentina. 
Receivables Grow 47%
Group receivables grew 47% (+ 57% currency-neutral) to
€ 1415 billion at the end of 2006 versus € 965 million in the
prior year,  primarily due to the first-time inclusion of receivables totaling € 461 million related to the Reebok business. 
Receivables for the adidas Group excluding Reebok decreased
1% (+ 5% currency-neutral).  The increase on a currencyn
­ eutral basis is lower than sales growth during the fourth
quarter of 2006. 
Other Current Assets Down 23%
Other current assets decreased 23% to € 413 million at the
end of 2006 from € 537 million in 2005.  Other current assets
for the adidas Group excluding Reebok were down 40%,  mainly
due to lower positive fair values of our financial instruments. 
This more than offset the impact from the first-time inclusion
of other current assets in an amount of € 90 million related to
the Reebok business.

allocation,  intangible assets were capitalized in amounts of
€ 1674 billion and € 1165 billion related to trademarks and
other intangible assets as well as goodwill,  respectively. 
Other additions of € 301 million in 2006 were partly counterbalanced by depreciation and amortization of € 217 million
and disposals in an amount of € 38 million.  Assets amounting
to € 30 million were transferred to assets held for sale (see
Note 4,  p.  155).  Currency effects had a negative impact on

for the adidas Group excluding Reebok decreased 10% (– 2%
currency-neutral) versus the prior year.  This decline reflects
the higher than usual year-end level in 2005 related to payables for a high volume of 2006 FIFA World Cup™ products.

Shareholder's Equity Up 5%
Shareholders' equity rose 5% to € 2828 billion at the end of
2006 versus € 2684 billion in 2005.  The majority of net income
was offset by negative currency translation effects due to the
strong euro against the US dollar. 
Expenses Related to Off-Balance Sheet Items
Our most important off-balance sheet assets are operating
leases,  which are related to offices,  retail stores,  warehouses
and equipment.  Rent expenses increased 63% to € 278 million in 2006 from € 171 million in the prior year,  mainly due to
the first-time inclusion of rent expenses related to the Reebok
business (see Note 5,  p.  156).  Rent expenses for the adidas
Group excluding Reebok increased 33%,  mainly reflecting the
continued expansion of own-retail activities at brand adidas. 
Strong Cash Flow Development
In 2006,  cash inflow from operating activities was € 762 million and was primarily used to finance working capital needs
in accordance with the seasonality of the business.  The Group
used € 2988 billion of net cash for investing activities mainly
related to the acquisition of Reebok including the buyback of
Reebok's major properties in the USA and Europe.  ­ Furtherthis development also reflects spending for property,  plant
and equipment,  such as investment in adidas own-retail activities.  Cash inflow from financing activities totaled € 1035 billion,  mainly reflecting increases in long-term borrowings to
finance the acquisition of Reebok.

»  The Treasury Committee,  consisting of members of the
Executive Board and other senior executives,  decides upon
the Group's treasury policy and provides strategic guidance
for managing treasury-related topics.  The Treasury Committee
approves all major changes to our treasury policy. 
»  The Group Treasury department is responsible for specific
centralized treasury transactions and for global implementation of our Group's treasury policy. 
»  On a subsidiary level,  local managing directors and financial controllers are responsible for managing treasury matters
in the respective subsidiaries.  Brand and regional controlling
ensures that the transactions of the individual business units
are in compliance with the Group's treasury policy.

Centralized Treasury Function
In accordance with our Group's treasury policy,  more than
90% of our worldwide credit lines are managed by the Group
Treasury department.  Portions of the lines are allocated to the
Group's subsidiaries and backed by parental guarantees.  As
 result of this centralized liquidity management,  the Group
is well positioned to allocate resources efficiently throughout
the organization.  The Group's debt is generally unsecured and
includes standard financial covenants which are reviewed on
 quarterly basis.  We maintain good relations with numerous partner banks,  thereby avoiding a strong dependency on
any single institution.  Banking partners of the Group and our
subsidiaries are required to have at least a BBB+ long-term
investment grade rating by Standard & Poor's or an equivalent
rating by another leading rating agency (see Note 24,  p.  171). 
To optimize the Group's cash position and ensure optimal allocation of liquid financial resources,  subsidiaries are required
to transfer excess cash to the Group's headquarters. 
Number and Volume of Financing Instruments Increased
The acquisition of Reebok International Ltd.  (USA) strongly
increased the Group's financing requirements.  As a result,  we
increased the number and volume of certain financing instruments.  By issuing private placements in the USA,  in Europe
and in Asia in a total amount of around € 13 billion in 2006we continued to diversify the Group's financing structure.  This

­ urther reduced our dependency on single credit institutions
and country-specific factors.  In addition,  long-term financial
flexibility is ensured by a currently unutilized € 20 billion syndicated loan as well as additional unutilized bilateral credit lines
at different banks in an amount of € 24 billion (see Note 16p.  160).  The Group's currency split of gross borrowings was
also further diversified in 2006.  We significantly increased our
US dollar-denominated financing to reflect the acquisition of
US dollar-based assets related to Reebok.  We monitor the
ongoing need for available credit lines based on the current
level of debt as well as future financing requirements.

Net Debt Position Better Than Target at € 2231 Billion
Net debt at December 31,  2006 was € 2231 billion,  up
€ 2782 billion versus a net cash position of € 551 million in
the prior year.  This increase was driven by the payment of
around € 32 billion for the acquisition of Reebok International
Ltd.  (USA),  paid on January 31,  2006.  This amount included
the buyback of employee stock options and Reebok's convertible bond.  In addition,  expenditure of around € 170 million for
the buyback of Reebok's major properties in the USA and in
Europe influenced this development (see Note 5,  p.  156).  The
net debt position at year-end was significantly better than our
original target of around € 25 billion,  communicated at the
beginning of 2006.  The Group's financial leverage was 789%
at the end of 2006,  clearly below our year-end target of 100%. 
On a net debt basis,  the utilization of the available credit facilities for the Group at the end of 2006 was 32%.

Financing Structure Further Diversified
In 2006,  we continued to diversify the Group's financing structure.  Bank borrowings increased 170% to € 275 million from
€ 102 million in the prior year and the total amount of our
private placements increased 215% to € 1784 billion in 2006
(2005: € 567 million).  The current value of the convertible bond
increased 2% to € 375 million in 2006 from € 366 million in the
prior year,  reflecting the accrued interest on the debt component in accordance with IFRS requirements.  As a result,  gross
borrowings increased to € 2578 billion at the end of 2006 from
€ 1035 billion in the prior year (see Note 16,  p.  160).

Interest Rate Increases Modestly
The weighted average interest rate on the Group's gross borrowings rose 08 percentage points to 48% in 2006 from 40%
in 2005,  mainly as a result of the significant increase of our
US dollar-denominated financing,  which carries interest rates
above euro-denominated financing.  In addition,  this reflects
an increased portion of longer-term fixed interest rate debt
financing arrangements in the total financing structure as a
result of the new financing instruments.  This provides better
protection against expected increases of interest rates in the
short and long term.  As a consequence,  long-term fixed-rate
financing amounted to around 65% of total financing at the
end of 2006.  Further,  interest rates for the Group's variable
financing,  which amounted to around 35% of total financing at
the end of the year,  increased due to higher market interest
rates in 2006.

Currency Management Reflects Reebok Integration
As the adidas Group operates worldwide,  currency management is a key focus of the Group's central Treasury department.  Because our Group sources the majority of products
from independent suppliers in Asia invoiced mainly in US
dollars,  the adidas Group's currency management focuses
on hedging the Group's net US dollar deficit.  In 2006,  the
central Treasury department managed a net deficit of
around US $ 17 billion against the euro,  which represents
an increase of approximately US $ 500 million from around
US $ 12 billion in the prior year.  This reflects the increased
size of our business mainly as a result of the first-time inclusion of Reebok in 2006.  In relation to our sales,  howeverthe net US dollar deficit against the euro was reduced.  As
outlined in our Group's treasury policy,  we have established
 rolling 12 to 18 months hedging system,  under which a
large amount of the anticipated seasonal hedging volume
is secured six months prior to the start of a season.  As a
result,  we have already completed around 90% of our anticipated hedging needs for 2007 at rates slightly below those
of 2006.  The use or combination of different hedging instruments,  such as currency options,  swaps and forward contracts,  protects us against unfavorable currency movementswhile retaining the potential to benefit from future favorable
exchange rate developments (see Note 24,  p.  171).

growth in footwear,  apparel and hardware.  Sales increased in
nearly all major product categories.  Football in particular,  but
also tennis and training,  contributed to this strong improvement.  In the football category,  sales were positively impacted
by adidas' role as Official Sponsor,  Supplier and Licensee of

Operating Expenses Increase
adidas operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased
09 percentage points to 354% in 2006 (2005: 345%).  This
increase primarily reflects higher marketing expenditures
associated with the 2006 FIFA World Cup™ as well as the continued expansion of adidas own-retail activities.  In absolute
terms,  operating expenses grew 16% to € 2345 billion in 2006
from € 2020 billion in 2005. 
Operating Profit Reaches € 788 million
In 2006,  the adidas operating margin improved by 01 percentage points to 119% from 118% in 2005.  This was a result of
higher sales and the improved gross margin,  which more than
offset higher operating expenses as a percentage of sales. 
Own-retail activities contributed overproportionately to operating profit due to a higher gross margin which more than
compensated higher operating expenses as a percentage of

Reebok Results Not Comparable with Prior Year
The business of Reebok International Ltd.  (USA) and its

­ ubsidiaries is consolidated within the adidas Group as of February 1,  2006.  The segment includes the brand units ReebokReebok-CCM Hockey and Rockport.  Reebok's results are not
comparable with 2005 reported results,  because only eleven
months of Reebok's 2006 results are consolidated.  Furtherthe NBA and Liverpool licensed businesses were transferred
to brand adidas in an effort to best utilize promotion partnerships.  Similarly,  the Greg Norman Collection (GNC) apparel
business was transferred to the TaylorMade-adidas Golf segment.  The GNC wholesale business was consolidated in the
TaylorMade-adidas Golf segment until the end of November
when it was sold to MacGregor Golf Company.  The results
of the GNC-related retail outlet operations,  which were not

Limited Comparability due to Accounting Effects
In addition to distorting effects from the factors outlined
above,  the comparability of 2006 results with the prior year is
not meaningful as the applicable accounting standards have
changed from US-GAAP to IFRS.  Further,  significant negative
impacts related to purchase price allocation are included in
the reported results: IFRS regulations stipulate that acquiring companies must allocate the purchase price paid for an
acquisition according to the fair values assigned to acquired
assets and liabilities,  the so-called purchase price allocation
(PPA).  Following the Reebok acquisition,  the adidas Group
hence assigned fair values to assets and liabilities of the
Reebok segment such as trademarks,  inventories,  backlogscontracts and patents.  The total fair value of around € 18 billion represents an increase of around € 11 billion from the
carrying net amount of € 07 billion.  As a result,  Reebok's gross
and operating margins were negatively affected by € 76 million and € 89 million respectively in 2006.  However,  these
charges had no cash effect or impact on our operating business and free cash flow generation.  Comparable prior year
figures based on US-GAAP can only be shown on a sales level
in this section. 
Segment Sales Decline 6% on a Like-for-Like Basis
In the period from February to December 2006,  sales for the
Reebok segment decreased 9% on a currency-neutral basis
as a result of declines in North America,  Europe and Latin
America that could not be offset by a double-digit revenue
increase in Asia.  In euro terms,  sales also decreased 9% to
€ 2473 billion in 2006 from € 2718 billion in 2005.  This revenue decline was expected,  following lower sales to certain
key accounts.  In addition,  the transfer of the NBA and Liverpool licensed businesses to brand adidas negatively affected
sales,  accounting for approximately 3 percentage points of
Reebok's sales decline.  As a result,  currency-neutral sales
for this segment decreased 6% on a like-for-like basis,  in line
with our initial guidance of a mid-single-digit decline.

Sales of Reebok-CCM Hockey,  which account for 8% of

product offering,  but also the absence of the prior year's

February to December 2006 decreased 13% on a currencyneutral basis.  In euro terms,  revenues also decreased 13%
to € 768 million in 2006 from € 885 million in 2005.  Sales
increases in the region's emerging markets,  in particular ­
Russia,  could not offset a particularly strong decline in the UK. 
Currency-Neutral Sales in North America Decline 9%
On a currency-neutral basis,  Reebok segment sales in North
America declined 9% in the period between February and

decreased in both the USA and Canada. 
Currency-Neutral Sales in Asia Grow 12%
Reebok segment sales in Asia grew 12% on a currencyn

2006.  This represents an increase of 11% in euro terms to
€ 229 million in 2006 from € 206 million in 2005.  The strong
sales growth was mainly a result of solid double-digit sales
increases in India and Korea.

Purchase Price Allocation Negatively Impacts Gross Margin
Reebok's gross margin was 350% in the period from February to December 2006.  This represents a gross profit of
€ 865 million,  significantly impacted by negative accounting
effects of € 76 million related to the purchase price allocation
for the Reebok segment.  Excluding these effects,  the Reebok
gross margin was 380%.  This margin is lower than the adidas
Group's average gross margin due to Reebok's overproportionate exposure to North America,  where average gross margins in our industry are generally lower than in other regions. 
In addition,  Reebok's gross margin was negatively impacted
by higher closeouts and increased promotional activities. 
Royalty and Commission Income at € 34 million
For the period from February to December 2006,  royalty and
commission income at Reebok was € 34 million.  This relates
primarily to royalty income from distribution partners and fitness equipment. 
Operating Expenses Significantly Below Group Average
Reebok operating expenses reached 328% as a percentage
of sales in the period from February to December 2006.  This
level is significantly below the Group average as a result of
Reebok's lower marketing working budget as a percentage of
sales.  In absolute terms,  operating expenses were € 812 million,  which included purchase price allocation effects of
€ 13 million. 
Operating Margin Negatively Impacted by PPA
The operating margin of the Reebok segment was 35% in
the period from February to December 2006.  Reebok's operating profit amounted to € 86 million,  significantly impacted
by the purchase price allocation for the Reebok segmentwhich totaled € 89 million.  The majority of this effect will not
be repeated in 2007 (see Subsequent Events and Outlookp.  106).  Excluding this effect,  ­Reebok's operating margin was
71% in 2006.

›  Group Business Performance 
Divestiture of Greg Norman Wholesale Business
As part of the Reebok acquisition,  the Greg Norman Collection
(GNC) apparel business was transferred from the Reebok
to the TaylorMade-adidas Golf segment effective February
1,  2006.  On October 24,  2006,  the adidas Group announced
the divestiture of the GNC wholesale business to MacGregor
Golf Company which was completed on November 21,  2006. 
As a result,  the GNC wholesale business was consolidated
within the TaylorMade-adidas Golf segment until the end of
November.  To increase transparency of the underlying business development,  segment sales are also provided excluding
the GNC business. 
Currency-Neutral Segment Sales Up 22%
Currency-neutral sales at TaylorMade-adidas Golf increased
22% in 2006.  This strong performance was driven by solid
revenue growth in nearly all major categories,  in particular irons and adidas Golf footwear and apparel.  In additionthe GNC apparel business contributed sales of € 63 million. 
In euro terms,  revenues grew 21% to € 856 million in 2006
from € 709 million in 2005.  Sales for the TaylorMade-adidas
Golf segment excluding the GNC apparel business increased
13% on a currency-neutral basis and 12% in euro terms to
€ 793 million in 2006 (2005: € 709 million). 
Currency-Neutral Sales in Europe Decrease 9%
On a regional basis,  currency-neutral sales in Europe
decreased 9%,  mainly as a result of declines in the UK.  In
euro terms,  European sales decreased 10% to € 92 million
(2005: € 102 million).  Currency-neutral sales for the segment
excluding the GNC apparel business decreased 13%.  In euro
terms,  sales declined by 13% to € 89 million from € 102 million in 2005. 

Development by Segment  ›

North America Sales Up 32% on a Currency-Neutral Basis
Sales in North America were up 32% on a currency-neutral
basis due to double-digit growth in the USA and Canada.  This
marks the highest growth in the region in four years.  In euro
terms,  sales in North America increased 32% to € 505 million in 2006 from € 383 million in the prior year.  Excluding the
GNC apparel business,  sales increased 17% on a currencyneutral basis.  In euro terms,  this represents an increase of
17% to € 446 million from € 383 million in the prior year. 
Asian Sales Increase 18% on a Currency-Neutral Basis
In Asia,  currency-neutral sales increased 18%,  driven by
strong growth in Korea and Japan.  Asian revenues in euro
terms increased 15% to € 254 million in 2006 versus € 221 million in the prior year.  Sales for the TaylorMade-adidas Golf
segment excluding the GNC apparel business increased 18%
on a currency-neutral basis.  This development represents an
increase of 15% in euro terms to € 253 million in 2006 from
€ 221 million in the prior year. 
Currency-Neutral Sales in Latin America Up 47%
In Latin America,  currency-neutral sales of TaylorMadeadidas Golf increased 47%,  albeit from a small base,  driven
by vigorous growth in Argentina.  Sales increased 45% in euro
terms to € 5 million (2005: € 3 million).  Currency-neutral
sales for the TaylorMade-adidas Golf segment excluding the
GNC apparel business increased 38% on a currency-­neutral
basis.  In euro terms,  sales grew 35% to € 4 million from
€ 3 million in 2005. 
Gross Margin Declines Slightly
TaylorMade-adidas Golf gross margin decreased 01 percentage points to 439% in 2006 from 440% in the prior year
due to the inclusion of the lower-margin GNC apparel business.  This effect was largely offset by improvements in the
golf balls,  putters and adidas Golf footwear business.  Driven
by strong sales improvement,  gross profit increased 21% to
€ 376 million in 2006 from € 312 million in 2005.  Excluding
the GNC apparel business,  gross margin increased 02 percentage points to 442% (2005: 440%).  Gross profit increased

Royalty and Commission Income Decreases
Royalty and commission income at TaylorMade-adidas Golf
declined 14% to negative € 16 million in 2006 (2005: negative € 15 million).  This development was driven by higher
intra-Group royalties paid to the adidas segment as a result
of increased sales at adidas Golf,  which are recorded in the
TaylorMade-adidas Golf segment.  In the adidas segmentthese intra-Group royalties are correspondingly shown as
part of royalty and commission income.  The increase in intraGroup royalties paid to the adidas segment was partly offset
by an increase in income,  which was primarily related to bags
and accessories. 
Operating Expenses as a Percentage of Sales Decline
Operating expenses at TaylorMade-adidas Golf increased
16% to € 287 million in 2006 from € 247 million in the prior
year.  As a percentage of sales,  however,  operating expenses
declined strongly in 2006,  decreasing 13 percentage points
to 335% (2005: 348%).  This reflects lower marketing expenditures as a percentage of sales due to the outstanding sales
growth during the year. 
Operating Profit Grows 44%
The TaylorMade-adidas Golf operating margin increased
14 percentage points to 85% in 2006 from 71% in 2005. 
This development was a result of the strong sales growth
and significantly improved operating expense leveragewhich more than offset the lower gross margin.  Operating
profit for TaylorMade-adidas Golf increased 44% to € 73 million in 2006 from € 50 million in 2005.  The operating margin
of TaylorMade-adidas Golf excluding the GNC apparel business increased 13 percentage points to 84% in 2006 (2005:
71%),  while operating profit grew 32% to € 67 million (2005:
€ 50 million).

Risk Report 
Strategic and Operational Risk Management
Principles and Process 
The adidas Group constantly explores and develops 
Within the adidas Group,  centralized risk management provides relevant tools and know-how to assist line managers
in central and brand function roles with the risk management process.  Further,  the central risk function aggregates
the identified risks on a Group-wide basis and monitors their
development over time.  Our Management continually integrates this risk information into its decision-making processes.  We are convinced that risks are best identified and
assessed where they arise,  reflecting that different business
segments and regions carry heterogeneous risk profiles. 
Our risk management process is composed of the following
steps:

opportunities to maximize earnings and to increase longterm shareholder value.  In doing so,  we acknowledge that
it is necessary to take certain risks to optimally explore
business opportunities in a well-controlled and managed
risk environment.  Our risk management principles provide
the framework for our Group-wide risk management. 

» Risk identification: The adidas Group constantly monitors
both the macroeconomic environment and developments in
the sporting goods industry as well as internal processes to
identify risks as early as possible.  As a result,  we have defined
 catalog of potential risks for our Group in each of these
areas that assists management at different levels within our
organization in identifying risks.

» Risk assessment: Identified risks are evaluated with
respect to occurrence probability and potential loss.  The
occurrence probability is categorized as 'high",  'medium" or
'low".  The extent of potential loss is measured on a case-bycase basis as the contribution deviation from the most recent
forecast under the assumption that the risk fully materializes.  Contribution is defined as operating profit excluding
intra-Group royalties. 

» Risk controlling: The Group centrally monitors how risks
in different areas and operational processes influence each
other.  Also,  central risk management examines the results
of actions taken by operational management to avoid,  reduce
or transfer risks over time.  Our Internal Audit department
independently appraises and assesses operational and internal controls for the management of business risks throughout the Group. 

» Risk monitoring and reporting: Risks are monitored by
central risk management as well as brand or headquarter
functions.  Risks with a likely impact of € 1 million or more
on forecasted full-year contribution are reported to central
risk management on a monthly basis.  In addition,  risks with a
likely financial impact of € 5 million or more must be reported
immediately upon identification to our central risk management.  Longer-term risks are reviewed as part of our strategic
planning process by means of scenario planning. 

» Risk management documentation: Our Group risk management manual is a core element of our integrated risk
management system.  It is available to all Group employees
online.  The manual outlines the principles,  processes,  toolsrisk areas and key responsibilities within our Group. 

» Risk aggregation: Central risk management aggregates
Group-wide risks and reports them to the Executive and
Supervisory Boards on a regular basis. 
» Risk treatment: Based on our risk management principles
and manual,  line management in cooperation with central risk
management and,  in exceptional cases,  the Executive Board
decides which risks we avoid,  reduce,  transfer or accept.  The
Group's financial risk management and hedging activities are
the responsibility of the central Treasury department and are
based on the Group's treasury policies (see Treasury,  p.  85).

External Risks
Macroeconomic Risks
Growth of the sporting goods industry is closely correlated to
consumer confidence and consumer spending.  Abrupt economic downturns,  in particular in regions where the Group
is highly represented,  therefore pose a significant shortterm risk to sales development.  To mitigate this risk,  it is the
Group's goal to have an even balance of sales amongst our
key regions.  In addition,  we have further reduced this risk by
extending our partnership and event portfolio to increase the
predictability of demand and make it less sensitive to macro­
economic influence.  In 2007,  the Group expects economic
growth in North America to moderate due to a decline in
private domestic demand (see Subsequent Events and Outlook,  p.  106).  The risk of an abrupt decline,  which we,  however,  believe has only a low likelihood,  could have a medium
adverse financial impact. 
Industry Risks
Price pressure and product discounting among sporting goods
retailers often as a result of industry consolidation can have a
negative impact on sporting goods manufacturers.  A sustained
promotional retail landscape in one of the Group's key markets can therefore threaten the Group's sales and profitability
development.  To moderate this risk,  we maintain a regionally
balanced sales mix and continually adapt the Group's distribution strategy.  The sporting goods industry currently faces a
highly promotional retail landscape in the UK.  Following three
years of declining average selling prices,  the adidas brand
initiated a new trade distribution policy effective January 12007.  This strategy offers our top product range only to retailers who satisfy trade policy requirements.  We accept the high
risk of a short-term sales loss,  which we expect to have a
visible impact on the European results of the adidas segment. 
However,  the Group projects only a low impact on the Group's
overall contribution in 2007.  Further,  we expect a beneficial
medium- and long-term effect on both Group sales and profitability as well as the UK market in general. 

Group Management Report  ›

Regulatory and Political Risks
The adidas Group faces risks arising from sudden significant
increases of import restrictions,  import tariffs and duties that
could compromise the free flow of goods within the Group
and from suppliers.  To limit these risks,  we utilize a broad
supplier base which allows us to shift production to other
countries at an early stage if necessary.  In October 2006the European Commission imposed anti-dumping duties on
leather shoes imported from China and Vietnam.  An important exception was made for technical athletic footwear which
represents the large majority of our product offering.  As a
result of this decision and the proactive diversification of our
sourcing portfolio (see Global Operations,  p.  60),  we expect
the new EU legislation to have an only very minor financial
effect on our Group in 2007.  We regard the medium-term risk
of further regulatory actions in other jurisdictions outside the
EU as having a low probability of occurrence and a medium
potential financial impact. 

› Risk Report 
Legal Risks
The adidas Group is exposed to the risk of claims and litigation from serious infringement of third party trademark and
patent rights.  To reduce risk,  new product technologies and
names are carefully researched to identify and avoid potential
conflicts with the rights of third parties.  In February 2006,  a
major competitor sued the adidas Group for an alleged breach
of patent rights regarding two footwear models.  However,  the
Group does not expect any material impact on its financial
situation from this or other pending lawsuits.  Further,  due to
the extensive safeguards in place,  we believe that the risk of
our Group seriously infringing third party trademark and patent rights,  which could generate a medium financial impacthas a low likelihood of occurrence. 
Risks from Product Counterfeiting
As popular consumer brands with technological and design
innovation as defining characteristics,  the Group's brands
are a frequent target for counterfeiting and imitation.  More
than 6 million counterfeit adidas Group products were seized
worldwide in 2006.  To reduce the loss of sales and the potential damage of reputation resulting from defective products
sold under our brand names,  the adidas Group utilizes extensive legal protection (generally through registration) and
works closely with law enforcement authorities,  investigators
and outside counsel.  Although we have stepped up measures
such as security labeling to control production with authorized suppliers,  continued development of these measures
is required.  We therefore regard the likelihood of sustained
counterfeiting as high in the short term.  However,  the impact
on our forecasted financial results is expected to remain at
 similar level compared to previous years,  which means its
potential to generate a visible contribution variance is low. 

099

Social and Environmental Risks
We have continuing responsibilities to our workers,  suppliers and the environment.  Malpractice in these areas can have
 significant impact on the reputation and operational efficiency of our Group and our suppliers.  To limit this risk,  we
have established workplace standards that suppliers must
meet before they can become our business partners (see

­ ustainability,  p.  63).  Internal inspections of supplier factories verified by extensive external audits are conducted regularly.  In the event of non-compliance with these workplace
standards,  we develop joint action plans and set deadlines for
compliance and further improvement.  When these deadlines
are not met,  business relations are terminated (see Sustainability,  p.  63 and www, adidas-Group, com/sustainability).  We
regard the risk of social and environmental malpractice as
likely in only isolated cases having a potentially low financial
impact. 

Financial Risks 
Natural Risks
The adidas Group is exposed to external risks such as natural disasters,  epidemics,  fire and accidents.  Further,  physical
damage to our own or our suppliers' premises,  production
units,  warehouses and stock in transit can lead to property
damage and business interruption.  These risks are mitigated by ample loss prevention measures such as working
with reliable suppliers and logistics providers who guarantee
high safety standards and disaster recovery plans.  In addition to the considerable insurance coverage we have securedthe Group has also implemented contingency plans to minimize potential negative effects.  As a result,  we expect an only
minor financial loss after insurance compensation should
natural risks materialize.  However,  we regard this scenario
as unlikely. 

Interest Rate Risks
Significant interest rate changes can have an adverse effect
on the Group's profitability,  liquidity and financial position. 
The acquisition of Reebok has led to an increase in interest
rate risks due to the higher financing requirements and the
resulting higher weighted average interest rate on the Group's
financing structure (see Treasury,  p.  85).  To moderate interest
rate risks,  floating-rate arrangements are partially protected
against short-term interest rate increases by corresponding
hedges such as fixed-rate interest rate swaps.  Additionally,  it
is part of our financial strategy to reduce the Group's financial
leverage to below 50% in the medium term.  We have strongly
reduced net debt following the financing of the Reebok acquisition and have increased the share of fixed-rate financing
arrangements.  As a result,  we estimate the likelihood of
interest rate risks,  which could have a medium effect on our
contribution in 2007 and the medium-term future,  as low. 

Currency Risks
Most of the Group's currency risks result from the fact that a
significant portion of our sourcing is done directly with suppliers in Asia (see Global Operations,  p.  60).  This means the
products are invoiced mainly in US dollars,  whereas our sales
to customers are denominated in multiple currencies such
as the euro,  the Japanese yen,  the Canadian dollar and the
British pound.  Therefore,  the Group is exposed to the risk
of exchange rate movements.  We manage the risk through
centralized currency risk management and hedging of the
Group's net US dollar deficit (see Treasury,  p.  85).  As we have
almost completed our anticipated hedging needs for 2007 at
rates slightly below those of 2006,  we believe the likelihood
that currency risks could have more than a low impact on our
2007 financial contribution is low. 

Investment Risks
In the past year,  the adidas Group has primarily used free cash
flow to reduce borrowings which increased by approximately
€ 3 billion upon the purchase of Reebok.  Therefore,  only a very
limited amount of cash is invested in investment funds (see
Note 7,  p.  157).  Risks related to a major decline in the value of
these funds are therefore negligible in terms of likelihood and
potential impact. 
Financing and Liquidity Risks
To meet our ongoing financing needs,  the adidas Group faces
the risk of having to accept unfavorable financing terms due
to liquidity constraints.  The Group,  however,  regards this risk
as limited as we have secured favorable conditions in the
financing arrangements for the Reebok acquisition.  As we
anticipate strong free cash flow generation in 2007,  we view
financing and liquidity risks as having both a low likelihood of
occurrence and low potential financial impact. 

100  Annual Report 2006  ›  adidas Group  ›

Strategic Risks
Portfolio Risks
The adidas Group faces risks due to contractual obligations
following business divestitures and with regard to the integration of newly acquired businesses.  In our ongoing initiatives to
integrate the Reebok brand,  we face a risk of overestimating potential revenue and cost synergies as well as execution
risks.  The latter relate for example to the harmonization of the
Group's IT systems and the standardization of functional business processes across the different brands.  To mitigate these
risks,  we have implemented a dedicated controlling function
and an integration management office continuously overseeing our integration activities.  The realization of the first projected cost synergies in 2006 gives us higher confidence in the
likelihood of achievement of our medium-term synergy targets (see Subsequent Events and Outlook,  p.  106).  In additionformal employee surveys conducted throughout 2006 as part
of our Reebok integration activities suggest high satisfaction
rates and a positive cultural fit between employees at each
of our brands (see Employees,  p.  65).  We therefore believe
there is a low likelihood of portfolio risk occurrence.  Due to
the magnitude of projected synergies,  however,  we regard the
potential financial impact of these risks as high. 
Risks from Loss of Key Promotion Partnerships
The adidas Group faces risks from the loss of major promotion
partnerships which play an important role in building brand
image and generating sales of licensed product.  To mitigate
the inherent risk,  we follow the strategy of broadening the
Group's portfolio of premium partnerships in order to reduce
the reliance on single affiliations.  As a result,  we assess the
potential financial impact of this risk to be low,  whereas the
likelihood of occurrence is medium. 

Group Management Report  ›

Brand Image Risks
 shift in consumer taste away from performance products
could adversely affect our Group as our product portfolio is
weighted towards performance-oriented styles.  We mitigate
this risk by following a multi-brand strategy with brands that
address distinct performance-oriented consumer segments
as well as product offerings targeting lifestyle-oriented

­ onsumers.  Nonetheless,  a significant restriction in the
usage of the Three Stripes symbol in sport competition,  for
example,  could potentially harm our brand recognition value
and negatively affect the image of brand adidas.  We have mitigated this risk with the successful negotiation of long-term
solutions with the sport federations most important for us
during the last two years.  We hence regard the likelihood of
further restrictions in the usage of the Three Stripes,  which
could potentially have a significant financial impact,  as low. 
Research and Development Risks
In the sporting goods industry,  the speed with which new
product technologies are brought to market is decisive.  If the
adidas Group failed to constantly develop innovative products,  we would risk a significant sales decline as innovative
products generate strong sales and more importantly create
 halo effect for other products.  Due to our industry-leading
innovational strength (see Research and Development,  p.  69)we assess the occurrence probability of this risk,  which could
potentially have a significant financial impact,  as low. 
Product Quality Risks
The adidas Group faces a risk of selling defective productwhich may result in injury to consumers and image impairment.  We mitigate this risk through rigorous testing prior to
production,  close cooperation with manufacturers throughout
the fabrication process,  open communication about defective
products and quick settlement of product liability claims if
necessary.  The financial consequences of potential product
liability cases,  whose likelihood of occurrence we regard as
low,  could have a medium impact. 

› Risk Report 
Own-Retail Risks
New adidas,  Reebok and Rockport own-retail stores require
considerable up-front investment in furniture and fittings as
well as ongoing maintenance.  In addition,  own-retail activities
often require longer-term lease or rent commitments as well
as significantly more personnel in relation to net sales than
our wholesale business.  This comparably less flexible cost
structure implies a risk in cases of significant unexpected
sales declines,  as such declines cannot be immediately compensated by cost reductions.  The Group minimizes this risk by
only entering into lease contracts with a duration of less than
ten years.  In addition,  all shops must fulfill ambitious profitability targets dependent on size,  location and investment in
the store.  If these targets are not met,  we undertake restructuring measures and eventually close unprofitable locations. 
We assess own-retail risks as medium with regard to their
likelihood of occurrence,  but low in terms of their potential
extent of loss. 
Personnel Risks
The adidas Group's future success is highly dependent on our
employees and their talents.  We thus face the risk of being
unable to identify,  recruit and retain the most talented people
that best meet the specific needs of our Group.  To reduce the
risk of not being able to recruit qualified staff,  to enable our
employees to make use of their full potential and to retain
key personnel,  we strongly engage in developing a motivating working environment,  attractive reward and incentive
schemes as well as long-term career opportunities to make
the adidas Group the employer of choice within our industry
(see Employees,  p.  65).  As a result,  we regard the likelihood of
occurrence of these risks,  which could have a medium financial impact should they materialize,  as limited. 

101

Operational Risks
Sourcing Risks
Raw material and labor costs account for approximately 80%
of the Group's cost of sales.  Hence,  the adidas Group faces
risks from significant increases of these costs and also
from business interruptions at one of our major supplierswhich would have a material impact on the Group's ability
to meet short-term customer demand.  For example,  financial ­difficulties and subsequent closure of three factories in
Indonesia supplying footwear to Reebok reduced the Group's
net income by around € 8 million in 2006.  To mitigate the risk
of higher sourcing costs,  we exploit economies of scale from
our higher sourcing volume following the Reebok acquisition.  To reduce the risk of business interruptions,  we work
with vendors who demonstrate reliability,  quality,  innovation
and continuous improvement.  By doing so,  we are confident
that our strategic supply partners will be most competitive
in the medium and long term in offsetting price increases.  In
addition,  we pursue a regionally balanced sourcing strategy
and collaborate closely with our vendors in search of newinnovative materials.  As a result,  we assess sourcing risks as
having a medium likelihood of occurrence and a low potential
financial loss. 

Customer Risks
Customer risks arise from our dependence on key customers who could exert bargaining power resulting in considerable margin pressure and product cancellations.  To limit this
risk,  the adidas Group has a broad distribution strategy.  As a
result,  no customer at brands adidas,  Reebok and TaylorMade
accounted for more than 10% of brand sales in 2006.  Furtherfollowing the Reebok acquisition,  we are actively reducing the
brand's dependence on key accounts by strengthening our
business in the sporting goods and athletic specialty retail
channels.  A strong reduction of business with one of our
brands' biggest retailers,  which we regard as unlikely,  could
nonetheless adversely impact regional sales and profitability
to a medium extent. 
IT Risks
 Group-wide breakdown of IT systems or a significant loss of
data could result in considerable disruptions to our business. 
In order to mitigate these risks,  we perform scheduled backups and engage in proactive maintenance.  System security
and reliability are tested via internal tests and external audits
on a regular basis.  Periodic reviews of the Group's systems
architecture ensure that the Group meets changing business requirements and fulfills the highest safety standards. 
In 2006,  the downtime of our major IT applications was well
below 1% of total running time.  This gives us confidence in
the assessment of IT risks as having a low likelihood of occurrence,  but a significant potential financial impact. 

Overall Risk
Central risk management aggregates all risks reported by
brand,  regional and headquarter functions.  Based on the compilation of risks explained within this report and the ­current
business outlook,  adidas Group Management does not foresee any individual or aggregate risks which could materially
jeopardize the ongoing business health and viability of the
Group.  In comparison to the prior year,  portfolio and ownretail risks increased in importance due to the magnitude
of expected synergies from the Reebok integration and the
higher share of own-retail activities at brand adidas.  Howeverfinancing and brand image risks have become less prevalent
as we have completed the financing of the Reebok transaction and now have a broader portfolio of brands addressing
distinct consumer groups.  As a result,  management regards
the Group's overall risk exposure as largely unchanged.  This
assessment is supported by the continued positive responses
to our financing demands,  as in 2006 the adidas Group issued
several private placements in various regions and currencies
that were all oversubscribed (see Treasury,  p.  85).  The adidas
Group therefore has not sought an official rating by one of
the leading rating agencies.  We believe that the Group's earning power forms a solid basis for our future business development.  As outlined above,  we have taken appropriate precautions against typical business risks that could negatively
affect our financial standing and profitability situation.

Opportunities Report
As a leader in the sporting goods industry,  our Group
is ­exposed to a global marketplace,  offering significant
growth and profitability potential for all our brands. 

­ dentifying,  assessing and exploiting opportunities in a
structured and organized way is fundamental to achieving our medium- and long-term revenue and profitability
goals.  In addition to seizing opportunities evolving from
macroeconomic and industry developments,  we continuously strive to deliver strategic initiatives at a Group and
brand level in order to capture future growth and profitability. 

Group Management Report  ›

Opportunities Management Principles and Process
All facets of our organization are involved as we continuously
seek to maximize the top line and optimize our cost structure. 
Centralized Group and brand functions such as planningmarketing,  finance,  treasury,  global operations,  and mergers and acquisitions,  are responsible for anticipating global
macroeconomic,  industry and long-term strategic options. 
Brand teams at both global and regional levels are focused
on identifying consumer trends and monitoring developments
in the respective markets.  Strategic business plans provide
the overall direction towards the realization and execution
of opportunities.  Our opportunities management process is
composed of the following steps:
»  Opportunity identification: Situation analysis is the most
important process we apply in identifying and quantifying
opportunities.  We conduct our own qualitative research with
respect to macroeconomic and consumer trends,  but also
consult secondary material and liaise with independent trend
and media agencies.  In addition,  we analyze market data to
see which markets,  categories,  consumer target groups and
product styles show potential for future growth.  We actively
monitor brand,  distribution channel and price point developments.  Our primary focus is on sport,  but increasingly we also
look at adjacent market segments such as leisure lifestyle
and sport fusion. 

›  Opportunities Report 
»  Opportunity assessment: Identified opportunities undergo
 rigorous evaluation,  to ascertain viability,  commercialitycontribution and risk.  This approach is applied to both longerterm strategic prospects but also shorter-term tactical and
opportunistic initiatives at both a Group and brand level.  Each
opportunity that we choose to pursue must adhere to the core
values of the Group and respective brand,  and provide a significant direct or indirect revenue and profitability contribution while meeting stringent cost and investment criteria. 
»  Opportunity monitoring and controlling: Measuring the
success of our initiatives is a crucial aspect of the opportunity management process.  The objectives and key performance indicators set during the identification and evaluation
process are monitored on an ongoing basis.  This not only
facilitates the validation of opportunities but also allows us to
adapt and refine our products,  communication and distribution strategy to ongoing developments in our fast-moving and
rapidly changing marketplace.  We are also placing increased
emphasis on engaging with our manufacturing partners and
retail customers to evaluate the impact of our growth and
cost initiatives.  During the monitoring and controlling process,  information is relayed in a timely manner to productmarketing and controlling functions.  Management is continuously updated as part of the Strategic Business Plan processand through regular and ad hoc discussions as appropriate.

Macro- and Socioeconomic Opportunities
Macro-Environment and Fiscal Policy Changes
Interest rate changes,  tax reforms and currency exchange
rate developments regularly provide opportunities for optimization.  Our central Group Treasury and Tax departments
constantly monitor these developments to identify potential
opportunities to reduce our non-operating expenses. 
Emerging Markets as Long-Term Growth Drivers
Emerging economies in Asia,  Europe and Latin America offer
significant potential to our Group.  Of particular importance
to our Group are China,  Russia and India.  Given the positive
market signals and our future plans for distribution roll-out
in these regions,  we expect sales from emerging markets
to grow to more than 30% over the next five to ten years
(2006: 19%).  Above-average GDP growth,  rising real incomes
and employment rates as well as positive demographic trends
and an increasing middle class continue to fuel these economies and subsequently our industry.  The adidas Group,  in particular the adidas brand,  is well positioned to exploit growth
in these regions due to our leading positions,  excellent sponsoring partnerships and our extensive distribution network. 
To exploit these opportunities further,  we continue to utilize
and grow our own-retail activities to capture growth where
traditional distribution channels remain underdeveloped.  At
brand Reebok,  we have taken several important steps during
the first year of integration,  most notably acquiring the distribution rights to the brand in several of these markets such
as China,  Russia,  Czech Republic,  Slovakia and Turkey.  For
TaylorMade-adidas Golf,  the emerging markets of Asia also
present the largest growth opportunities,  due to the relatively
low participation rates in golf at present.  As accessibility to
the game grows,  the popularity of golf continues to rises
­ purring increased demand for golf products. 

Increasing Sports Participation Rates in Mature Markets
In mature markets such as Western Europe and North
­America,  an ageing population and increasing obesity rates
are having a significant effect on health care costs.  Government and non-profit organization involvement is steadily

­ ising on this issue,  with initiatives such as P. H. I. T.  (Personal
Health Investment Today) being reintroduced to US congress
in January 2007.  The already high awareness in the media and
among the general public is expected to increase further in
the medium term.  As society is encouraged to live ­healthiersports participation is projected to increase providing a growth
opportunity for our industry.  Given our strong position across
 wide range of performance sports disciplines,  we believe
this will help our Group outperform industry growth in these
countries over the medium term.

Industry Opportunities
Fast-Growing Women's Segment
The women's sports market is the fastest-growing segment in the sporting goods industry with women accounting
for more than half of total spending on athletic footwear.  In
addition,  women also make approximately 80% of the buying
decisions for sports apparel for men,  women and children. 
Reebok already has a high recognition with the female consumer,  with a market-leading position in aerobic footwear. 
Similarly,  the adidas brand has built strong recognition in
two of the most lucrative women's sports segments,  namely
sport-specific performance products and designer fashion
products through our collaborations with Stella McCartney
and Yohji Yamamoto,  respectively.  TaylorMade-adidas Golf is
also benefiting from higher participation rates by women in
golf,  launching several products featuring lighter weights and
shorter shafts targeted specifically at female golfers.  To harvest future growth potential in this segment,  the focus of all
our brands is to extend and broaden our product offering to
meet the needs of the women's market which is characteristically driven by individuality,  authenticity and style. 
Increasing Focus on Kids
The kids' segment has also been identified as a key focus for
the Group in the medium term.  Our kids' business has experienced strong growth in recent years,  but there is still further opportunity to expand our market presence,  especially
in the North American and Asian markets.  We currently offer
 wider selection of products than ever before to address
the specific needs of children.  In the past year,  adidas and
Reebok have partnered with premier toy and entertainment
companies such as Mattel and Hasbro in an effort to create
innovative product collections for our younger consumers.  We
are also investing more at the grass roots level to capture a
larger share of the kids' market and to help create a strong
association between our brands and sports at an early age. 
Kids represent an important current and future target group
for many sports categories.  As a result,  we will continue to
focus on and invest in this critical segment of the business. 

Group Management Report  ›

Building Market Share in High-Growth Sports Categories
Expanding in emerging categories where our brands have
been under-represented is another source of growth we
seek to exploit as our brands evolve.  Skate,  sport fusion
and outdoor are all rapidly-growing categories,  where we
are increasing our efforts.  Skateboarding footwear was the
fastest-growing category in the United States in 2006 and is
now the fifth largest.  Sport fusion,  where fashion and lifestyle
footwear and apparel derive their characteristics from sportspecific features,  continues to evolve,  with new inspiration
coming from categories such as gym,  yoga and martial arts. 
Outdoor activities such as Nordic walking,  hiking,  free running and trail running are also high-growth sports categories.  Our market share in each of these segments is below
10%,  providing significant potential going forward.  Over the
next three years,  we intend to launch several new initiatives
in these categories,  utilizing the full power and capability of
our development and design teams. 
Running Category To Grow Further
Running continues to be extremely popular,  but running
demographics are changing,  with high growth rates among
both female and older athletes.  People are now taking up
running for varied purposes,  from weight loss and stress
reduction to participating in competitive runs.  Participation
rates in running are expected to grow further and as we are
under-represented in this category,  we see significant growth
potential.  As we look to the future,  the demand for functional
footwear and apparel is expected to increase overproportionately in what is already sport's largest product category.  We
believe we can outperform market growth and increase our
market share through a strong innovation pipeline.  With our
multi-brand approach,  we will be able to address the running market in a more meaningful way,  tailoring each brand's
proposition to more effectively target the diverse consumer
base. 

›  Opportunities Report 
Technology to Drive Growth of Customized Products
We expect the market for customized footwear,  apparel and
hardware to grow strongly in the coming years.  Consumers
are increasingly looking for products that more ­ precisely
meet their individual needs and go beyond just ­ aesthetic

­ ppearance.  adidas,  Reebok and TaylorMade all offer ­different
customization platforms reflecting the respective brand's
strategy.  Two examples for how we are attacking this opportunity are the introduction of adidas1 and the adidas 'mi
Innovation ­Center".  With the launch of the first 'intelligent"
products such as the adidas1 running and basketball shoes
in 2005 and 2006,  respectively,  we established the adidas
brand as the pioneer when it comes to customized footwear technologies.  In 2006,  we introduced the first-of-a-kind
interactive retail concept,  the adidas 'mi Innovation Center". 

­ tilizing advanced technology,  we can deliver footwear product incorporating our top innovations based on the personal fit
and performance needs of individual consumers.  We believe
the 'mi Innovation Center" offers a new shopping experience
for consumers and thus we plan to open additional centers
around the world over the next few years.  Going forward,  we
will continuously strive to extend our customization initiatives
across all brands to further develop this emerging market. 

105

Strategic Opportunities
Multi-Brand Approach Provides Competitive Advantage
We believe there is a natural limit a brand can achieve given
the diverse tastes and expectations of a highly fragmented
consumer market.  Our multi-brand approach provides us
with a major competitive advantage and significant additional commercial opportunities compared to a single brand

­ trategy.  We can leverage the power of our brands in a more
precise and meaningful way,  utilizing the combined strengths
of each to compete for a higher percentage of the marketcovering a greater number of consumer needs,  price points
and demographics. 
Greater Connection to the Consumer at Point-of-Sale
We believe there are significant opportunities to improve the
presentation of our brands at point-of-sale.  This will not only
enhance our bond with the consumer,  but also help to increase
the efficiency and profitability of our retail partners.  Through
closer cooperation,  we can significantly improve the in-store
experience for our product.  Establishing shop-in-shop formats (e.g.  with JJB and Dick's Sporting Goods) or retail partnerships (e.g.  with INTERSPORT) are examples where we are
leading the industry.  Through initiatives like these,  we can
achieve more innovative product presentation,  targeted ideas
and messages,  as well as training of sales staff.  We believe
such cooperations can be particularly effective in markets
that have become dominated by price and lack of differentiation.  With the vast experience we have gained from our ownretail activities,  we intend to transfer best practices to these
and similar formats in the future. 

Promotion Partnerships Bring Authenticity
The importance of brand affiliation with premium partnerships is crucial to demonstrate authenticity,  credibility and
support innovation.  We have an enviable portfolio of partnership assets including major events (e.g.  UEFA EURO 2008™2008 Beijing Olympics,  FIFA World Cup 2010™),  leagues
(e.g.  NBA,  NFL,  NHL and MLS),  teams (e.g.  Real MadridC
­ helsea FC,  AC Milan,  FC Bayern Munich) and individual athletes.  Promotion partnerships are an important vehicle for our
Group,  generating significant revenue opportunities through
product lines launched in cooperation with our partners,  as
well as enhancing the Group's brand image.  Our broad platform of partners provides our Group with significant visibility
and predictability for future revenue generation.  We continue
to search for new opportunities to strengthen our portfolio of
high-profile teams,  athletes and sports associations.  We look
for premium partners that positively and uniquely showcase
our brand values and have high visibility with key consumer
groups.  A core tenet of the selection process is that partnerships will enable us to generate a strong direct or indirect
return on investment.  This underpins our positive expectations for the future in particularly iconic sports such as football,  basketball,  tennis and golf. 

Realizing Synergies from Reebok Integration
The acquisition of Reebok has created new business opportunities for our Group.  As we already possess strong market
positioning and expertise outside of North America,  ­Reebok's
assets,  including the exclusive license contracts with the
NFL,  NHL and MLB,  will be leveraged beyond Reebok's
core US and UK markets to drive incremental sales for the
Group.  We also have significant opportunities to reduce and
optimize costs,  through scale benefits,  back office consolidation and combined capital expenditure planning.  In total,  we
have identified € 500 million in incremental annual revenue
synergies and € 175 million in annual net cost synergies for
the adidas Group from the acquisition which we intend to fully
deliver from 2009 onwards (see Subsequent Events and Outlook,  p.  106). 
Cost Optimization To Improve Profitability
As in any organization,  cost optimization and control are
crucial to achieving high profitability levels and return on
invested capital.  Although we have made important progress
in recent years,  our profit margins are still below those of our
main competitors.  Given the scope of our organization,  we
see significant potential to further optimize our cost driversenhance profitability and reduce our working capital requirements.  We also see opportunities to optimize our cost base
by continuously reducing complexity and increasing efficiency
in our supply chain.  By being closer to the market with bestselling product,  extending lean manufacturing,  and creating
 truly end-to-end supply chain,  we strive to achieve this cost
savings potential.  Our 'World Class Supply Chain" initiative is
 cornerstone in seizing the cost optimization opportunities
(see Global Operations,  p.  60). 

106  Annual Report 2006  ›  adidas Group  ›

Subsequent Events
and Outlook
2007 is strategically an important year for the adidas
Group.  Revitalizing Reebok will be at the forefront of our
endeavors,  and the first product initiatives developed

­ nder the leadership of our new brand management
team will be launched in the second half of the year.  We
will ­continue to realize integration synergies and further
increase cost optimization throughout our organization. 
Based on our extensive product pipeline and strong marketing initiatives for all our brands,  we are confident that
we will again be able to deliver strong top- and bottomline performance this year,  and improve our key balance
sheet metrics.  For the adidas Group,  we expect to grow
currency-neutral sales at a mid-single-digit rate,  driven by
growth at all our brands and in all our regions.  In addition,  we project increases in both our gross and operating
margins,  which will be between 45 and 47% and around 9%respectively.  Further,  we forecast net income attributable
to shareholders to grow by double-digit rates approaching
15%.  We believe the current trading environment supports our expectations given positive growth projections
for our industry and the global economy.  No material event
between the end of 2006 and the publication of this report
has altered our view. 

Group Management Report  ›

Subsequent Macroeconomic Developments
Since the end of 2006,  there have been no major macroeconomic or sociopolitical changes which we expect to influence
our business materially going forward. 
Subsequent Group Events
Buying out distributors and joint ventures around the globe
underscores our Group's strategy to support our brands with
wholly-owned subsidiaries in key markets.  Consequently,  on
January 12,  2007,  we announced the buyback of distribution
rights for the Reebok brand in Turkey from RBK Spor ­Urunleri. 
Effective April 1,  2007,  adidas Spor Malzemeleri Satis ve

­ azarlama A. S.  will become the exclusive distributor of
Reebok products in Turkey.  In addition,  after the contract with
­Reebok's distribution partner in Chile had expired on December 31,  2006,  adidas Chile Ltda.  became the exclusive distributor of Reebok products in Chile effective January 1,  2007. 
Subsequent Changes in the Group's Legal Structure
The Hockey Company was renamed Reebok-CCM HockeyInc.,  in January 2007.  We believe this new name better reflects
the company's focus on two key separate and distinct brands:
Rbk Hockey and CCM Hockey. 
Subsequent Management Changes
In January 2007,  the adidas Group made three key appointments at adidas and Reebok regional management levels. 
At adidas,  Patrik Nilsson was appointed President of adidas
North America.  At Reebok,  Nigel Griffiths was named Head
of Reebok Europe and Dave Mischler Head of Reebok Asia
Pacific.  In February 2007,  it was announced that Bernd Wahler
would become Chief Marketing Officer Sport Performance for
the adidas brand. 
Subsequent Financing Developments
With regard to financing,  there have been no major developments since the end of 2006. 

›  Subsequent Events and Outlook 
Subsequent Share Count Changes
As a result of stock options exercised as part of various
tranches of the Management Share Option Plan (MSOP) of
adidas AG,  the number of outstanding shares increased by
30200 to 203567060 no-par value shares in January 2007. 
Subsequent Legal Changes
The adidas Group has taken the necessary steps to comply with all new and changed regulations introduced by the
Transparency Directive Implementation Act (Transparenzricht­
linien-Umsetzungsgesetz TUG) and the Act on Electronic
Commercial Registers,  Cooperative Society Registers and
the Company Register (Gesetz über elektronische Handels­
register und Genossenschaftsregister sowie das Unternehmensregister EHUG) in January 2007.  Accordingly,  we will
among other things disclose ad hoc notifications,  directors'
dealings,  changes in the percentage of voting rights and
financial reports throughout Europe and provide them to the
Company Register for central storage of information relevant
for capital markets. 
adidas Backlogs Grow Moderately
Backlogs for the adidas brand at the end of 2006 increased
1% versus the prior year on a currency-neutral basis.  This
represents a decrease of 4% in euro terms.  Footwear backlogs declined 1% in currency-neutral terms (– 6% in euros). 
Softness in several categories in North America and Europe
was largely offset by growth across all major categories in
Asia.  Apparel backlogs grew 5% on a currency-neutral basis
(stable in euros),  driven by improvements in the Sport Performance training and basketball categories.  Hardware
backlogs,  particularly in Europe,  negatively affected growth
rates due to declines in the football category.  The transfer of
the NBA and Liverpool licensed businesses from Reebok to
adidas had a positive impact of approximately 1 percentage
point on the development of brand adidas backlogs.

Backlogs at Reebok Brand Improve Sequentially
Backlogs for the Reebok brand at the end of 2006 decreased
12% versus the prior year on a currency-neutral basis,  showing a sequential improvement from the prior quarter.  In euro
terms,  this represents a decline of 18%.  Footwear backlogs
declined 15% in currency-neutral terms (– 21% in euros)mainly due to decreases in Reebok's lifestyle offering in North
America.  Apparel backlogs were down 9% on a currencyneutral basis (–14% in euros) as a result of a decline in both
Reebok's licensed and branded apparel business,  particularly in North America.  The transfer of the NBA and Liverpool
licensed businesses from Reebok to adidas also negatively
affected apparel backlogs development.  Excluding the effects
of this transfer,  total Reebok backlogs decreased 10% on a
currency-neutral basis. 
Positive Retail Feedback for TaylorMade-adidas Golf
Because of the different order profile in golf compared to other
parts of our business,  we do not provide order information for
TaylorMade-adidas Golf.  However,  trade show performance
and ongoing dialog with customers supports continued positive development of the segment.

Major Factors Impacting 2007 Results
Several factors will impact our consolidated results in 2007. 
In 2006,  the Reebok business segment was included in our
financial results for the 11-month period from February
to December.  In 2007,  the inclusion of one extra month is
expected to have a positive low-single-digit percentage point
impact on Reebok's reported full year sales growth.  Furtheron November 21,  2006,  we announced the completion of the
divestiture of the Greg Norman Collection (GNC) wholesale
business.  The GNC wholesale business was consolidated in
the TaylorMade-adidas Golf segment until the end of November 2006.  The results of the GNC-related retail outlet operations,  which were not part of the transaction,  will be reported
as part of Reebok's own-retail activities from January 1,  2007. 
Sales recorded in the HQ/Consolidation segment will remain
at a high level during 2007,  as a result of the Group's cooperation agreement with Amer Sports Corporation.  Under this
agreement,  the adidas Group sources softgoods for Salomon
at a fixed buying commission for a limited period in an effort to
support the transfer of Salomon's business activities to Amer
Sports Corporation.  However,  this agreement includes margins significantly below the Group's average and therefore will
continue to negatively impact the Group's gross and operating
margin in 2007.  Finally,  the purchase of the remaining 49% of
shares from the joint venture partner of the adidas subsidiary
in Korea,  effective September 1,  2006,  will significantly lower
minority interests in 2007. 

Group Management Report  ›

Global Economy Positive but Modest Slowdown
With a projected GDP growth rate of around 3% for 2007growth of the global economy is expected to moderate versus 2006.  European GDP growth is expected to slow slightly to
levels of around 2% in 2007.  This should be more pronounced
in the first half of the year due to slower world trade growtha stronger euro,  higher short-term interest rates,  and fiscal tightening such as the VAT increase in Germany.  Current
signals in North America indicate a more mixed economic
development in 2007 than in 2006.  GDP growth is projected to
ease over the prior year to around 25%.  Concerns regarding
the real estate sector persist and the possible repercussions
on construction activity,  consumer demand,  financial markets and world trade growth remain a risk.  However,  against
such a backdrop,  inflationary pressures are likely to fade and
the Federal Reserve is expected to start a phase of interest
rate cutting.  The outlook for Asia and Latin America remains
strong.  Growth in the emerging markets of Asia,  in particular
China and India,  will be the largest contributor to global development in 2007.  Compared to 2006,  growth in Asia excluding
Japan should moderate only slightly and continue to be at
levels of around 7%.  For Japan,  growth is expected to slow
to a level of no more than 2%.  Sound corporate earnings,  rising employment and encouraging export signals are expected
to be tempered by a weakening in domestic demand leading
to lackluster consumer spending.  Growth in Latin America is
likely to remain at similar levels compared to the prior year
(around 4%).  As in previous years,  private consumption as
well as buoyant exports will drive economic growth. 

›  Subsequent Events and Outlook 
Mixed Outlook for Sporting Goods Industry
The global sporting goods industry is expected to grow
modestly in 2007.  We expect the European market to grow
at low-single-digit rates.  In the first half year,  in particularthe industry will face the challenge of compensating for the
boost provided last year by the 2006 FIFA World Cup™,  which
took place in Germany.  In addition,  the warm winter will
negatively impact sales development in the industry.  Tough
retail market conditions in Western Europe are also likely
to continue.  Especially in the UK,  and to a lesser extent in
France,  the sporting goods retail market remains very competitive and promotional.  For the North American sporting
goods market,  we project low-­single-digit growth in 2007. 
The mixed development of product categories in the second
half of 2006,  particularly the sales declines in basketball and
classics,  compounded by varied performance among retail
channels,  is expected to continue in 2007.  Promotional activity among mall-based retailers and a polarization of price
points are likely to further burden market development. 
Further,  we expect the golf market in North America to be
highly competitive in 2007 as many market participants are
introducing new technologies in the metalwoods category.  In
Asia,  the sporting goods market is forecasted to continue its
expansion and grow at high-single-digit rates.  In Japan,  the
sporting goods market is expected to remain highly competitive,  as weak overall private consumption may affect average
selling prices in the sector.  But in the rest of Asia,  the industry is likely to grow at low-double-digit levels,  most notably
in China.  Mid-single-digit industry growth rates are expected
in Latin ­America.  The momentum of the region's sporting
goods industry is projected to remain intact,  but import duties
and quotas are increasingly limiting cross-border transfer of
goods and forcing suppliers to produce locally.

Emerging Markets to Drive adidas Group Sales
Based on our strength in innovation,  operational excellence
and regional diversification,  we are confident that the Group's
net sales increase in 2007 will again exceed growth rates of
the global economy.  We also expect Group sales growth to
be at least in line with the overall development of the sporting goods sector.  Revenues will grow in all regions,  yielding
another record year in sales.  In particular,  sales in Asia and
Latin America are expected to grow at double-digit rates in
currency-neutral terms,  above both economic and industry
development,  due to our strong brand recognition and growing distribution infrastructure.  Low-single-digit growth rates
are expected in Europe and North America due to difficult
comparables,  slower economic development and intensified
competition at retail. 
Stronger Sales Momentum in Second Half of 2007
We expect revenue growth to be weighted towards the second
half of 2007 owing to difficult comparisons in the first half of
the year.  This is a result of the strong growth in all regions
in the prior year and the positive sales impact from adidas'
strong presence around the 2006 FIFA World Cup™.  Growth
rates in the second half of 2007 are expected to acceleratedriven by our product launch schedule. 

Mid-Single-Digit Sales Growth Expected at Brand adidas
We project mid-single-digit currency-neutral sales growth for
adidas in 2007.  All three adidas divisions are expected to grow
with the strongest improvements anticipated in the Sport

­ erformance running,  women's and basketball categoriessupported by our fully-integrated 'Impossible is Nothing"
brand campaign.  We have a compelling pipeline of product
launches in running,  including additions to our core adiStarSuperNova and Response families featuring our ­ForMotion™
technology as well as the next generation of our BOUNCE™
running shoes.  We also expect substantial growth in our women's business led by our collaboration with Stella McCartney
and the continued momentum of our Adilibria concept.  We
will also launch our most innovative functional line of performance apparel to date,  the adidas TechFit™ Powerweb.  For
Europe and North America,  own-retail and at-once businesswhich are not included in order backlogs,  will be positive topline growth drivers.  However,  our new distribution policy in
the UK announced in 2006 to improve the positioning of our
product at retail will temper European development.  In Asiawe are again targeting significant sales growth for brand
adidas in 2007,  mainly driven by strong increases in ChinaKorea and Southeast Asia.  In Latin America,  year-end customer feedback points to continued solid growth prospects
for 2007.

Modest Sales Growth Expected for Reebok Segment
Reported sales are expected to grow at low-single-digit ratespositively impacted by the consolidation of one extra month in
2007 (low-single-digit percentage point impact),  compared to
the prior year,  and the inclusion of GNC-related retail operations which were reported as part of TaylorMade-adidas Golf
in 2006.  Our focus on improving Reebok's position in performance sports will be driven by several product launches in
both footwear and apparel.  Running will be a key focus with
the launch of our 'Run Easy" marketing campaign and new
products such as the Trinity KFS II,  PUMP Paris Trainer and
HATANA (see Campaigns and Products,  p.  117).  In apparel,  we
plan several performance launches in American sports such
as the NFL Zero Degrees collection and the Rbk EDGE Uniform System™,  which has been designed in collaboration with
NHL players.  Our efforts to broaden our Lifestyle offering will
also become more visible with the launch of Scarlett 'Hearts"
Rbk as well as the 25th anniversary of our famous Freestyle
workout shoe.  We also expect a positive sales development at
Rockport,  supported by the first product lines to incorporate
adidas Torsion® technology that will be launched during the
second half of 2007.  For 2007,  we expect the Reebok brand to
continue to show solid gains in emerging markets,  particularly in Asia.  We also anticipate a positive sales development
in Europe and Latin America,  which will be largely offset by
weakness in North America. 

Group Management Report  ›

Mid-Single-Digit Sales Growth for TaylorMade-adidas Golf
As a result of our strong product pipeline,  we are confident
that in 2007,  currency-neutral TaylorMade-adidas Golf sales
will grow at mid-single-digit rates on a like-for-like basis. 
However,  due to the divestiture of the GNC wholesale business at the end of November and the transfer of the remaining GNC-related retail operations to Reebok effective January 1,  2007,  reported sales for TaylorMade-adidas Golf may
decline in 2007 compared to the prior year.  Growth will mainly
be driven by new products such as the r7® SuperQuad drivers,  plus the new Burner® family of metalwoods.  At adidas
Golf,  we expect solid growth rates to continue with strong
new concepts in both footwear and apparel.  In footwear,  we
are launching a new performance shoe,  POWERBAND,  which
incorporates three sophisticated adidas Golf technologies
and the Tour 360 II,  a new version of the enormously successful Tour 360.  The Clima® concept will be further extended to
shorts and pants in adidas Golf apparel as well as several
launches in the women's segment.  New product extensions
and marketing initiatives are also planned in the golf ball category particularly at Maxfli,  where we will launch the Maxfli
Tour Fire and Maxfli Fire golf balls. 

›  Subsequent Events and Outlook 
Group Gross Margin to Improve Strongly
In 2007,  the adidas Group gross margin is expected to increase
strongly and be in a range of between 45 and 47%,  driven by
improvements in all three brand segments.  In particularwe will realize a significant positive impact on gross margin
at brand Reebok,  due to the non-recurrence of accounting
effects related to purchase price allocation (see Group Business Performance,  p.  72).  In 2006,  this non-cash accounting
charge negatively impacted Reebok's gross profit by € 76 million.  On a like-for-like basis,  we also expect an improvement
in gross margin at Reebok due to lower clearance activities
and an improving product mix.  In 2007,  we do not expect significant effects on our gross margin from higher input prices
or currency movements.  Increases in raw material and labor
costs will be offset by efficiency gains in production and
higher volumes.  Due to our hedging ­policy,  currency is likely
to have a modestly negative impact on gross margin in the
first six months,  offset by more favorable hedging rates over
the balance of the year.  Finally,  Group gross margin will continue to be negatively affected by our cooperation agreement
with Amer Sports Corporation. 

111

Operating Margin to Show Slight Improvement
In 2007,  we expect an operating margin for the adidas Group
of around 9%,  which will be modestly higher than in 2006. 
Gross margin improvements at all brands will drive this
development,  largely offset by higher operating expenses at
Reebok,  TaylorMade-adidas Golf and within HQ/Consolidation.  At Reebok,  this increase is mainly due to the € 50 million
of additional spend we announced in November 2006 necessary to accelerate the return to growth of the Reebok brand. 
These costs are primarily related to advertising,  product
development and own-retail expansion in the emerging markets.  In addition,  effects from purchase price allocation (in an
expected amount of between € 10 million and € 20 million)
will negatively impact Reebok's operating margin in 2007.  At
TaylorMade-adidas Golf,  operating expenses as a percentage
of net sales are expected to increase slightly as a result of
 higher marketing working budget to support new product
initiatives,  and operating profit will also be modestly affected
as a result of the divestiture of the GNC wholesale business. 
HQ/Consolidation will show a higher loss in 2007 compared
to the prior year due to increased integration costs related to
Reebok,  in line with our plan to realize synergies. 
Net Income Growth for the adidas Group to Approach 15%
We expect net income attributable to shareholders for the
adidas Group to grow at double-digit rates,  approaching 15%
versus the 2006 level of € 483 million and outpacing sales
development.  This represents the seventh consecutive year
of double-digit net income growth.  Top-line improvement
and increased profitability will be the primary drivers of this
positive development.  In addition,  we expect lower interest
expenses as a result of a reduction in average debt to have
 positive impact on net income,  partially offset by a higher
tax rate versus the prior year.  The higher tax rate is a consequence of the non-recurrence of one-time tax benefits we
realized in the fourth quarter of 2006.

Continued Supply Chain Improvements in Global Operations
In 2007,  we will continue our efforts to increase operational
efficiency throughout the Group's supply chain.  The integration of Reebok has already brought several benefits to our
business.  The 'World Class Buyer" program,  initiated in 2006
to maximize purchasing leverage across all our brands,  will
continue to provide cost of sales improvements.  We will build
on our 'World Class Supply Chain" initiative eliminating time
and cost,  getting closer to the market and ensuring we miss
no appropriate market opportunities (see Global Operationsp.  60). 
Own-Retail Activities Expected to Drive Personnel Increases
In 2007,  we expect the number of personnel at the adidas
Group to grow modestly.  Own retail is again anticipated to be
the major driver of this increase.  Personnel expenses for the
adidas Group are projected to grow in line with the number of
newly hired employees. 
R&D Spending Focused on Technological Innovations
In 2007,  the Group will continue to spend around 1% of sales on
research and development.  Areas of particular focus include
running,  football and basketball at the adidas and Reebok
brands,  as well as golf hardware at TaylorMade-adidas Golf. 
The number of employees working in research and development throughout the Group will increase in 2007. 

112  Annual Report 2006  ›  adidas Group  ›

Working Capital Management to Improve Balance Sheet
Operating working capital management is a major focus of
our efforts to improve the Group's balance sheet (see ­Internal
Group Management System,  p.  48).  Our goal is to reduce operating working capital as a percentage of net sales to 25% or
lower in 2007.  Inventory management in particular will be an
important mechanism for the realization of further improvements.  Optimizing inventory levels for fast replenishment
and rigorous control of inventory ageing are the priorities for
our Working Capital Task Force in 2007.  We will also look to
extract further improvement in accounts receivable,  improving collection efforts and optimizing payment terms with our
suppliers to best manage our accounts payable. 
Investment Level Between € 300 Million and € 400 Million
In 2007,  investments in tangible and intangible assets of
between € 300 million and € 400 million within the adidas
Group will be used primarily for own-retail expansion at
brand adidas as well as the increased deployment of SAP and
other IT systems in major subsidiaries within the Group.  In
emerging markets,  own-retail expansion of the Reebok brand
will also begin to play a more significant role.  Expenditure per
brand will be roughly in line with our sales split,  while some
capital expenditure will be related to the further expansion
at adidas Group headquarters in Herzogenaurach,  Germany. 
The most important factors in determining the exact level
and timing of the investment will be the rate at which we are
able to successfully secure retail locations and integrate new
SAP systems within existing applications.  All our investments
will be financed through cash generated in our operating
business. 

Group Management Report  ›

Free Cash Flow to Drive Reductions in Net Borrowings
We intend to further reduce our net borrowings in 2007 to
below € 2 billion through continued strong free cash flow generation and tight working capital management.  At the beginning of 2006,  our net borrowings position increased significantly as a result of our acquisition of Reebok International
Ltd.  (USA).  In 2007,  we will generate at least € 200 million to
€ 300 million in free cash flow,  and we see the potential to
increase this level in subsequent years.  Further,  we are well
on track to achieving our medium-term target of financial
leverage below 50%.  Due to the strong cash generation from
our operating activities,  which enables us to fully meet our
financing requirements,  we do not plan any significant financing initiatives in 2007. 
Dividend Payout Increases 29%
Although debt reduction continues to be a priority,  we are
committed to maintaining the Group's recommended longterm,  earnings-linked dividend payout ratio corridor of
between 15 and 25% of net income.  At our Annual General
Meeting on May 10,  2007,  we intend to propose a dividend
of € 042 per share for the 2006 financial year.  As a resultthe dividend payout will increase 29% to € 85 million (2005:
€ 66 million),  outpacing earnings growth for the year.  This
represents a payout ratio of 18% (2005: 17%) and shows our
confidence in the Group's future business performance. 

›  Subsequent Events and Outlook 
Medium-Term Revenue Synergies from Reebok Integration
We have an ambitious target to generate at least € 500 million
of incremental revenue by 2009 related to the Reebok integration through specific initiatives that include:
»  Branded apparel: We expect to deliver € 100 million from
leveraging adidas' industry-leading branded apparel knowhow to strengthen and expand Reebok's branded apparel
efforts. 
»  Licensed products: At brand adidas,  we expect to generate € 100 million of additional sales in licensed products. 
By transferring the NBA contract to adidas we can further
exploit this exclusive relationship more effectively,  particularly outside of North America.  Also,  further opportunities
exist for other adidas licensed product particularly in North
America from utilizing Reebok's on-field sales and production
capabilities. 
» Regional initiatives: We expect € 100 million of incremental revenue synergies from greater regional traction in Europe
and Asia.  This will result from tighter coordination of Reebok
product category initiatives in underdeveloped markets with
the strong adidas infrastructure. 
»  Distributor buyouts: We project € 200 million in incremental sales synergies through exercising more control over the
Reebok brand around the globe,  particularly in high growth
markets in Asia and Emerging Europe.  This will be achieved
by buying out distributor and joint venture partners. 
Our goal is to deliver these synergies in the following timeline:
€ 100 million in 2007,  € 250 million in 2008 and € 500 million
in 2009.  The costs associated with achieving these synergies
are minimal.  With the exception of distributor buyouts,  which
will be classified as investments versus operating expenseswe currently estimate one-time expenses associated with
all revenue synergies to average between € 15 million and
€ 25 million annually between 2007 and 2009. 

113

Medium-Term Cost Synergies from Reebok Integration
During our integration planning phase,  we have identified an
annual cost of sales and operating expense synergy potential
in an amount of € 175 million.  We expect to realize the full
savings effect by 2009.  In particular,  we project cost savings
to come from the following areas:
»  Cost of sales: By integrating Reebok into our Global Operations function,  we see the potential to achieve a cost of sales
reduction of € 75 million through scale advantages on purchasing by 2009. 
»  Sales and marketing,  distribution,  administration and IT:
We have also identified the opportunity to generate € 100 million in operating expense savings by realizing various initiatives such as joint media buying,  co-locating sales and
global operations teams throughout most of Europe and Asiaharmonizing and consolidating our SAP systems,  eliminating duplicative corporate functions and sharing finance and
administrative services across the Group. 
We expect to generate 50% of the targeted synergies in 2007
and the full 100% as of 2008.  To generate these annual savings we estimate remaining one-time costs of € 140 million50% of which are to occur in 2007 and 50% in 2008.

Strong Medium-Term Outlook
As a result of continued underlying growth of our brands and
the synergies from the Reebok integration,  we expect a strong
top- and bottom-line development over the medium term.  We
project sales for the Group to increase at high-­single-digit
rates on a currency-neutral basis in 2008 and 2009,  respectively.  This development will be driven by continued strength at
adidas and TaylorMade-adidas Golf as well as a revitalization
of the Reebok business segment.  The Group's gross margin
is expected to grow annually to a corridor of between 46 and
48% in 2009,  driven by increases at all brands.  In particularthis development will reflect positive effects from an improving product and geographical mix,  own-retail expansion and
cost of sales synergies derived as a result of the integration
of Reebok.  In the medium term,  we also expect the Group's
operating margin to increase to approximately 11% in 2009driven by improvements at all brands.  Efficiency gains related
to the integration of the Reebok business segment will play
 major role in this development.  Net income is expected to
increase by double-digit rates in 2008 and 2009,  respectivelyas a result of our continuing top-line growth and improved
profitability projected at all brands.

Board approval,  to increase the nominal capital
  until June 19,  2010,  by issuing new shares against con› 
tributions in cash once or several times by no more than a
maximum of € 64062500 and,  subject to Supervisory Board

together with the pro rata amount in the nominal capital of
other shares which were issued by the Company after May
11,  2006,  subject to the exclusion of subscription rights pursuant to § 186 section 3 sentence 4 AktG on the basis of an
authorized capital or following a repurchase,  or for which
conversion or subscription rights were granted after May
11,  2006,  through issuance of convertible bonds or bonds

General Meeting held on May 11,  2006,  the Executive Board

Meeting conditionally increased the nominal capital of adidas
AG by up to € 20000000 through the issuance of no more than
20000000 no-par-value shares for the purpose of meeting
obligations arising from the subscription or conversion rights
based on the bonds with warrants or convertible bonds.

»  Based on a resolution of the Annual General Meeting
dated May 8,  2003,  the Executive Board issued a convertible
bond which entitles bond holders to convert their bonds into
no more than 3921569 shares of adidas AG.  If bond holders exercise their conversion rights,  the Executive Board is
obligated to issue a corresponding number of shares from
the conditional capital,  which was resolved upon at the same
Annual General Meeting.  As at the balance sheet date,  following the implementation of the capital increase from retained
earnings without the issuance of new shares and the implementation of a share split in a ratio of 1 to 4 in June 2006
as well as the exercise of a conversion right resulting from
one bond,  the Executive Board had 15684315 no-par-value
shares remaining for issuance to bond holders in the event of
conversion.  Further,  the Executive Board is entitled,  until May
7,  2008,  based on the aforementioned authorization,  to issue
additional bonds with warrants or convertible bonds bearing
subscription or conversion rights to no more than 18125000
shares.

May 20,  1999,  the Executive Board implemented a Management Share Option Plan (MSOP) for members of the Executive Board of adidas AG,  as well as managing directors/senior
vice presidents of its related companies and other executives
of adidas AG and its related companies (MSOP beneficiaries). 
The last stock options were issued in 2003.  Stock options
arising from the MSOP may only be exercised subject to the
attainment of at least one of two performance objectives (see
Note 33,  p.  178).  If MSOP beneficiaries exercise their stock
options,  the Executive Board is obligated to issue a corresponding number of shares from the conditional capital concurrently resolved upon by the Annual General Meeting.  Following implementation of the capital increase from retained
earnings,  without the issuance of new shares,  and implementation of a share split at a ratio of 1 to 4 in June 2006,  the beneficiaries are now entitled to receive four shares per option
(see Our Share,  p.  34).  At the balance sheet date,  taking into
consideration the shares already issued,  the expired stock
options and the share split,  the Executive Board had 234500
no-par-value shares (58625 stock options) remaining for
issuance to the MSOP beneficiaries. 

Powers of the Executive Board to Repurchase Shares
By resolution of the Annual General Meeting held on May 112006,  the Executive Board is authorized to acquire treasury
shares subject to legal restrictions in an aggregate amount of
up to 10% of the nominal capital until November 10,  2007 for

of shares via the stock exchange or via a tender offer to all
shareholders for cash at a price not significantly below the
stock market price of shares with the same features.

companies.

such as patents,  brands,  names and logos of athletes,  sports
clubs and other third parties or for the acquisition of licenses
relating to such rights.

from bonds with warrants and/or convertible bonds issued by
adidas AG or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries. 
»  To meet the obligations of adidas AG arising from the
MSOP. 

Executive Board and Supervisory Board Compensation
The basic structure of the compensation system and the
total compensation of the Executive and Supervisory Boardsincluding individualized presentation,  is described in the
Compensation Report (see Compensation Report,  p.  30). 
The compensation report is deemed to constitute part of the
Group Management Report. 
Changes to the Articles of Association
The Annual General Meeting is responsible for all changes to
the Articles of Association (§ 179 section 1 sentence 1 AktG). 
Solely amendments to the formulation of the Articles of Association,  i, e.  the wording of the Articles of Association,  has been
assigned by the Annual General Meeting to the Supervisory
Board pursuant to § 10 section 1 sentence 2 of the Articles of
Association.  An Annual General Meeting resolution requires
 simple majority of the votes cast (§ 133 section 1 AktG)unless a larger majority is stipulated by law.  An exception by
virtue of law to the principle of the simple majority of votes
cast applies,  for example,  to amendments to the purpose of
the corporation,  for which pursuant to § 179 section 2 AktG a
three-quarters majority of the nominal capital represented at
the time of resolution is required. 
Material Agreements Relating to the Event of a
Takeover Offer

»  Impossible Is Nothing 
»
The adidas brand's largest campaign in 2007 is 'Impossible Is Nothing"
and this year communication focuses on the mind of the athlete with more
than 20 international sports personalities using their own hand-drawn

­llustrations and paintings to tell their 'impossible" stories.  Each athlete
chose a defining moment in his or her life and set about the task of
creating the images and words which would later be combined to create
the campaign. 
The athletes' experiences come to life through animated films and print
executions.  The results are deeply personal and refreshingly honest. 
Using the stories that unfold in the campaign,  adidas reminds athletes
and non-athletes from every walk of life that they can make their own
'impossibles" come true. 
The campaign focuses on why sports matter,  why athletes matter and
it celebrates what is great and important about sport.

When no-one else believes in you believe in yourself
Hi,  I'm Gilbert Arenas and this is my story:
When I entered the NBA,  the first 40 games of my career I sat
on the bench.  They said I was gonna play zero minutes.  You
know,  I just think they didn't see the talent that I had.  They
thought I was a zero.  Instead of sitting there being bitter,  I just
practiced,  practiced.  If no one believes in you,  anything you do
is a positive.  It wasn't even about basketball any more,  it was
about proving them wrong.  Now the reason I wear No.  0 is
because it lets me know that I need to go out there and fight
every day.

'Impossible Is Nothing" will also be used in 2007 to let consumers tell us about
their own 'impossibles" with stories that can touch the heart or make us laugh. 
These personal anecdotes will then be featured alongside some of adidas' key
innovations including the adiStar and the MegaBounce to produce creative print
ads and point-of-sale material.  The campaign reminds consumers that adidas
knows their goals and can help them achieve their own personal 'impossibles".

'Impossible Is Nothing" is also a core element of adidas football brand communication
in 2007.  Here the story focuses on a battle between two fictitious clubs: 'Predator F. C. "
and 'F50 Club de Fútbol",  which each feature a star line-up of players dedicated to one
of the brand's two best footwear products: 'Predator®" and '+F50 TUNIT".  Predator F. C. 
believes 'Every hero needs a team" and focuses on players such as David BeckhamMichael Ballack,  Kaká and Juan Román Riquelme who have proven themselves as
individuals first but gained iconic stature by elevating the level of the team play they
inspire.  F50 Club de Fútbol features up-and-coming young stars such as Lionel MessiArjen Robben,  Lukas Podolski and Fred who believe 'Every team needs a hero".  They
are famous for breaking away from the pack to get noticed and defying the conventions
of the game.  This campaign invites consumers to sign up for one of the clubs and then
to participate in a football tournament alongside their heroes.

adidas will also utilize the inspiration of 'Impossible Is Nothing" to fuel further
campaigns in 2007 to provide a broad message to different consumer groups. 
One of the best examples of this fresh creative approach is the 'It Takes 5ive"
global basketball campaign.  It is based on the brand's core belief that the sport is
bigger than the individual,  and that athletes working together can do great things. 
This campaign features a team of five top NBA players: Chauncey Billups,  Tim
Duncan,  Gilbert Arenas,  Kevin Garnett and Tracy McGrady all doing what they do
best to blend together for a perfect slam dunk.  Each wears his own signature
shoe which is then launched throughout the basketball season.

'Free Thinking'.  Each element of the campaign combines items from a real and an

In 2007,  Reebok kicks off the global 'Run Easy" campaign. 
This is the brand's most important advertising campaign of
the year.  The message is simple: Reebok wants to inspire
consumers to fulfill their potential and celebrate their
individuality.  The campaign shows consumers that there is a
different way to look at the sport of running.  Running is not
only about blood,  sweat and tears.  Instead,  Reebok wants to
celebrate the camaraderie,  joy and fun of running 'Run
Easy".  The campaign will feature some of Reebok's best
athletes in Premier running footwear and performance
apparel,  demonstrating how they 'Run Easy".

Executive Board Statement
The Executive Board of adidas AG is responsible for the compilation,  completeness and accuracy of the Group's annual consolidated financial statements,  the Group Management Report
and the other information presented in the annual report.  The consolidated financial statements 2006 were prepared in accordance with IFRS,  as adopted by the European Union,  and
the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315a section 1 German
Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch HGB).  The Group Management Report additionally
complies with the requirements of the German Accounting Standard DRS 15. 
To ensure accuracy and reliability of the underlying information,  the content of the ­consolidated
financial statements is based on the information reported in accordance with Group-wide
guidelines which are consistent for all companies included in consolidation.  The integrity of
the reporting process and risk management systems is safeguarded by internal control systems established under the direction of the Executive Board.  These control systems form an
essential part of our value-oriented management style.  As a consequence,  a true and fair view
of the Group's financial position,  results of operations and cash flows and its reporting thereon
is assured and the Executive Board is in a position to recognize potential investment risks and
negative developments at an early stage and take appropriate countermeasures. 
In accordance with the resolution adopted by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting
in 2006,  KPMG Deutsche Treuhand-Gesellschaft Aktiengesellschaft Wirtschaftsprüfungs­
gesellschaft,  Frankfurt am Main,  was appointed by the Supervisory Board as independent

­ uditor to audit the financial statements and consolidated financial statements and the

­ anagement reports.  The Supervisory Board examined and discussed the financial statements and consolidated financial statements,  including the management reports,  as well
as the audit reports at its meeting on the annual financial statements.  The results of these

­ eviews are described in the Supervisory Board Report.

Independent Auditor's Report
We have audited the consolidated financial statements prepared by adidas AG (until May 292006: adidas-Salomon AG),  Herzogenaurach comprising the balance sheet,  the income
statement,  statement of recognized income and expense,  cash flow statement and the notes
to the consolidated financial statements together with the Group Management Report for the
business year from January 1,  2006 to December 31,  2006.  The preparation of the consolidated
financial statements and the Group Management Report in accordance with IFRS,  as adopted
by the EU,  and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315a
section 1 HGB (Handelsgesetzbuch 'German Commercial Code") are the responsibility of the
parent company's Management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated
financial statements and on the Group Management Report based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with § 317 HGB
and German generally accepted standards for the audit of financial statements promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW).  Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit such that misstatements materially affecting the presentation of the net

­ ssets,  financial position and results of operations in the consolidated financial statements
in ­ accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework and in the Group Management Report are detected with reasonable assurance.  Knowledge of the business activities
and the economic and legal environment of the Group and expectations as to possible misstatements are taken into account in the determination of audit procedures.  The effectiveness
of the ­accounting-­related internal control system and the evidence supporting the disclosures
in the consolidated ­ financial statements and the Group Management Report are examined
primarily on a test basis within the framework of the audit.  The audit includes assessing the
annual ­financial statements of those entities included in consolidation,  the determination of
entities to be included in consolidation,  the accounting and consolidation principles used and
significant estimates made by Management,  as well as evaluating the overall presentation of
the consolidated financial statements and Group Management Report.  We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Our audit has not led to any reservations. 
In our opinion,  based on the findings of our audit,  the consolidated financial statements comply
with IFRS,  as adopted by the EU,  and the additional requirements of German commercial law
pursuant to § 315a section 1 HGB and give a true and fair view of the net assets,  financial position and results of operations of the Group in accordance with these requirements.  The Group
Management Report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and as a whole
provides a suitable view of the Group's position and suitably presents the opportunities and
risks of future development.

 » Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the consolidationaccounting and valuation principles described below. 

Currency Translation
Transactions of assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into the functional
currency euro at spot rates on the transaction date. 
Assets and liabilities of the Group's non-euro functional currency subsidiaries are translated into euro at closing exchange rates at the balance sheet date.  Revenues and expenses
are translated at the exchange rates on the transaction dates.  All cumulative differences from
the translation of equity of foreign subsidiaries resulting from changes in exchange rates are
included in a separate item within shareholders' equity without affecting income. 
In the individual financial statements of Group companies,  monetary items denominated
in non-euro currencies are generally measured at closing exchange rates at the balance sheet
date.  The resulting currency gains and losses are recorded directly in income. 
 summary of exchange rates to euro for major currencies in which the Group operates
is as follows:

Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of adidas AG and its direct and
indirect subsidiaries,  which are prepared in accordance with uniform accounting principles. 
 company is considered as a subsidiary if adidas AG directly or indirectly governs the
financial and operating policies of the respective enterprise. 
The number of consolidated companies evolved as follows for the years ending December 31,  2006 and 2005,  respectively.

 schedule of the shareholdings of adidas AG is shown in Attachment II to these Notes. 

­ urthermore,  a schedule of these shareholdings will be filed with the Commercial Register at
the Local Court in Fürth (Bavaria). 
The first-time consolidation of the purchased companies had a material impact in 2006
(see Note 5). 
Within the scope of the first-time consolidation,  all acquired assets and liabilities are
recognized in the balance sheet at fair value.  A debit difference between the book value and
the proportionate fair value of the assets and liabilities is shown as goodwill.  A credit difference is recorded in the income statement.  No fair value adjustments are recognized at the first
consolidation of acquired minority interest of companies accounted with the purchase method. 
 debit difference between the cost of the additional investment and the carrying amount of
the net assets at the acquisition date is shown as goodwill.  A credit difference is recorded in
the income statement. 
All intercompany transactions and balances,  as well as any unrealized gains and losses
arising from intercompany transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial
statements.

Derivative Financial Instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments,  such as interest and currency options,  forward contracts,  as well as interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge
its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks.  In accordance with its treasury policythe Group does not hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. 
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognized in the balance sheet at fair valueand subsequently measured also at their fair value.  The method of recognizing the resulting
gain or loss is dependent on the nature of the item being hedged.  On the date a derivative contract is entered into,  the Group designates certain derivatives as either a hedge of a forecasted
transaction (cash flow hedge),  a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability (fair
value hedge) or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign entity. 

Notes  ›

151

Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedgesand that are 100% effective,  as defined in IAS 39,  are recognized in equity.  Insofar as the effectiveness is not 100%,  the ineffective part of the fair value is recognized in net income.  Cumulated gains and losses in equity are transferred to the income statement in the same periods
during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects the income statement. 
For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges,  the gain or loss on the derivatives and the offsetting gains or losses on the hedged items are recognized immediately
in net income. 
Certain derivative transactions,  while providing effective economic hedges under the
Group's risk management policies,  do not qualify for hedge accounting under the specific rules
of IAS 39.  Changes in the fair values of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge
accounting under IAS 39 are recognized immediately in the income statement. 
Hedges of net investments in foreign entities are accounted in a similar way to cash flow
hedges.  If the hedging instrument is a derivative (e.g.  a forward contract) or,  for example,  a
foreign currency borrowing,  effective currency gains and losses in the derivative and all gains
and losses arising on the translation of the borrowing,  respectively,  are recognized in equity. 
The Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items
at transaction inception,  as well as the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.  This process includes linking all derivatives designated as
hedges to specific forecasted transactions.  The Group also documents its assessment whether
the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective by using different
methods of effectiveness testing,  such as the dollar offset method or the hypothetical derivative method. 
The fair values of forward contracts and currency options are determined on the basis of
the market conditions on the reporting dates.  The fair value of a currency option is determined
using generally accepted models to calculate option prices.  The fair market value of an option is influenced not only by the remaining term of the option but also by further determining
factors,  such as the actual foreign exchange rate and the volatility of the underlying foreign
currency base.  The fair values of interest rate options on the reporting date are assessed by
generally accepted models,  such as the 'Markov functional model". 

Inventories
Merchandise and finished goods are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value.  Costs
are determined using a standard valuation method: the first-in,  first-out method or the
average cost method.  Costs of finished goods include cost of raw materials,  direct labor and
manufacturing overheads.  The lower of cost or net realizable value allowances are computed
consistently throughout the Group based on the age and expected future sales of the items on
hand. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents represent cash and short-term bank deposits with maturities of
three months or less from the date of acquisition. 
Receivables and Other Assets
Receivables are recognized at fair value,  which is estimated as the present value of future cash
flows discounted at the market rate of interest at the balance sheet date.  If necessary,  required
allowances are determined on the basis of individual risk assessment and past experience of
losses. 

Assets/Liabilities Classified as Held-for-Sale
Assets and liabilities (primarily non-current) that are expected to be recovered principally
through sale rather than through continuing use are classified as held-for-sale.  These are
measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell. 
Property,  Plant and Equipment
Property,  plant and equipment are stated at cost (which comprises any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in
the manner intended by Management) less accumulated depreciation (except for land) and

­ ccumulated impairment losses.  Depreciation is computed by the straight-line method,  except
where the declining-balance method is more appropriate in light of the actual utilization pattern.  Useful lives are as follows:
Useful Lives of Property,  Plant and Equipment
	Years
Buildings	
Leasehold improvements	
Technical equipment and machinery as well as other equipment and furniture and fittings	

10 – 50
5 – 20
2 – 10

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.  Renewals and improvements are capitalized and depreciated separately,  if the recognition criteria are met. 
Impairment
In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the costs of non-current assets (financial and non-financial assets) are impaired,  an evaluation of recoverability is performed.  An
impairment loss is recognized in the income statement if the carrying amount exceeds the
recoverable amount.  If there is an impairment loss for a cash-generating unit,  first the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cash-generating unit is reduced,  and subsequently
the other assets of the unit are reduced pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each
asset in the unit. 

152  Annual Report 2006  ›  adidas Group  ›

Consolidated Financial Statements  ›

Irrespective of whether there is an indication of impairment,  intangible assets with an

­ndefinite useful life and goodwill acquired in business combinations are tested annually for
im­pairment. 
An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed.  In respect of other assetsan impairment loss recognized in prior periods is reversed if there has been a change in the
estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.  An impairment loss is reversed only to
the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would
have been determined (net of depreciation or amortization) if no impairment loss had been
recognized. 

In 2006,  the adidas Group determined that there was no impairment necessary for any of its
trademarks with indefinite useful lives. 
The recoverable amount is determined on the basis of fair value less costs to sell,  which
are calculated with 1% of the fair value.  The fair value is determined in discounting the royalty
savings after tax and adding a tax amortization benefit,  resulting from the amortization of
the acquired asset (relief-from-royalty method).  These calculations use projections of royalty
savings based on the financial planning covering a maximum period of five years in total.  Royalty savings beyond this period are extrapolated using steady growth rates of around 2%.  The
growth rates do not exceed the long-term average growth rate of the business in which the
trademarks are allocated. 
The discount rate is based on a weighted average cost of capital calculation considering the debt/equity structure and financing costs of the major competitors.  The discount rate
used is after-tax rates and reflects specific equity and country risk.  The applied discount rate
is 75%. 
Expenditures for internally generated intangible assets are expensed as incurred if they
do not qualify for recognition. 

Finance Leases
If under a lease agreement substantially all risks and rewards associated with an asset are
transferred to the Group,  the asset less accumulated depreciation and the corresponding

­ iability are recognized at the fair value of the asset or the lower net present value of the minimum lease payments.  Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge
and the reduction of the outstanding liability.  The finance expense is allocated to each period
during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining
balance of the liability. 
Identifiable Intangible Assets
Acquired intangible assets are valued at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment
losses.  Amortization is calculated on a straight-line basis with the following useful lives:

Goodwill
Goodwill is the excess of the purchase cost over the fair value of acquired identifiable assets
and liabilities.  Goodwill arising from the acquisition of a foreign entity and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities of that foreign entity are treated
as assets of the reporting entity and are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the date of
the initial consolidation.  Goodwill is carried in the functional currency of the acquired foreign
entity. 
Acquired goodwill is valued at cost less accumulated impairment losses.  From January 12005,  scheduled amortization of goodwill ceased.  Goodwill is tested annually for impairmentand additionally when there are indications of potential impairment. 
Goodwill has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to three cash-generating
units.  The Group's cash-generating units are identified according to brand of operations (in the
prior year according to brands and regions) in line with the internal management approach. 
The adidas Group has thus defined the three segments adidas,  Reebok and TaylorMade-adidas
Golf as the relevant cash-generating units. 

Notes  ›

153

The carrying amounts of already existing as well as newly acquired goodwill are allocated to
the cash-generating units as follows:

Financial Assets
All purchases and sales of investments are recognized on the trade date.  Costs of purchases
include transaction costs.  If the fair value of available-for-sale investments can be measured
reliably,  they are subsequently carried at fair value.  Realized and unrealized gains and losses
arising from changes in the fair value of these investments are included in the income statement of the period in which they arise except for available-for-sale financial assets where
unrealized gains and losses are recognized in equity unless they are impaired.

The recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is determined on the basis of fair value
less costs to sell,  which are calculated with 1% of the fair value.  These calculations use cash
flow projections based on the financial planning covering a five-year period in total.  Cash flows
beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using steady growth rates of around 2%.  The
growth rates do not exceed the long-term average growth rate of the business in which each
cash-generating unit operates. 
The discount rates are based on a weighted average cost of capital calculation considering the debt/equity structure and financing costs of the major competitors of each cashg
­ enerating unit.  The discount rates used are after-tax rates and reflect specific equity and
country risk of the relevant cash-generating unit.  The applied discount rates for the specific
cash-generating unit are between 72% and 80%. 
Research and Development
Research costs are expensed as incurred.  Development costs are also expensed as incurred if
the recognition criteria are not met. 
The Group spent € 98 million and € 63 million on product research and development for
the years ending December 31,  2006 and 2005,  respectively. 

Borrowings and Other Liabilities
Borrowings and other liabilities are recognized at fair value using the effective interest ­methodnet of transaction costs incurred.  In subsequent periods,  long-term borrowings are stated at
amortized cost using the effective interest method.  Any difference between proceeds (net of
transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognized in the income statement over the
terms of the borrowings. 
The fair value of the liability component of the convertible bond is determined using a
market interest rate for a comparable straight bond; this amount is presented under longterm borrowings on an amortized cost basis until conversion or maturity of the bond.  The
remaining portion is included in shareholders' equity where the value of the equity component
is not changed in subsequent periods. 
Provisions
Provisions are recognized where a present legal or constructive obligation has been

­ncurred which is likely to lead to an outflow of resources whereas the timing or amount is
uncertain.  Non-current provisions are discounted if the effect of discounting is material. 
Pensions and Similar Obligations
Provisions for pensions and similar obligations comprise the provision obligation of the Group
under defined benefit and contribution plans.  The obligations under defined benefit plans are
calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of benefit that employees have
earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.  That benefit is discounted
to determine its present value,  and all unrecognized past service costs and the fair value of
any plan assets are deducted.  The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on highq
­ uality corporate bonds.  The calculations are performed by qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit method in accordance with IAS 19.  Obligations for contributions to defined
contribution plans are recognized as an expense in the income statement when they are due. 

154  Annual Report 2006  ›  adidas Group  ›

Consolidated Financial Statements  ›

As of January 1,  2005,  due to application of the amendment to IAS 19 'Employee Benefits"
issued in December 2004,  the Group recognizes actuarial gains or losses of defined benefit
plans arising during the financial year immediately outside the income statement in 'other
reserves" within equity as shown in the statement of recognized income and expense. 

Equity Compensation Benefits
Stock options have been granted to members of the Executive Board of adidas AG as well
as to the managing directors/senior vice presidents of its affiliated companies and to further

­ enior executives of the Group in connection with the Management Share Option Plan (MSOP)
of adidas AG (see also Note 33).  The Company has the choice to settle a possible obligation by

­ssuing new shares or providing the equivalent cash compensation.  When options are exercised
and the Company decides to issue new shares,  the proceeds received net of any transaction
costs are credited to share capital and capital surplus.  In the past,  the Company has chosen to
issue new shares.  It is planned to maintain this methodology in future. 
In accordance with IFRS 2,  an expense and a corresponding entry to equity for equitysettled stock options and an expense and a liability for cash-settled stock options is recorded. 
The Group has applied IFRS 2 retrospectively and has taken advantage of the transitional
provisions of IFRS 2 with respect to equity-settled awards.  As a result,  the Group has applied
IFRS 2 only to equity-settled awards granted after November 7,  2002,  that had not yet vested
on January 1,  2005 [Tranche V (2003)]. 

Recognition of Revenues
Sales are recognized at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods are transferred to the buyer and when it is
probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group. 
Royalty and commission income is recognized based on the terms of the contracts on an
accrual basis. 
Advertising and Promotional Expenditures
Production costs for media campaigns are included in prepaid expenses (other current and
non-current assets) until the advertising is finalized,  after which they are expensed in full. 
Significant media buying costs (e.g.  broadcasting fees) are expensed over the original duration
of the campaign after usage. 
Promotional expenses,  including one-time up-front payments for promotional contractsare expensed systematically over the term of the agreement. 
Interest
Interest is recognized as income or expense as incurred and is not capitalized. 
Income Taxes
Current income taxes are computed in accordance with the applicable taxation rules established in the countries in which the Group operates. 
The Group computes deferred taxes for all temporary differences between the carrying
amount and the tax basis of its assets and liabilities and tax loss carryforwards.  As it is not
permitted to recognize a deferred tax liability for goodwill the Group does not compute any
deferred taxes thereon. 
Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences and tax loss carryforwards which exceed taxable temporary differences are only recognized to the extent that it
is probable that the company concerned will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the
associated benefit. 
Income tax is recognized in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to
items recognized directly in equity,  in which case it is recognized in equity. 

Estimation Uncertainty
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of assumptions and estimates that affect reported amounts and related disclosures.  Although such

­ stimates are based on Management's best knowledge of current events and actions,  actual
results may ultimately differ from these estimates. 
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment
to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are outlined in
the respective Note.

 » Acquisition/Disposal of Subsidiaries
The adidas Group assumed full ownership of its subsidiary in India,  adidas India Marketing
Private Ltd.,  New Delhi (India),  by purchasing the remaining 86% of shares effective January
17,  2006 for an amount of € 2 million. 
Effective January 31,  2006,  the adidas Group assumed control of Reebok International
Ltd.  (USA),  with all its direct and indirect shareholdings.  The purchase price for 100% of the
shares of Reebok International Ltd.  (USA) was US $ 36 billion (€ 30 billion),  fully paid in cash. 
The acquisition had the following effect on the Group's assets and liabilities:

Following valuation methods for the acquired assets have been applied:

Pre-acquisition carrying amounts were based on applicable IFRS standards. 

» Inventories: The pro rata basis valuation is applied for estimating the fair value of acquired
inventories.  The realized margins were added to the book values of the acquired inventories. 
Subsequently,  cost to complete for selling,  advertising and general administration and a reasonable profit allowance were deducted. 
» Property,  plant and equipment: The comparison method was used for acquired land by
considering the prices paid for comparable properties.  The direct capitalization method was
applied for the valuation of all acquired buildings.  The annual rents which can be realized will
be adjusted by deducting risk factors and applicable operating costs and are finally ­discounted. 
The acquired machinery and equipment is valued with the depreciated replacement cost

­ ethod.  The replacement costs are determined by applying an index to the asset's historical
cost.  The replacement costs are then adjusted for the loss in value caused by depreciation. 
»  Trademarks and other intangible assets: The relief-from-royalty method is applied for
trademarks and technologies.  The fair value is determined by discounting the royalty savings
after tax and adding a tax amortization benefit,  resulting from the amortization of the acquired
asset.  For the valuation of licensing agreements,  customer relationships and order backlogsthe multi-period-excess-earnings method was used.  The respective future excess cash flows
are identified and adjusted in order to eliminate all elements not associated with these assets. 
Future cash flows are measured on the basis of the expected sales by deducting variable and
sales-related imputed costs for the use of contributory assets.  Subsequently,  the outcome is
discounted using an appropriate discount rate and adding a tax amortization benefit. 
» Long-term financial assets: The discounted cash flow method was used for the valuation
of a participation.  Future free cash flows were discounted back to the valuation date using an
appropriate discount rate. 

Notes  ›

The excess of the acquisition cost paid over the net of the amounts of the fair values assigned
to all assets acquired and liabilities assumed,  taking into consideration the respective deferred
taxes,  is referred to as goodwill.  Any acquired asset that does not meet the identification and
recognition criteria for an asset is included in the amount recognized as goodwill. 
Based on the expected cost of sales and operating expenses synergy potential,  the goodwill arising on this acquisition was allocated to the cash-generating units adidas and Reebok
in an amount of € 699 million and € 466 million,  respectively,  and is converted in functional
currencies as appropriate. 
If this acquisition had occurred on January 1,  2006,  total Group net sales would have been
€ 102 billion and net income would have been € 448 million for the year ending December 312006. 
The acquired Reebok subsidiaries contributed € 92 million to the Group's operating profit
for the period from February to December 2006.  The contribution to the net income cannot be
disclosed due to the advanced integration of the financing and tax activities. 
Effective September 1,  2006,  the adidas Group assumed full ownership of its brand
adidas subsidiary in Korea,  adidas Korea Ltd.,  Seoul (Korea),  by purchasing the remaining 49%
of shares for an amount of € 30 million.  The additional net income for the Group for the period
from September to December 2006 was € 1 million. 
Effective September 1,  2006,  the adidas Group sold its 92% of shares in P. T.  Trigaris
Sportindo (adidas Indonesia) in connection with a restructuring of the Indonesian business.

The increase in goodwill relates to the acquisition of the Reebok business.  The main part
of this goodwill is denominated in US dollars.  The currency translation effect was negative
€ 88 million. 
From January 1,  2005,  goodwill is tested annually for impairment.  There was no

­mpairment expense for the years ending December 31,  2006 and 2005.  The Group determines
whether goodwill impairment is necessary at least on an annual basis.  This requires an estimation of the fair value less costs to sell of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill is
allocated.  Estimating the fair value less costs to sell requires the Group to make an estimate
of the expected future cash flows from the cash-generating unit and also to choose a suitable
discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. 
Future changes in expected cash flows and discount rates may lead to impairments of the

­ ccounted goodwill in the future.

Intangible asset amortization expenses (continuing operations) were € 69 million and € 34 million for the years ending December 31,  2006 and 2005,  respectively (see also Note 25). 
Trademarks with indefinite useful lives amount to € 1436 billion.  They were estimated to
be indefinite due to the high degree of brand recognition as well as their foundation a long time
ago.  The trademarks are allocated to the cash-generating unit Reebok. 
The Group determines whether trademarks with indefinite useful lives are impaired at
least on an annual basis.  This requires an estimation of the fair value less costs to sell of the
cash-generating units to which the trademark is allocated.  Estimating the fair value less costs
to sell requires the Group to make an estimate of the expected future brand-specific sales
and appropriate arm's length royalty rates from the cash-generating unit and also to choose a
suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.  There was no
impairment expense for the year ending December 31,  2006. 
Future changes in expected cash flows and discount rates may lead to impairments of the

­ ccounted trademarks in the future.

14 » Long-Term Financial Assets
Long-term financial assets include a 10% investment in FC Bayern München AG of € 77 million
which was made in July 2002.  This investment is classified as available for sale and recorded
at fair value.  This equity security does not have a quoted market price in an active markettherefore other methods of reasonably estimating fair value as at December 31,  2006 were
used.  Dividends are distributed instead of a regular payment of interest. 
Additionally,  long-term financial assets include investments which are mainly invested in
insurance products and are measured at fair value,  as well as loans. 
Fair value adjustments from impairment losses amount to € 8 million and € 15 million
for the years ending December 31,  2006 and 2005,  respectively.  As in the prior year these are
related to impairments of other financial assets to cover anticipated risks of default (see also
Note 27).

16 » Borrowings and Credit Lines
In response to the increased financing needs due to the acquisition of Reebok International Ltd.  (USA),  the Group adjusted its financing policy.  In 2005,  the German Commercial
­Paper Program was increased by € 125 billion to € 20 billion.  Additionally,  the international

­ edium-term syndicated loan was increased to € 20 billion from € 750 million,  with extended

­ aturities.  Furthermore,  the number of banks participating in the Commercial Paper Program
as well as the syndicated loan was extended.  Additionally,  in January 2006,  the Group issued
 US private placement with a transaction volume of US $ 10 billion.  Bilateral credit lines with
core banks in an amount of approximately € 24 billion as well as the € 400 million convertible
bond ­issued by adidas International Finance B. V.  in 2003 supplement the diversification of the
Group's ­financing structure. 
With settlement on October 8,  2003,  adidas issued a € 400 million convertible bond
through its wholly-owned Dutch subsidiary,  adidas International Finance B. V.  The bond was
guaranteed by adidas AG and issued in tranches of € 50000 each with a maturity up to 15 years. 
The bond is,  at the option of the respective holder,  subject to certain conditions,  convertible
from and including November 18,  2003,  up to and including September 20,  2018,  into ordinary
no-par-value bearer shares of adidas AG at the conversion price of € 2550 which was fixed
upon issue.  The coupon of the bond is 25% and is payable annually in arrears on October
 of each year,  commencing on October 8,  2004.  The bond is convertible into approximately
four million no-par-value shares. 
The convertible bond is not callable by the issuer until October 2009.  It is callable thereafter,  subject to a 130% trigger between October 2009 and October 2012 and subject to a
115% trigger between October 2012 and 2015.  The convertible bond is unconditionally callable
thereafter.  Investors have the right to convert the bond in October 2009,  October 2012 and
October 2015. 
The fair values of the liability component and the equity conversion component were

­ etermined on the issuance of the bond.  The fair value of the liability component,  included in
long-term borrowings,  was calculated using a market interest rate of approximately 46% for
an equivalent straight bond without conversion rights.  Due to the retrospective application of
the amendment to IAS 39 and IAS 32,  the liability and equity split of the convertible bond has
changed.  As a result,  the liability component as at the date of issuance increased by € 711 million with an equivalent decrease in equity.  The amount of the equity component,  which is included in equity in the capital reserve,  amounts to € 441 million (less transaction costs of
€ 09 million).  The liability component is valued on amortized cost basis.

Notes  ›

The adidas AG share first traded above 110% (€ 2805) of the conversion price of € 2550 on
more than 20 trading days within the last 30 trading days in the fourth quarter of 2004.  Consequently,  bond holders have had the right to convert their convertible bonds into equity since
January 1,  2005.  An early redemption or conversion of the convertible bond is currently not
expected. 
Gross borrowings increased by € 1543 billion in 2006 compared to a decline of € 85 million in 2005.

164  Annual Report 2006  ›  adidas Group  ›

Consolidated Financial Statements  ›

The actuarial valuations of the defined benefit plans are made at the end of each reporting
period.  The assumptions for employee turnover and mortality are based on empirical data,  the
latter for Germany on the 2005 version of the mortality tables of Dr.  Heubeck.  The actuarial
assumptions in Germany and in other countries are not materially different. 
As of January 1,  2005,  due to application of the amendment to IAS 19 'Employee Benefits"
issued in December 2004,  the Group recognizes actuarial gains or losses of defined benefit
plans arising during the financial year immediately outside the income statement in the statement of recognized income and earnings (SoRIE).  The actuarial gain (loss) recognized in the
statement of recognized income and expense for 2006 was € 2 million (2005: € 14 million) The
cumulative recognized actuarial losses amount to € 30 million (2005: € 31 million) (see also
Note 22).

Of the total pension expenses,  an amount of € 7 million (2005: € 11 million) relates to employees in Germany.  Contributions to post-employment benefit plans for employees living in
Germany for the year ending December 31,  2007,  are expected to amount to € 11 million.  The
pension expense is recorded within the operating expenses whereas the production-related
part thereof is recognized within the cost of sales.

The calculations of the recognized assets and liabilities from defined benefit plans are based
upon statistical and actuarial calculations.  In particular,  the present value of the defined benefit obligation is impacted by assumptions on discount rates used to arrive at the present
value of future pension liabilities and assumptions on future increases in salaries and benefits. 
Furthermore,  the Group's independent actuaries use statistically based assumptions covering areas such as future participant plan withdrawals and estimates on life expectancy.  The

­ ctuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changes in market
and economic conditions,  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of
participants and other changes in the factors being assessed.  These differences could impact
the assets or liabilities recognized in the balance sheet in future periods.

This line item within equity comprises the equity of third parties in a number of consolidated
companies.  Minority interests are attributable to three and four subsidiaries as at December
31,  2006 and 2005,  respectively (see Shareholdings/Attachment II to these Notes). 
These subsidiaries were mainly established with former independent distributors
and ­ licensees for the adidas brand or purchased as part of the acquisition of the Reebok

­ usiness. 
In accordance with IAS 32,  the following minority interests are no longer reported within
minority interests: GEV Grundstücksgesellschaft Herzogenaurach mbH & Co.  KG (Germany)as the company is a limited partnership,  and adidas Hellas A. E.  (Greece) and adidas Suomi
OY (Finland),  as these minorities hold put options.  The fair value of these minorities is shown
within other liabilities.  The difference between the fair value and the minority interests is
shown as goodwill less accumulated amortization.  The result for these minorities is reported
within financial expenses.

22 » Shareholders' Equity
On December 31,  2005,  the nominal capital of adidas AG (formerly adidas-Salomon AG)
amounted to € 12995009280 and was divided into 50761755 no-par-value bearer shares
and was fully paid-in. 
In January 2006,  the nominal capital increased to a total of € 13009166080,  divided into
50817055 no-par-value bearer shares,  as a result of the exercise of a total of 55300 stock
options in November 2005 and the issuance of 55300 no-par-value bearer shares associated
with the Management Share Option Plan (MSOP) of adidas AG.  Capital reserves thus increased
by € 2830920. 
The nominal capital of adidas AG subsequently increased to a total of € 203268220 as
 result of the capital increase from the Company's retained earnings without the issuance of
new shares ('Capital Increase 2006"),  resolved upon by the Annual General Meeting on May 112006.  Furthermore,  it was resolved to implement a share split at a ratio of 1 to 4,  pursuant to
which the nominal capital was divided into a total of 203268220 no-par-value bearer shares. 
At the end of May 2006,  the nominal capital of adidas AG increased to a total of
€ 203270180,  divided into 203270180 no-par-value bearer shares,  as a result of the exercise
of the conversion right derived from one bond in the amount of € 50000 issued within the
scope of the convertible bonds granted by the 100% subsidiary adidas International Finance
B. V.  (formerly adidas-Salomon International Finance B. V. ) (€ 400000000; 250% convertible
bonds of 2003/2018) and also as a result of the issuance of 1960 no-par-value bearer shares. 
Furthermore,  in July 2006,  the nominal capital increased to a total of € 203496860d
­ ivided into 203496860 no-par-value bearer shares,  as a result of the exercise of a total of
56670 stock options in May 2006,  which following the registration of the share split now
entitle the beneficiaries to receive four shares per option,  and through the issuance of 226680
no-par-value bearer shares associated with the Management Share Option Plan.  Capital

­ eserves thus increased by € 3321108. 
In October 2006,  the nominal capital again increased as a result of the exercise of a total of 10000 stock options in August 2006 and the issuance of 40000 no-par-value bearer
shares associated with the Management Share Option Plan.  Capital reserves thus increased
by € 121890.  At the balance sheet date,  the nominal capital of adidas AG therefore amounted
to a total of € 203536860 and was divided into 203536860 no-par-value bearer shares.  The
nominal capital was fully paid-in. 
In January 2007,  the nominal capital of adidas AG was then increased by a further
€ 30200 as a result of the exercise of 7550 stock options in November 2006 and the issuance
of 30200 no-par-value bearer shares associated with the Management Share Option Plan. 
Capital reserves thus increased by € 175296.  On February 16,  2007,  the nominal capital of
adidas AG therefore amounted to € 203567060 and is divided into 203567060 no-par-value
bearer shares. 
The corresponding adjustment of the amount of the nominal capital resulting from the
above transactions up to the end of January 2007 was filed with the Commercial Register on
January 29,  2007,  by way of a declaratory entry. 
Each share has one vote and is entitled to a dividend in the year it is issued.

Authorized Capital
As at the balance sheet date 2006,  the Executive Board of adidas AG has not made use of the
existing amounts of Authorized Capital.  The following presentation of the existing amounts of

­ ssentially below the stock exchange value of shares with the same features (Authorized

­ apital 2006).  The authorization to exclude subscription rights pursuant to the last sentencemay,  however,  only be used to the extent that the pro rata amount of the new shares in the
nominal capital together with the pro rata amount in the nominal capital of other shares which
were issued by the Company after May 11,  2006,  subject to the exclusion of subscription rights
pursuant to § 186 section 3 sentence 4 AktG on the basis of an authorized capital ­ increase

­ ominal capital existing on the date of entry of this authorization into the Commercial Register
or if this amount is lower as at the respective date on which the authorization is used. 
Contingent Capital
Together with the Capital Increase 2006 resolved upon by the Annual General Meeting on May
11,  2006,  and by virtue of law,  the amounts of Contingent Capital increased at the same ratio. 
By resolution of the Annual General Meeting of May 11,  2006,  the Articles of Association were
adjusted to reflect this increase as well as the share split. 
Contingent Capital 1999/I
The Contingent Capital 1999/I serves the purpose of granting stock options in connection with
the Management Share Option Plan to members of the Executive Board of adidas AG as well
as to managing directors/senior vice presidents of its affiliated companies and to other executives of adidas AG and of its affiliated companies. 
Prior to the implementation of the Capital Increase 2006 and the share split,  as a result
of the exercise of 55300 stock options in November 2005 and the issuance of 55300 no-parvalue bearer shares within the scope of the exercise periods which ended in January 2006
for Tranche I (1999),  Tranche II (2000),  Tranche III (2001),  Tranche IV (2002) and Tranche V
(2003) of the Management Share Option Plan,  the nominal amount of the Contingent Capital
1999/I amounted to € 110229120 in January 2006 and was divided into 430582 no-par-value
shares. 

Notes  ›

After implementation of the Capital Increase 2006 and the share split,  the nominal amount of
the Contingent Capital 1999/I initially totaled € 1722328 and was divided into 1722328 nopar-value bearer shares.  As a result of the exercise of 66670 stock options and the issuance of
266680 no-par-value bearer shares associated with the exercise periods which ended in July
and October for Tranche II (2000),  Tranche III (2001),  Tranche IV (2002) and Tranche V (2003) of
the Management Share Option Plan,  the nominal amount of the Contingent Capital 1999/I at
the balance sheet date amounted to € 1455648 and was divided into 1455648 no-par-value
shares. 
In January 2007,  the nominal value of the Contingent Capital 1999/I was reduced to
€ 1425448,  divided into 1425448 no-par-value shares,  as a result of the exercise of 7550
stock options in November 2006 and the issuance of 30200 no-par-value bearer shares associated with the expired exercise period for Tranche II (2000),  Tranche III (2001),  Tranche IV
(2002) as well as Tranche V (2003) of the Management Share Option Plan.  On February 162007,  the nominal value of the Contingent Capital 1999/I amounted to € 1425448,  divided into
1425448 no-par-value shares. 
The change to the nominal capital and the nominal value of the Contingent Capital 1999/I
resulting from the issuance of shares between the implementation of the Capital Increase
2006 and the end of January 2007,  was filed with the Commercial Register on January 29,  2007by way of a declaratory entry. 
Contingent Capital 2003/II
As at the balance sheet date,  the nominal capital is conditionally increased by up to an additional € 35998040,  divided into no more than 35998040 no-par-value bearer shares (Contingent Capital 2003/II,  § 4 section 6 (former section 5) of the Articles of Association).  This is
the Contingent Capital which formerly amounted to € 23040000 and was then adjusted to
€ 36000000 as a result of the Capital Increase 2006.  It will be implemented only to the extent
that the holders of the subscription or conversion rights or the persons obligated to exercise the subscription or conversion duties based on the bonds with warrants or convertible
bonds,  which are issued by the Company or a wholly-owned direct or indirect subsidiary of the
Company pursuant to the authorization of the Executive Board by the shareholder resolution
dated May 8,  2003,  in the version of the shareholder resolution dated May 11,  2006,  make use
of their subscription or conversion right or,  if they are obligated to exercise the subscription or conversion rights,  they meet their obligations to exercise the warrant or convert the
bond.  The Executive Board is authorized,  subject to Supervisory Board approval,  to fully suspend the shareholders' rights to subscribe the bonds with warrants and/or convertible bondsif the ­Executive Board has concluded following an examination in accordance with its legal

­ uties that the issue price of the bonds with warrants and/or convertible bonds is not significantly ­below the hypothetical market value computed using recognized financial calculation

­ ethods.  This ­ authorization to suspend the subscription rights applies,  however,  only with
respect to the bonds with warrants and/or convertible bonds with subscription or conversion
rights to the shares having a pro rata amount of the registered share capital totaling a maximum of approximately € 18125000. 
During 2006,  the Contingent Capital 2003/II was reduced by € 1960 to the aforementioned value,  as a result of the exercise of the conversion right from one bond amounting to
€ 50000 and the issuance of 1960 no-par-value shares.

warrant or convert the bond.  The Executive Board is authorized,  subject to Supervisory Board
approval,  to fully suspend the shareholders' rights to subscribe the bonds with warrants and/
or convertible bonds,  if the bonds with warrants and/or convertible bonds are issued at a price
which is not significantly below the market value of these bonds.  The limit for subscription
right exclusions of 10% of the registered stock capital according to § 186 section 3 sentence
 together with § 221 section 4 sentence 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act has been

­ bserved.  To date,  no shares have been issued from the Contingent Capital 2006. 
By resolution of the Annual General Meeting of May 11,  2006,  relating to Contingent Capital 2006,  Contingent Capital 2004 was cancelled. 
Acquisition of Treasury Shares
By resolution of the Annual General Meeting held on May 11,  2006,  the shareholders of adidas
AG cancelled the authorization to repurchase treasury shares resolved upon on May 4,  2005which had not been used,  and resolved upon a new authorization of the Executive Board to

­ cquire treasury shares in an aggregate amount of up to 10% of the nominal capital for any
permissible purpose and within the legal framework until November 10,  2007.  The authorization can be used by the Company but also by Group companies or by third parties,  on the
account of the Company or Group companies.  The Executive Board is authorized to use the
treasury shares repurchased on the basis of this authorization for the following purposes:

» Subject to Supervisory Board approval,  for the purpose of acquiring companies,  parts of
companies or participations in companies. 
» Subject to Supervisory Board approval,  as consideration for the acquisition,  also through

»  To meet subscription or conversion rights or conversion obligations arising from bonds
with warrants and/or convertible bonds issued by the Company or any direct or indirect subsidiary of the Company. 

Reserves
Reserves within shareholders' equity are as follows:
»  Capital reserve: comprises the paid premium within the issue of share capital. 

»  To meet the Company's obligations arising from the Management Share Option Plan 1999
(MSOP). 
Furthermore,  the Supervisory Board is authorized to assign or promise reacquired treasury
shares to Executive Board members as compensation by way of a stock bonus,  subject to the
proviso that resale shall only be permitted following a retention period of at least two years
from the date of assignment. 
This authorization has not been used to date. 
Convertible Bond
adidas International Finance B. V.  issued a convertible bond with a nominal value of
€ 400000000 on October 8,  2003 divided into 8000 convertible bonds with a nominal value of
€ 50000 each.  The convertible bond is due for repayment on October 8,  2018,  if not previously
repaid or converted into adidas AG shares.  adidas AG has assumed the unconditional and irrevocable guarantee with respect to payments of all amounts payable under the convertible bond
by adidas International Finance B. V.  for this convertible bond.  adidas AG has also taken over
the obligation to the holders of the convertible bond to supply shares to be delivered following
conversion of a convertible bond.  The convertible bond entitles the holder to acquire shares in
adidas AG at a conversion price of an original € 102 per share,  whereby the conversion ratio
results from dividing the nominal amount of a bond (€ 50000) by the conversion price ruling
at the exercise date.  The conversion price has been meanwhile adjusted to € 2550 following
the stock split.  The conversion right can be exercised by a bond holder between November 182003 and September 20,  2018,  whereby certain conversion restrictions apply.  When the conversion is exercised,  the shares are to be obtained from contingent capital established by resolution of the Annual General Meeting of adidas AG on May 8,  2003.  adidas International Finance
B. V.  is entitled to repay the convertible bond fully on or after October 8,  2009 although,  in the

­ eriod from October 8,  2009 through October 7,  2015 only to the extent the market value of the
shares of adidas AG amounts to at least 130% (period from October 8,  2009 through October 72012) or 115% (period from October 8,  2012 through October 7,  2015) of the conversion price
valid at that time over a certain reference period of time (as set out in the bond conditions). 
The convertible bond was issued as a bearer bond and subscription rights of shareholders to
the bearer bonds were excluded.  The shareholders have no subscription rights per se to the
shares for which the holders of the bonds have rights,  due to security provided by contingent
capital.  There were 7999 bonds outstanding at December 31,  2006. 

»  Cumulative translation adjustments: this reserve comprises all foreign currency differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations. 
»  Hedging reserve: comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair
value of cash flow hedges related to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred as well as
of hedges of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. 
»  Other reserve: comprises the cumulative net change of actuarial gains or losses of defined
benefit plans,  expenses recognized for share option plans as well as fair values of availablefor-sale financial assets. 
Distributable Profits and Dividends
Distributable profits to shareholders are determined by reference to the retained earnings of
adidas AG and calculated under German Commercial Law. 
The Executive Board of adidas AG recommends a dividend of € 042 for 2006,  subject to
Annual General Meeting approval.  The dividend for 2005 was € 130 per share (but before the
implementation of the share split at a ratio of 1: 4). 
Currently,  203536860 no-par-value shares carry dividend rights.  It is proposed accordingly that retained earnings of adidas AG as at December 31,  2006 be appropriated as follows:
Appropriation of Retained Earnings of adidas AG € in millions
Retained earnings of adidas AG as at Dec.  31,  2006	
Less: dividend of € 042 per share	
Retained earnings carried forward

Due to the possibility of share buybacks,  the amount to be distributed to shareholders may
change,  as a result of the change in the number of shares carrying dividend rights,  prior to the
Annual General Meeting.

24 » Financial Instruments
Management of Foreign Exchange Risk
The Group is subject to currency exposure,  primarily due to an imbalance of its global cash
flows caused by the high share of product sourcing invoiced in US dollars,  while sales ­other
than in US dollars are invoiced mainly in European currencies,  but also in Japanese yenC
­ anadian dollars and other currencies.  It is the Group's policy to hedge identified currency
risks arising from forecasted transactions when they become exposed.  In addition,  the Group
hedges balance sheet risks in limited cases. 
Risk management is conducted by using natural hedges and arranging forward contracts,  currency options and currency swaps.  It is Group policy to have a high share of hedging
instruments,  such as currency options or option combinations,  which provide protection andat the same time,  retain the potential to benefit from future favorable exchange rate developments in the financial markets.  In 2006,  the Group contracted currency options with premiums
paid in a total amount of € 11 million (2005: € 27 million).  The effective part of the currency
hedges is directly recognized in hedging reserves and the acquisition costs of secured inventories,  respectively,  and posted into the income statement at the same time as the underlying
secured transaction is recorded.  An amount of negative € 4 million for currency options and
an amount of negative € 17 million for forward contracts were recorded in hedging reserves.  A
total amount of € 27 million impacted net income in 2006 (2005: € 19 million). 
The fair value of the currency options not being part of the hedge in an amount of negative
€ 9 million was recorded in the income statement immediately.  Paid ­option premiums (as part
of the total capitalized fair value) in an amount of € 14 million and € 31 million were deferred
as at December 31,  2006 and 2005,  respectively. 
The total net amount of US dollar purchases against other currencies was US $ 32 billion
and US $ 18 billion in the years ending December 31,  2006 and 2005,  respectively. 
The notional amounts of all outstanding currency hedging instruments,  which are mainly
related to cash flow hedges,  are summarized in the following table:

› Notes to the Consolidated Balance Sheet 
The comparatively high amount of forward contracts is primarily due to currency swaps for

The total negative net fair value of € 17 million of forward contracts related to hedging instruments falling under hedge accounting as per definition of IAS 39 and was recorded in hedging
reserve.  The remaining negative fair value of € 2 million related to liquidity swaps for cash
management purposes was recorded in the income statement immediately.  The total fair value
of outstanding currency options related to cash flow hedges. 
The fair value adjustments of outstanding cash flow hedges for forecasted sales will be
reported in the income statement when the forecasted sales transaction is recorded,  the wide
majority being forecasted for 2007.  Inventories were adjusted by € 11 million as at December
31,  2006,  which will be recognized in the income statement in 2007.

Hedges of net investments in foreign entities were not renewed after maturity in January 2006due to the disposal of Salomon at the end of 2005.  Therefore a positive effect of € 3 million will
remain in hedging reserves until the investment in the foreign entity is disinvested. 
In order to determine the fair values of its derivatives that are not publicly traded,  the
adidas Group uses accepted finance-related economic models based on market conditions
prevailing at the balance sheet date. 

The interest rate options had a negative fair value of € 0 million and negative € 1 million as at
December 31,  2006 and 2005,  respectively. 
The interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps had a negative fair value
of € 7 million and € 10 million as at December 31,  2006 and 2005,  respectively. 
The risks hedged with fair value hedges occur from financing with private placements
in US dollars,  Japanese yen and Australian dollars amounting to a notional equivalent of
€ 105 million.  The aim of cross-currency swap hedges in Australian dollars and Japanese yen
was to turn the financing into euro and retain the financing method.  The intent of the US dollar interest rate swap was to obtain a variable financing.  The negative fair value,  which was
recorded directly in the income statement as incurred,  had an amount of negative € 11 million and was compensated by positive fair value effects of the hedged items in an amount of
€ 12 million. 
All euro-denominated interest rate swaps qualify as cash flow hedges pursuant to IAS
39.  They relate to euro private placements with variable interest rates in an amount of notional
€ 279 million.  The objective behind the hedges is protection against increasing short-term
euro interest rates.  The positive fair value of € 4 million was credited in hedging reserves. 

Management of Interest Rate Risk
The Group switched concentration from short-term financing to long-term financing,  due to
increasing interest rates in 2005 and 2006.  Therefore the Group is better protected against
future expected rising interest rates.  As in 2005,  no additional interest rate caps were ­entered
into in 2006 and maturing interest rate caps amounting to approximately € 530 million were
not renewed.  Interest rate swaps amounting to approximately € 279 million and cross-­currency
interest rate swaps amounting to € 10 million were entered into in 2006. 
Interest rate hedges which were outstanding as at December 31,  2006 and 2005,  respectively expire as detailed below:

The summary above includes,  in addition to the interest rate options amounting to € 50 millionthe notional amount of one long-term US dollar interest rate swap in an amount of € 76 million
(2005: € 85 million),  two long-term cross-currency swaps in an amount of € 29 million (2005:
€ 23 million) and three interest rate swaps for a total of € 279 million.  Both cross-currency
swaps and one long-term US dollar interest rate swap are classified as fair value hedgeswhile the three interest rate swaps are classified as cash flow hedges. 

Management of Credit Risk
The Group Treasury department arranges currency and interest rate hedges,  and invests cashwith major banks of a high credit standing throughout the world,  all being rated 'A-" or higher
in terms of Standard & Poor's long-term ratings (or a comparable rating from other rating
agencies). 
There is no concentration of risk due to a broad distribution of business with approximately 30 banks.  The result of the widely spread business is a maximum concentration of 6%
with one single bank,  whereas the average concentration is below 4%.  This leads to a maximum exposure of € 1 million in the event of default of one major bank. 
Generally,  foreign Group companies are authorized to work with banks rated 'BBB+" or
higher.  In exceptional cases,  they are authorized to work with banks rated lower than 'BBB+". 
To limit risk in these cases,  restrictions such as limited amounts of cash deposits with these
banks are stipulated.

As a result of the acquisition of Reebok International Ltd.  (USA) and its subsidiaries that was
accounted for under the purchase method (see Note 5) deferred tax liabilities were recorded
representing the difference between the book value and the tax basis of acquired assets. 
The actual existing and unused accumulated tax loss carryforwards of the Group

­ mounted to € 156 million and € 47 million for the years ending December 31,  2006 and 2005respectively.  The increase of € 109 million results for the most part from the acquisition of
Reebok and mainly relates to the effects of the acquisition on Reebok's U.S.  tax position. 
Deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that the realization of the related
benefit is probable.  Based on the past performance and the prospects of the respective business for the foreseeable future,  valuation allowances are established where this criterion is
not met. 
Valuation allowances,  which refer to deferred tax assets of companies whose realization
of the related tax benefits is not probable increased by € 46 million from December 31,  2005
to December 31,  2006.  This increase mainly relates to unused foreign tax credits of Reebok
International Ltd.  (USA),  which expire in a relatively short period and cannot be carried forward ­indefinitely.  These amounts were mainly part of the opening balance of Reebok International Ltd.  (USA) as at January 31,  2006.  Remaining valuation allowances relate to deferred
tax ­assets of companies operating in certain emerging markets,  since the realization of the
related benefit is not considered probable.

› Notes to the Consolidated Income Statement 
The Group does not recognize deferred tax liabilities for unremitted earnings of non-German
subsidiaries to the extent that they are expected to be permanently invested in international
operations.  These earnings,  the amount of which cannot be practicably computed,  could become subject to additional tax if they were remitted as dividends or if the Group were to sell its
shareholdings in the subsidiaries. 
Tax Expenses
Tax expenses are split as follows:

29 » Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net income attributable to share­holders
by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year.  Due to the share splitconducted in June 2006,  all numbers of shares have been restated by multiplying them by
four. 
Dilutive potential shares have arisen under the Management Share Option Plan (MSOP)
of adidas AG,  which was implemented in 1999 (see Note 33).  As the required performance
criteria for the exercise of the stock options of all tranches of the share option plan have been
fulfilled,  dilutive potential shares impact the diluted earnings per share calculation. 
It is also necessary to include dilutive potential shares arising from the convertible bond
issuance in October 2003 in the calculation of diluted earnings per share as at December 312006 and 2005,  respectively,  as the required conversion criteria were fulfilled at the balance
sheet date (see Note 16).  The convertible bond is assumed to have been converted into ordinary
shares and the net income is adjusted to eliminate the interest expense less the tax effect.

30 » Segmental Information
The Group operates predominately in one industry segment,  the design,  wholesale and marketing of athletic and sports lifestyle products.  The Group is currently managed by brands. 
Certain functions of the Group are centralized and an allocation of these functions to
specific segments is not considered to be meaningful.  This includes mainly central treasuryworldwide sourcing as well as other headquarter departments.  Assets,  ­liabilities,  income and
expenses relating to these corporate functions are presented in the HQ/Consolidation column
together with non-allocable items and intersegment eliminations. 
In comparison to the financial year 2005 there is a new separate segment for the ­acquired
Reebok business which includes the brands Reebok,  Rbk Hockey,  CCM and Rockport.  The
Greg Norman license,  which was acquired with the Reebok business and subsequently sold
in November 2006,  was allocated to the TaylorMade-adidas Golf segment.  Both the NBA and
Liverpool licensed businesses were transferred to brand adidas in 2006. 
Information about the Group's segments in accordance with the management approach
is presented on the following page. 
There are no intersegment sales between the brands.  Net sales to third parties are shown
in the geographic market in which the revenues are realized.  The global sourcing function is
included in the HQ/Consolidation column.  Transactions between the segments are based on
the dealing-at-arm's-length principle. 
Segment assets include all operating assets and comprise mainly accounts receivableinventory as well as property,  plant and equipment and intangible assets.  Segment liabilities
comprise operating liabilities and consist principally of trade and other payables and accrued
liabilities and provisions.  Non-allocable items include financial assets,  assets and liabilities
relating to income taxes and borrowings,  which are included in the HQ/Consolidation column. 
Capital expenditure,  amortization and depreciation relate to segment assets; the acquisition of goodwill and the inception of finance leases do not affect capital expenditure.

1) In the table the exercise period is relevant,  not the payment date. 
2) Due to the share split effective May 2006,  one option is now equivalent to four shares (see also Note 22). 

The expense recognized in the income statement for 2006 arising from share-based payment
transactions amounted to € 0 million (2005: € 05 million) and is recorded within the operating
expenses.  The contra-entry to the expense was recorded in equity. 
The remaining contractual lives for stock options outstanding at the end of the period
are presented as follows: Tranche II (2000) until July 2007,  Tranche III (2001) untill July 2008Tranche IV (2002) until July 2009 and Tranche V (2003) until July 2010. 
For stock options outstanding at the end of the period it is not possible to disclose the
range of exercise prices because they are dependent on future share prices. 
No stock options were issued during the year under review. 
The stock options may only be exercised subject to the attainment of at least one of the
following performance objectives:
(1) Absolute Performance: During the period between the issuance and exercise of the stock
options,  the stock market price for the adidas AG share calculated upon the basis of the total
shareholder return approach has increased by an annual average of at least 8%. 
(2) Relative Performance: During the same period,  the stock market price for the adidas AG
share must have developed by an annual average of 1% more favorably than the stock market
prices of a basket of competitors of the adidas Group globally and in absolute terms may not
have fallen. 

The stock options may only be exercised against payment of the exercise price.  The exercise
price corresponds to the arithmetical mean of the closing prices of the adidas AG share over
the last 20 trading days of the respective exercise period,  less a discount,  which is composed
of the absolute and relative performance components.  In any case,  the exercise price shall be
at least the lowest issue price as stated in § 9 section 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act
(AktG),  currently € 100 (i, e.  € 400 per option). 
The option terms and conditions stipulate that the stock options may be used for existing
common shares in lieu of new shares from the contingent capital,  or in the place of common
shares the discount is paid in cash. 
The new shares participate in profits from the beginning of the year in which they are
issued.

Retro products that continue to be in demand because of their authentic unique heritage
style. 

adidas1
Innovative,  customizable adidas footwear concept featuring a built-in microprocessor that

­ utomatically and continuously adjusts the cushioning level to the needs of athletes and
changing surface conditions (first intelligent footwear). 

Clearance Sales
Revenues generated outside the course of normal business terms,  arising from commercial
decisions by management to clear excess stock usually through specific channels and at a
significant discount. 

American Depositary Receipt (ADR)
 US-traded negotiable certificate of a foreign-based company held by a US bank that entitles
the holder to all dividends and rights of the underlying stock.  ADRs are traded similarly to
stocks on US exchanges and provide a way for Americans to invest in foreign-based companies
by buying their shares in the USA instead of through an overseas exchange. 

Clima
adidas apparel system encompassing the ClimaCool®,  ClimaLite®,  ClimaWarm® and

­ limaProof® technologies.  ClimaCool® is an integrated system of technologies that work together to regulate the athlete's body temperature.  ClimaCool® is also utilized as a cooling
system in footwear.  ClimaLite® fabric pulls sweat away from the skin to the outer fabric face
for quick evaporation,  enhancing the body's natural temperature regulation.  ClimaWarm® is
lightweight,  breathable insulation that keeps the athlete dry and comfortable in cold weather
conditions.  ClimaProof® is breathable weather protection that keeps wind,  rain and snow out
while allowing heat and sweat to escape through evaporation. 

Asset-Backed Securities (ABS)
Securities (bonds or notes) backed by loan receivables,  accounts receivable or other quantifiable assets. 
Asset Coverage I & II
The extent to which a company's non-current assets cover its debt obligations.  They are

­ xpressed as a percentage and calculated as follows:

performance-oriented consumers. 
Backlogs

­ eebok,  most orders are received six to nine months in advance,  depending on the season. 
This information is used as an indicator of future sales performance.

has a higher risk than the overall market.  Consequently,  a beta coefficient of less than one
indicates a lower risk. 
BOUNCE™

to reported figures by eliminating variances arising from currency translation,  thus reflecting
the underlying business performance.

assumed conversion of convertible bonds). 
Directional Accounts
