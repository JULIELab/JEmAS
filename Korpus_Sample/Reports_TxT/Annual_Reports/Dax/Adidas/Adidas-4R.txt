Interview with the CEO
The adidas Group took full advantage of its opportunities in 2010,  generating record sales and a substantial improvement in
profitability.  The strong operating and financial performance facilitated another year of significant debt reduction.  As a resultManagement is proposing a dividend to shareholders of € 080,  more than twice the prior year level.  In 2010,  the adidas Group
also outlined its most comprehensive and aligned strategic plan to date Route 2015.  Through its premium brands,  leadership
in innovation and strong financial position,  the Group is expecting a mid- to high-single-digit top-line increase and 10% to 15%
earnings growth in 2011. 
In the following interview,  Herbert Hainer,  adidas Group CEO,  reflects on 2010,  discusses the strategic and financial outlookand explains why the Group is 'fit for the future". 

Herbert,  how has the Group performed in 2010,  and have you met your targets?

Was there a segment that particularly drove this performance?

After the financial crisis and economic difficulties of 2009,  we rebounded strongly in 2010
and can reflect on an excellent year.  The Group generated a record € 12 billion in salesgrowing 9% currency-neutral,  clearly outpacing our major competitors.  Group gross margin
was up 24 percentage points,  driven by less clearance sales and a larger share of highermargin Retail sales.  At the same time,  we reduced operating expenses as a percentage of
sales,  despite significant increases in marketing investments.  This led to a jump in operating
margin to 75%.  As a result,  our net income increased 131% to € 567 million and earnings
per share were € 271,  which was at the top end of our November guidance.  In terms of our
balance sheet and cash flow,  the development in 2010 could not have been better.  We shaved
35 percentage points from operating working capital as a percentage of sales,  reaching our
lowest ever level of 208%.  And our operating cash flow generation,  the most important driver
for the creation of shareholder value,  was an exceptional € 12 billion for the year.  This allowed
us to further reduce our net debt,  which now stands at € 221 million,  just one tenth of the level
it was 24 months ago.  Without question,  this year's financial performance is an outstanding
achievement.  Not only did we meet all of our initial expectations for the year we clearly beat
them.  This is a credit to the commitment,  focus and hard work of all our employees. 

All of our segments hit the mark in 2010.  However,  an obvious highlight was the performance
of our Retail segment where sales climbed 18% currency-neutral,  driven by an impressive
11% comparable store sales increase.  Particularly satisfying was the development of our
concept stores,  where comparable store sales growth was an even higher 14%.  While this
underscores the strength and desirability of our 2010 product collections,  even more so it
emphasises that the strategic direction we are taking to improve our proficiency as a retailer is
already paying off.  This segment's performance contributed more than half of the entire Group
profitability improvement in 2010,  as segmental operating margin increased 53 percentage
points to 189%.  The leverage we have in Retail is obvious.  And this performance should give
you confidence that our continued investment in this space will be a significant source of value
for our company in the years to come.

  To Our Shareholders 

  Interview with the CEO

Speaking of investments,  2010 saw a significant increase in your marketing expenses. 
Do you think it was money well spent?
Absolutely.  Firstly,  I am glad you haven't forgotten that I consider marketing an investment and not a cost. 
We increased total marketing spend to 133% of sales in 2010,  returning it to pre-crisis levels.  As with any
marketing investment we make,  I always scrutinise the returns carefully,  benchmarking our performance
versus our own expectations and the competition.  And the results,  no matter which brand I look at,  speak for
themselves,  as we seized the enormous potential I saw for our company to leapfrog the competition out of
the recession. 
Let's look at a few examples.  At adidas,  sales increased 9% currency-neutral to € 87 billion,  with our
performance in the football category standing out.  In South Africa,  we witnessed the most successful World
Cup we've ever had,  generating record football sales well in excess of € 15 billion.  Through our worldclass partnership portfolio,  adidas was front and centre on every podium with adidas long-term partner
Spain winning the World Cup.  The adiZero F50 was the top-scoring boot in the competition and one of the
top-selling football boots in the industry.  Another great example of marketing success in 2010 can be seen
in our strong rebound in basketball.  The Derrick Rose and Dwight Howard commercials,  supporting our
positioning as the fastest and lightest brand in the game,  have generated our highest sell-throughs in the
category for years.  And on the streets,  bold collaborations with the likes of Jeremy Scott and unexpected
campaigns such as the highly successful Star Wars Cantina spot,  have catapulted sales of our adidas Sport
Style sub-brands up 23% to a record € 22 billion.  adidas Originals alone now has over 7 million followers on
Facebook,  making it the most popular lifestyle brand in our industry. 
For Reebok,  investments to promote our new initiatives have also been a home run.  Reebok's sales
expanded 12% currency-neutral to € 19 billion.  EasyTone has been a magnificent hit with global
consumers and customers.  Supported by exciting campaigns and fitness testimonials such as those
with Helena Christensen and Kelly Brook,  we ended the year on the top spot in the toning category.  Even
more pleasing,  however,  is that we created a second engine for growth in 2010,  with the highly successful
launch of ZigTech.  This was driven by our largest ever online viral pre-launch campaign.  The commercial
success has been phenomenal.  Taking these initiatives together,  Reebok was among the top three selling
footwear brands during the Christmas period in the USA. 
We also made sure that our Other Businesses had the right support to reach their goals.  No more so than
TaylorMade-adidas Golf.  Sales grew to € 909 million in 2010.  And in doing so,  TaylorMade-adidas Golf
became the global leader in the golf industry in 2010.

fare in these and your other geographies last year?
 am pleased to report that the growth and successes of 2010 were broad-based and robust
in most of our key markets.  For North America,  we significantly exceeded our targets with
notable upticks at adidas and Reebok of 14% and 22% currency-neutral,  respectively.  Key
initiatives such as lightweight and Originals at adidas as well as toning and ZigTech at Reebok
resonated right across the consumer spectrum.  In addition,  our mission to build a strong
connection to the next generation athlete and to increase our prominence in the important
mall channel is taking shape.  In Greater China,  although sales declined modestly for the full
year,  we returned to growth in the second half,  with an increase of 10% for the six-month
period.  We dramatically attacked our inventory levels and rationalised our store base in 2010. 
And through the improvements we have implemented in our merchandising,  product offering
and operational processes,  I am confident we are now in a position to sustain this growth
trajectory,  at a time when some of our competitors are starting to weaken. 
Turning to other markets,  in Europe we significantly increased market share in 2010supported by a strong performance in the football category and our dominance in the region's
emerging markets.  Revenues in Western Europe increased 7% on a currency-neutral
basis,  primarily as a result of double-digit sales growth in the UK,  Germany and Spain.  In
European Emerging Markets,  Group sales increased 16% on a currency-neutral basis.  Russia/
CIS in particular was a major standout.  In this market,  which is predominantly own retailcomparable store sales increased 25%.  And we extended our commanding market share lead
in Russia,  with Reebok now the number two sporting goods brand behind adidas.  In Other
Asian Markets and Latin America,  sales increased 6% and 14% respectively in 2010.  Even in
Japan,  we grew against a difficult consumer market and,  in doing so,  extended our market
leadership position,  with an impressive 45% currency-neutral increase at Reebok being a
major highlight.

  To Our Shareholders 

  Interview with the CEO

Looking at your financials,  one thing that is striking is the reduction of net debt.  How
have you managed to achieve this and can you give us an update on your policies towards
capital management and dividends?
With the difficulties in the financial markets,  we set clear targets over the last two years
to significantly reduce our financing obligations.  And we have achieved this through our
commitment to increasing operating cash flow,  which was an exceptional € 28 billion over
the past 24 months.  With net debt at year-end standing at € 221 million,  the ratio of net
borrowings over EBITDA is now 02 times,  comfortably within our long-term guideline of below
two times.  In terms of capital allocation and capital management,  we will continue to maintain
 conservative policy towards debt management,  until we have seen a sustainable recovery
in the macro-environment.  In the short term,  we intend to largely use excess cash to invest
in our Route 2015 growth initiatives,  and to further reduce net borrowings.  In addition,  we are
fully committed to our dividend policy,  which was expanded in 2010 to a payout range of 20% to
40% of net income attributable to shareholders.  This year,  we intend to pay out € 167 millionup from € 73 million a year ago.  This equates
to a dividend per share of € 080,  which is more
than double the € 035 we paid last year.  By
striking the balance between investment and
shareholder returns,  I am convinced we will
provide significant value for our shareholders
over time. 

In November,  you revealed your strategic plan for the next five years called Route 2015. 
What is the rationale behind the plan,  and can you share with us the key aspirations it
contains?
When we are focused,  we are a formidable competitor to any brand that may choose to
compete with us and it is with this attitude and rationale that we have established Route
2015.  It is the most comprehensive and aligned strategic business plan this Group has
ever created and is based on our long-term mission to be the global leader in the sporting
goods industry.  This strategy starts and ends with the consumer. 
Our key aspiration in the plan is to outperform total market growth,  both GDP and sporting
goods market,  as well as our major competitors.  Because,  it is only by sustaining quality
growth that we will be able to unleash the incredible value we all know our Group can
create.  We aim to achieve high-single-digit currency-neutral sales growth annually over the
five-year period,  which represents a 45% to 50% revenue increase from 2010 levels.  From a
brand perspective,  adidas and Reebok will account for more than 90% of the increase,  with
the rest coming from our Other Businesses.  Our three key attack markets North AmericaGreater China and Russia/CIS are targeted to deliver 50% of the growth.  In terms of earnings
per share,  which will be the litmus test of our ability to create value,  we intend to achieve
 compound annual growth rate of 15% over the five years.  This will be achieved through
balancing the investment required to secure top-line growth,  and leveraging this through to
the bottom line.  As part of this goal,  we are committed to achieving an 11% operating margin
sustainably at the latest by 2015. 
There is absolutely no denying that the growth in sales and earnings which we are outlining
will yield unprecedented levels of cash flow for our Group over the next five years.  And,  I am
sure you will agree that this is how value should be created. 

Rising input costs and price inflation are currently two widely discussed topics in the
financial markets.  Do you foresee major impacts on gross margin from these risks?
These market forces are not just topical,  but headwinds we,  and indeed everyone in our
industry,  must face.  Let's look at the facts.  Raw material,  labour and transportation costs
have all gone up some quite excessively.  Take cotton as an example.  Prices almost doubled
last year,  and are still rising sharply,  up over 20% already in 2011.  To mitigate these negative
developments,  our Global Brands and Global Operations functions are working hard on
optimising our product creation,  manufacturing and distribution processes to bring our
products to market more cost-efficiently.  These efforts will provide us with some relief. 
However,  with the extreme raw material price increases towards the end of last year,  they will
not be enough to fully offset the entirety of the cost pressures.  Therefore,  pricing and thus
inflation in our industry is an economic reality.  When it comes to pricing power,  we can be very
confident.  Even in the midst of the worst global recession in living memory,  we have seen that
consumers will pay a premium for exciting,  new products from brands renowned for qualityinnovation and service.  We have those brands and those products.  And,  we have the marketing
prowess to support them and to further increase their desirability.  Ultimately,  the consumer
will decide and we will watch carefully how price and volumes develop over the year. 
Obviously,  for our financial results,  the most impacted metric will be our gross margin.  While
the above factors may end up being a negative,  nevertheless,  there are also other factors that
will play in our favour in 2011.  These include regional mix,  as we expect to grow faster in the
emerging markets,  and also the increasing portion of higher-margin own-retail sales.  As a
result,  we expect Group gross margin to remain largely unchanged in 2011,  in the range from
475% to 480% compared to 478% in 2010.  However,  if input costs continue to rise at such a
pace,  then the challenge will undoubtedly intensify and lead to further margin pressure for our
industry beyond 2011.

Will adidas grow in 2011 without any major sports events? What key initiatives and
product launches for the brands should we watch out for in 2011?

We have seen a strong turnaround for Reebok in 2010.  With signs that the toning market
is slowing,  can Reebok maintain its momentum in the near term?

Too much is made out of event versus non-event years.  Beyond the phasing of our business
between the quarters,  there is actually very little difference,  given how diverse the adidas
brand is today.  Last year is a great proof of that.  Outside of football and adidas Sport Stylewhich we already talked about,  we had outstanding growth in running and outdoor,  where
sales grew 8% and 21%,  respectively.  In running,  highlight collections such as adiZeroSupernova and Response all grew at double-digit rates. 

Yes,  definitely.  I can only reiterate what I said in November.  We have built our presence in
toning in the right way,  taking our time,  choosing selectively how and with whom we distributeand matching demand carefully with supply.  We have also remained committed to our
endeavours,  making sure we give our partners the right support to drive sales through to the
consumer. 

 also wouldn't say 2011 is eventless.  The sporting calendar is packed,  and with great regional
diversity,  which can only be good for a brand as global as adidas.  Events such as the Cricket
World Cup in India,  the Rugby World Cup in New Zealand,  the Copa América in Argentina,  the
Women's Football World Cup in Germany and the IAAF World Championships in Korea are
just a few we will leverage to our advantage this year.  The Copa América will attract half a
billion viewers alone in Latin America.  And don't forget towards the end of the year,  we will
start prepping for the highly anticipated London 2012 Olympic Games and the UEFA European
Championship 2012. 
At the end of the day,  our success in any year is only as good as the initiatives we have in place
to excite the consumer.  And I am extremely enthusiastic about our campaigns and product
launches,  which will show up everywhere in a big way in 2011.  In mid-March,  we will kick off
our 'all adidas" global brand campaign.  The campaign showcases adidas' distinctive presence
across and into different sports,  cultures and lifestyles fusing the worlds of sport,  music
and fashion.  We also have an incredible pipeline of products coming to market this year.  Take
running again.  With products like the adiZero F50 Runner and Clima CC Ride,  I expect we will
see growth accelerate in this cornerstone Route 2015 category and grow at a double-digit
rate.  In football,  the Predator has been completely redesigned to give maximum impact both
technically and visually.  It will also be fully integrated with adidas miCoach,  and you will see
it on the field of play with a new younger breed of stars such as Nani who just recently joined
the adidas family.  We will also build on our credibility as the lightest brand in the game of
basketball with the launch of the adiZero Crazylight.  And adidas Sport Style has another string
of intriguing collections,  including the first year of our own Originals Denim collection.

  To Our Shareholders 

  Interview with the CEO

More importantly,  however,  with every quarter the top-line drivers are becoming more
broad-based and,  indeed,  more international.  Our presence at retail is also getting bigger
and bolder.  And our partners are showing great confidence in the brand.  I only have to look
at our exposure at Finish Line in February,  where we ReeZig'd all 680 Finish Line stores in
the USA with ZigTech imagery for four weeks.  In 2011,  we are also gearing up for our third
key technology platform launch RealFlex.  RealFlex promotes natural movement and is
equally striking in terms of design and functionality as Reebok's toning and Zig platforms.  In
addition,  we will also re-launch Reebok Classics.  To support the Classics franchise,  Reebok
has recently announced a multi-faceted partnership with producer,  artist and designer
Swizz Beatz,  who will work initially on creative content to bring our new Classics positioning
to life.  The reaction to RealFlex and Reebok Classics has been really encouraging,  adding
further momentum to an already energised brand. 

Can you give us an update on your strategy for Other Businesses?
What kind of contribution do you expect from TaylorMade-adidas GolfRockport and Reebok-CCM Hockey over the mid term?
 see good growth potential and a lot of value in the Group's Other Businesses.  As we
announced at our Investor Day,  we expect to reach € 18 billion in sales by 2015 from
€ 14 billion today.  TaylorMade-adidas Golf as the largest segment will be the key driver. 
Here,  we will not only extend our market leadership in metalwoods,  but intend to take further
market share in irons,  golf balls and footwear.  In 2011,  TaylorMade is already painting the
game a new colour with the launch of the R11 driver.  The striking white colour of the clubhead
is taking the industry by storm,  with accolades from media,  Tour pros and retailers.  It's a
great example of the initiatives coming out of TaylorMade-adidas Golf,  and really epitomises
the energy and passion that we now have.  In the same vein,  at Rockport we have developed a
compelling strategy around walkability creating a clear point of differentiation in the highly
fragmented brown shoe market.  This will be highly visible in the coming months,  with new
lightweight technologies in our DresSport collection just one example.  And at Reebok-CCM
Hockey,  we will continue to bring together two important Group principles in a powerful and
impactful way innovation and validation by professional athletes. 

Taking everything we have discussed into account,  how do you expect 2011 to shape
up from a financial point of view?
As we begin our journey in 2011,  I think it is fair to say that the company has never been in
 better financial situation and is very well equipped to exploit the opportunities and master
the challenges of the future,  especially the rising input costs which we just spoke about. 
The feedback for our products and campaigns that we received from our retail partners
gives us great confidence that we can continue to capture share in an improving consumer
environment.  We forecast our Group sales to increase at a mid- to high-single-digit rate on
 currency-neutral basis and to reach new record highs in 2011.  Group sales growth will
be driven by all segments and brands,  as well as by expansion in all of our regions.  We will
continue our commitment to our brands by investing in marketing and controlled space in
order to secure brand awareness amongst our consumers and premium distribution partners. 
Nevertheless,  operating expenses as a percentage of sales will decline.  Therefore we project
the Group operating margin to increase to a level between 75% and 80%.  As a resultearnings per share will improve at a rate of 10% to 15% to a level between € 298 and € 312. 
We have every advantage a company could possibly desire strong brands,  premium productssuperior marketing assets,  tremendous global reach and distribution and a very healthy
balance sheet.  I look forward to 2011 as the first year of our Route 2015 plan.  In every sensewe are fit for the future. 

Herbert,  thank you for this interview.

Supervisory Board Report 
Igor Landau
Chairman of the Supervisory Board 
Dear ShareholdersAfter entering 2010 with cautious optimism,  the adidas Group can now look back on a year characterised by recovery and
success.  For the adidas Group,  this was a year of major sports events such as the FIFA World Cup and the Olympic Winter Games. 
Furthermore,  thanks to innovative products and marketing campaigns,  all of our brands met with a very positive response among
our consumers.  The Group grew in almost all regions.  The positive effects of the new organisational structure also contributed to
the significant improvement of the Group's results in 2010. 

Supervision and advice in dialogue with the Executive Board
In the past financial year,  we regularly advised the Executive Board on the management of the company and carefully and regularly
supervised its activities.  In particular,  we examined the legality,  expediency and regularity of the Executive Board's management. 
The Executive Board informed us regularly,  extensively and in a timely manner through oral and written reports,  both at
Supervisory Board meetings and in the periods between our meetings.  This information covered the Group's business policy as well
as all relevant aspects of business planning,  including finance,  investment and personnel planning.  We were also kept up-to-date on
the course of business,  the operational position of adidas AG and the Group (including the risk situation and risk management),  the
Group's financial position and profitability,  as well as all major decisions and business transactions. 
We were directly involved in all of the Group's fundamental decisions.  After in-depth consultation and examination of the detailed
information submitted to us by the Executive Board,  we approved transactions requiring Supervisory Board approval and in cases
where,  in our opinion,  review by the Supervisory Board was necessary in the best interest of the Group. 

20 

  To Our Shareholders 

  Supervisory Board Report 
We held five Supervisory Board meetings in 2010,  one of them in the form of a conference call.  In individual cases,  we passed
written circular resolutions.  In addition,  we held a meeting in February 2011,  at which we discussed matters relating to the 2010
financial year.  Apart from one meeting which one member was unable to attend due to an urgent business appointment that
could not be postponed,  all Supervisory Board members attended all meetings in the year under review.  The same applies to the
committee meetings.  The external auditor,  KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft (KPMG),  attended four meetings of the
Supervisory Board and all meetings of the Audit Committee.  The Supervisory Board Chairman and the Audit Committee Chairmanan ­ndependent financial expert as defined by the German Stock Corporation Act,  also maintained regular contact with the Chief

Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer between the Supervisory Board meetings and informed themselves on the current
developments of the business situation and major business transactions.  The Executive Board regularly provided us with detailed
reports for the preparation of our meetings.  After in-depth examination and consultation,  we resolved upon the Executive Board's
resolution proposals. 

Main topics discussed and examined by the entire Supervisory Board
The development of sales and earnings,  the employment situation as well as the financial position of the Group and the business
development of individual markets were presented to us in detail by the Executive Board at all but one of our meetings and were
subsequently discussed together.  Other Supervisory Board agenda items included numerous individual topics,  which we discussed
in depth with the Executive Board.  These discussions did not give rise to any doubt as to the legality,  expediency or regularity of the
Executive Board's management in carrying out its duties. 
At our February 10,  2010 meeting,  which the Executive Board did not attend,  we discussed in detail and resolved upon the 2010
Performance Bonus Plan for the Executive Board including the relevant criteria and targets as proposed by the General Committee. 
Furthermore,  we amended the wording of the Rules of Procedure of the Executive Board,  to be in line with the German Corporate
Governance Code,  and aligned the business allocation plan to the new segmental reporting.  Subsequently,  we resolved upon the
Declaration of Compliance which had been prepared in detail by the Audit Committee at its previous meeting. 
The main topic on the agenda of the March 2,  2010 financial statements meeting was the review of the consolidated financial
statements and the adidas AG annual financial statements as well as the respective Management Reports for the year ending
December 31,  2009,  as certified by KPMG.  We also reviewed the Executive Board's proposal regarding the appropriation of retained
earnings.  Following initial Audit Committee examination and consultation,  we discussed material aspects of these financial
statements with the Executive Board and KPMG.  Both the Executive Board and KPMG provided us with detailed responses to all
of our questions.  After having carefully considered adidas AG's financial position and the expectations of shareholders and the
capital market,  we approved the proposal submitted by the Executive Board regarding the appropriation of retained earnings. 
Following the discussion and resolution on the agenda items for the 2010 Annual General Meeting,  we dealt comprehensively with
the budget and investment plan for 2010,  which we subsequently approved. 
At our May 5,  2010 meeting,  the Executive Board reported in detail on the current business development and the financial
situation of the Group after the first quarter of 2010.  Furthermore,  we discussed the method and scope of the upcoming efficiency
examination of the Supervisory Board.  Additionally,  we dealt with the economic situation and the potential for development
of the Retail segment and the eCommerce distribution channel.  Following a detailed presentation by the Executive Board and
subsequent discussion of this topic,  we approved the transfer of shares held in FC Bayern München AG from adidas International
B. V.  to adidas AG. 

To Our Shareholders 

  Supervisory Board Report 

  21

The main focus of our August 3,  2010 meeting were the results of the first half year,  which were well above market expectationsas well as the anticipated development of business for the remainder of 2010.  Moreover,  the Executive Board extensively reported
on the IT strategy of the Group and we dealt in detail with the new provisions of the German Corporate Governance Code which
came into force in July 2010.  Furthermore,  we renewed Erich Stamminger's mandate as Executive Board member and approved the
conclusion of his new service contract prepared by the General Committee. 
At our Supervisory Board meeting held on November 3,  2010,  discussions centred on the report for the first nine months of
the year and the outlook for the remainder of the 2010 financial year.  Following the Executive Board's detailed presentation of the
strategic business plan 'Route 2015" for the years 2011 to 2015,  we focused on the medium-term business development of the
Group.  Furthermore,  the Executive Board informed us about the growth potential of the adidas Outdoor category.  Another major
point of focus was the report of the Audit Committee Chairman on the key contents of the Audit Committee meetings held on
September 29,  2010 and November 2,  2010,  which dealt with the Audit Committee's examination of the effectiveness of the updated
risk management system,  the internal control system and the compliance system.  The Audit Committee,  to which we have delegated
monitoring of the effectiveness of these systems,  explained that the systems comply with statutory regulations. 
At our meeting on February 9,  2011,  at which the Executive Board was present only part of the time,  we discussed and
approved the budget and investment plan for 2011 based on the detailed presentations provided by the Executive Board.  Following
 comprehensive report by the Executive Board,  we furthermore approved the sale of Herzo Base real estate.  We subsequently
focused on the objectives for the future composition of the Supervisory Board and,  in addition,  we also resolved upon the content of
the 2011 Declaration of Compliance.  Furthermore,  we resolved upon the General Committee's proposal concerning the amount
of the 2010 Performance Bonus to be granted to each member of the Executive Board. 

Report from the committees
In order to perform our tasks in an efficient manner,  we have five Supervisory Board standing committees and also the projectrelated Committee for Real Estate Projects,  which was established ad hoc in 2009 see Supervisory Board,  p.  18.  These committees
not only have the task of preparing topics and resolutions of the Supervisory Board,  they partly also make decisions on behalf of
the Supervisory Board. 
The committees' work in the year under review is summarised as follows:
–  he Steering Committee,  which is authorised to pass resolutions on behalf of the entire Supervisory Board in particularly urgent

cases,  did not meet in the year under review.  All Supervisory Board resolutions were able to be passed by the Supervisory Board as
 whole. 
– The General Committee,  which is responsible for preparing personnel decisions of the Supervisory Board and for submitting 
proposals with regard to the Executive Board compensation and also the contents,  structure and conclusion of the Executive
Board members' service contracts,  met twice in 2010.  A further meeting,  dealing with topics of the year under review,  took
place in February 2011.  At the meetings of the General Committee,  the resolution proposals on the criteria and targets for
the 2010 Performance Bonus Plan to be submitted to the Supervisory Board were prepared following detailed discussion.  In
addition,  the committee comprehensively dealt with the service contract to be concluded in connection with the reappointment of
Erich Stamminger as a member of the Executive Board.  Furthermore,  the members of the committee discussed the Performance
Bonus payments to be made to the members of the Executive Board for the 2010 financial year.

  To Our Shareholders 

  Supervisory Board Report 
–  he Audit Committee held five meetings in 2010,  and also one meeting in February 2011 dealing with topics of the year under

review.  The auditor and the Chief Financial Officer were present at these meetings.  The committee members focused on the
examination of the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements including the Management Reports
for 2009 as well as the discussion of the audit reports with the auditor and the detailed examination of the first half year report
and quarterly financial reports prior to their publication.  The auditor reported to the committee members in detail on his auditing
activities and results.  Furthermore,  the Audit Committee obtained the required auditor's declaration of independence and
prepared the Supervisory Board proposal for the Annual General Meeting recommending the auditor for the 2010 financial year. 
Together with the auditor,  the Audit Committee established the priority topics for the audit of the 2010 annual financial statements
and consolidated financial statements and resolved upon the assignment of the audit to the auditor.  In addition,  the committee
members focused on monitoring the independence of the auditor,  the auditor's qualification as well as the other advisory services
rendered and the audit fees.  In the course of the examination of the effectiveness of the updated risk management system,  the
internal control system as well as the internal audit system and the compliance organisation,  the members of the Audit Committee
were informed in detail on applied methods,  systems and the efficiency thereof through written and oral reports.  They discussed
these matters in depth,  inter alia with the auditor,  and assured themselves of the effectiveness of the systems.  Furthermorethe Audit Committee,  which under the Rules of Procedure of the Supervisory Board is also responsible for matters relating to
corporate governance,  dealt with the new provisions of the German Corporate Governance Code as amended on May 26,  2010 and
discussed the contents of the Declaration of Compliance to be issued by the Supervisory Board.  At its last meeting in the financial
year under review,  the members of the committee discussed the draft budget and investment plan for 2011 as explained by the
Chief Financial Officer.  The Audit Committee Chairman reported orally on the results of the Audit Committee meetings in the
following Supervisory Board meetings and furthermore regularly provided the Supervisory Board with written information. 
–  he Mediation Committee again had no reason to meet in 2010. 

–  he Nomination Committee also had no reason to meet,  as there are no Supervisory Board elections scheduled. 

–  he Committee for Real Estate Projects,  which had been established ad hoc in 2009,  also did not meet in 2010. 


Corporate Governance and Declaration of Compliance
In the past financial year,  we comprehensively dealt with the new provisions of the German Corporate Governance Code and their
implementation within the Group.  In the second half of the year,  the Supervisory Board examined the efficiency of its activities
including the collaboration with the Executive Board by means of detailed questionnaires.  Following the respective self-assessment
by the members of the Supervisory Board,  an external consultant critically analysed the results and presented them to the entire
Supervisory Board.  This analysis did not give rise to any doubts concerning the efficiency of the activities of the Supervisory
Board.  In the year under review,  our Supervisory Board members again had no conflicts of interest as defined by the German
Corporate Governance Code.  After detailed discussions on corporate governance topics within the Audit Committee,  we followed the
recommendation of the Audit Committee and on February 11,  2011,  issued an updated Declaration of Compliance pursuant to § 161
German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz AktG),  which is permanently available to shareholders on the corporate website
at
www, adidas-Group, com/corporategovernance.  Further information on corporate governance including the compensation of the
Executive Board and the Supervisory Board is contained in the Corporate Governance Report including the Declaration on Corporate
Governance

Examination of the adidas AG annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements
KPMG audited the consolidated financial statements and the Group Management Report for 2010 prepared by the Executive Board in
accordance with § 315a German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch HGB) in compliance with IFRS and issued an unqualified
opinion thereon.  The auditor also approved without qualification the 2010 annual financial statements and the Management
Report of adidas AG prepared in accordance with HGB requirements.  The financial statements,  the proposal put forward by the
Executive Board regarding the appropriation of retained earnings and the auditor's reports were distributed to all Supervisory
Board members by the Executive Board in a timely manner.  We examined them in depth in the presence of the auditor at the Audit
Committee meeting held on February 25,  2011 and at the Supervisory Board's March 1,  2011 financial statements meeting
during which the Executive Board explained the financial statements in detail.  At both meetings,  the auditor reported on the
material results of the audit with focus on the priority topics for the year under review as agreed with the Audit Committee.  The
auditor did not report any significant weak points with respect to the system for early risk detection and the internal control
system.  The auditor was available for questions and the provision of additional information to the Audit Committee and the other
Supervisory Board members.  Based on our own examinations,  we are convinced that there are no objections to be raised.  Following
the recommendation of the Audit Committee,  at our financial statements meeting we therefore approved the audit results and the
financial statements prepared by the Executive Board.  The annual financial statements of adidas AG were thus approved.  We also
discussed with the Executive Board the proposal concerning the appropriation of retained earnings with regard to the dividend policy
and adopted it in light of the position of the company and the expectations of shareholders and the capital market. 

In memoriam
We will always honour the memory of our long-standing Supervisory Board Chairman,  Mr.  Henri Filho,  who passed away on
December 25,  2010 at the age of 79.  As a member of the Supervisory Board from April 1993 and Chairman of the Supervisory Board
from April 1994 until November 2007,  he provided the adidas AG Executive Board with outstanding supervisory and advisory support
to the benefit of the adidas Group.  During his tenure,  the adidas Group became one of the global leaders in the sporting goods
industry. 

Expression of thanks
The Supervisory Board wishes to express its appreciation of the tremendous personal dedication,  the performance and the ongoing
commitment of the Executive Board,  the management of the Group companies,  the Works Council and all adidas Group employeeswhich was decisive for achieving the Group's excellent results. 

For the Supervisory Board

  Supervisory Board Report 
Corporate Governance Report
including the Declaration on Corporate Governance
Responsible and transparent management and company control orientated towards a sustainable increase in value are
the principles of our actions.  We are convinced that good corporate governance supports a sustainable increase of the value
of the company and enhances the confidence placed in our company by our shareholders,  business partners,  employees and
the financial markets. 

The following report includes the
Corporate Governance Report and the
Declaration on Corporate Governance
issued by the Executive Board and
Supervisory Board. 

Dual board system
In accordance with statutory provisionsadidas AG has a dual board system,  which
assigns management of the company
to the Executive Board and advising and
supervision of the Executive Board to the
Supervisory Board.  These two boards are
strictly separated in terms of membership and duties and responsibilities. 
Composition and working methods
of the Executive Board
Our Executive Board consists of four
members  see Executive Board,  p.  16. 
There are no Executive Board
committees.  The Executive Board is
responsible for independently managing
the company,  developing the Group's
strategic orientation,  agreeing this with
the Supervisory Board and ensuring its
implementation.  In doing so,  it is bound
to the company's interests and obliged
to achieve a sustainable increase in
company value. 

Irrespective of the Executive Board's
overall responsibility,  its members are
individually responsible for managing
their respective business areas.  The
CEO is responsible in particular for
leading the entire Executive Board
as well as for management of the
Group's business policy.  In addition,  he
is in charge of various fields such as
Global Sales,  Internal Audit and Social
& Environmental Affairs as well as
Compliance.  The business areas FinanceGlobal Brands and Global Operations
are each assigned to a different member
of the Executive Board.  The Rules of
Procedure and the Business Allocation
Plan of the Executive Board set out
the tasks and responsibilities of the
Executive Board.  These documents
specifically stipulate requirements for
meetings and resolutions as well as for
cooperation with the Supervisory Board. 
At the Supervisory Board meetingsthe Executive Board reports in writing
and orally on the agenda items and
resolution proposals and answers all
questions from the individual Supervisory
Board members.  Furthermore,  the CEO
discusses the Group's strategy and
business development with the Chairman
of the Supervisory Board on a regular
basis. 

Composition and working methods
of the Supervisory Board
Our Supervisory Board consists of six
shareholder representatives and six
employee representatives in accordance
with the German Co-Determination Act
(Mitbestimmungsgesetz MitbestG)
 see Supervisory Board,  p.  18.  The
Supervisory Board currently has two
female members.  Five members of
the Supervisory Board have many
years of international experience.  The
composition of the Supervisory Board
is characterised by a high degree of
diversity and comprehensive knowledge
of the industry resulting from the
different professional backgrounds of
the members.  The members of our
Supervisory Board neither exercise
directorship or similar positions or
advisory tasks for key competitors of the
company nor do they have business or
personal relations with adidas AG or the
Executive Board.

In accordance with the recommendations
of the German Corporate Governance
Code ('Code"),  the Supervisory Board
determined the following objectives for
its composition at the meeting held on
February 9,  2011:
–  aintain the composition of the

Supervisory Board including members
with an international background to the
current extent
–  aintain two female members on

the Supervisory Board until the next
election of the Supervisory Board in
2014
–  ncrease the degree of female

representation on the Supervisory
Board as of the next election of
shareholder representatives and
employee representatives in 2014;
the Supervisory Board strives for at
least three female members on the
Supervisory Board,  at least one of
them on the side of the shareholder
representatives
–  aintain the independence of all

Supervisory Board members while
considering the work relationships of
the employee representatives vis-à-vis
the company
–  onsider the age limit of,  in generalC
72 at the time of election. 
In addition,  further important criteria
for the qualification of the Supervisory
Board members such as expert and
industry knowledge as well as particular
knowledge of and experience in applying
accounting principles and internal
control systems,  are taken into account
when nominating suitable candidates for
election. 

26 

  To Our Shareholders 

Irrespective of the consideration of the
aforementioned objectives and criteriathe best interests of the company will
continue to play a decisive role for the
Supervisory Board when nominating
candidates for election.  The Nomination
Committee was provided with the
aforementioned objectives that are to
be taken into account when nominating
candidates.  Although the Supervisory
Board cannot influence the employees'
decisions concerning their Supervisory
Board candidates,  the Supervisory Board
also recommends to the employee
representatives that,  as far as possiblethey strive to consider the set objectives
with regard to the election nominations to
be made by the relevant employee bodies. 
The Supervisory Board supervises
and advises the Executive Board in
matters relating to management of the
company.  The Executive Board reports
to the Supervisory Board regularlyexpeditiously and comprehensively on
business development and planning as
well as the risk situation and coordinates
the strategy of the company and its
implementation with the Supervisory
Board.  Moreover,  the Executive Board
provides the Supervisory Board with the
annual financial statements of adidas
AG and the annual consolidated financial
statements of the adidas Group for its
approval,  taking into consideration the
auditor's reports.  Certain business
transactions and measures of
the Executive Board are subject to
Supervisory Board approval. 

In order to increase the efficiency of its
work,  the Supervisory Board has formed
five permanent expert committees from
within its members,  which,  inter aliaprepare its resolutions and,  in certain
cases,  pass resolutions on its behalf. 
Those committees are the Steering
Committee,  the General Committeethe Audit Committee,  the Mediation
Committee in accordance with § 27
section 3 MitbestG and the Nomination
Committee.  In addition,  a committee
responsible for the handling of real
estate matters was established ad hoc
in 2009.  The chairmen of the committees
report to the entire Supervisory Board on
the results of the committee work on a
regular basis. 
The composition of the committees
and their respective tasks can be found
on our website. 
Apart from the tasks and
responsibilities,  the Rules of Procedure
of the Supervisory Board and of the Audit
Committee also set out the individual
requirements expected of the members
and the procedure for meetings and
passing resolutions.  These Rules of
Procedure are available on our website. 
The activities of the Supervisory
Board and its committees in 2010 are
outlined in the Supervisory Board Report
 see p.  20. 

  Corporate Governance Report including the Declaration on Corporate Governance 
The members of the Supervisory
Board are individually responsible for
undertaking any necessary training and
further education measures required for
their tasks.  The company supports the
Supervisory Board members by offering a
professional training programme tailored
to the needs of the Supervisory Boardinforms the Supervisory Board regularly
about current legislative changes and
provides the Supervisory Board with
relevant specialist literature. 
Every two years,  the Supervisory
Board examines the efficiency of its work. 
In the year under review,  the Chairman
of the Supervisory Board and his Deputy
Chairwoman dealt intensively with the
efficiency examination.  The efficiency
examination was conducted through
detailed questionnaires.  The analysis was
carried out by an external consultantwho presented the results at the Supervisory Board meeting in November 2010
and chaired the subsequent discussion. 
Based on the discussion,  possibilities
for improvement were debated whichhowever,  did not leave any room for doubt
concerning the efficiency of the Super­
visory Board's activities. 

Avoiding conflicts of interest
In the year under review,  conflicts of
interest of Executive Board members
and Supervisory Board members were
not reported to the General Committeewhich is responsible in this case. 

Declaration by the Executive Board and Supervisory Board of adidas AG pursuant to § 161 German Stock Corporation Act
(Aktiengesetz AktG) on the German Corporate Governance Code
The Executive Board and Supervisory Board of adidas AG issued their last Declaration of ­ ompliance

pursuant to § 161 AktG on February 11,  2010.  For the period from the publication of the last
Declaration of Compliance to July 2,  2010,  the following Declaration refers to the German Corporate
Governance Code (hereinafter referred to as the 'Code") as amended on June 18,  2009.  For the
period as of July 3,  2010,  the following Declaration refers to the recommendations of the Code as
amended on May 26,  2010,  which was published in the electronic Federal Gazette on July 2,  2010. 
The Executive Board and Supervisory Board of adidas AG declare that the recommendations of the
'Government Commission on the German Corporate Governance Code" have been and are met with
the following deviations:
Deductible with regard to the D&O liability insurance (section 38)
The D&O liability insurance for the members of our Executive Board and Supervisory Board,  a group
insurance for a number of executives,  had not provided for a deductible until June 30,  2010.  With
effect from July 1,  2010,  a deductible which complies with the provisions of the German Act on the
Appropriateness of Management Board Remuneration (Gesetz zur Angemessenheit der Vorstandsvergütung VorstAG) was agreed for the Executive Board of adidas AG.  A corresponding deductible
was also agreed for the members of the Supervisory Board with effect from July 1,  2010. 
Agreeing severance payment caps when concluding Executive Board service contracts
(section 423 subsection 4)
In accordance with the recommendations of the Code,  contracts with a term of more than three
years provide for a severance payment cap.  We believe that for contracts with a term of up to three
years the short contractual term agreed in connection with further contractual provisions offers
sufficient protection from inappropriate severance payments.  Hence,  no formal severance payment
cap is planned. 
Age limit for Supervisory Board members (section 541 sentence 2 old version)
Composition of the Supervisory Board (section 541 subsection 2 and 3 new version)
An age limit for Supervisory Board members has not been set so far.  The Audit Committee and
the entire Supervisory Board discussed the recommendations of the Code regarding concrete
objectives for the composition of the Supervisory Board.  Subsequently,  at its meeting on February 92011,  the Supervisory Board resolved upon the objectives and also set an age limit for ­ upervisory

Board members.  The new recommendations of the Code will thus be met when appointing new
Supervisory Board members. 

Number of mandates of an Executive Board member (section 545 sentence 2 new version)
As the Executive Board member Herbert Hainer currently holds two supervisory board mandates in
Group-external listed companies and two mandates in supervisory bodies of companies with similar
requirements,  there has been a deviation from the recommendation since section 545 sentence
 new version came into force.  With effect from February 28,  2011,  Herbert Hainer will resign his
position at Engelhorn KGaA.  Given the long period of membership in this supervisory body,  the
amended recommendation of the Code can only be met following a certain period of ­ reparation. 

We regard this temporary deviation as justified.  As of March 1,  2011,  all Executive Board members
will meet the recommendation of the Code. 
Compensation of the Supervisory Board (section 546 subsection 2)
The members of our Supervisory Board do not receive any performance-related compensation in
order to exclude any potential conflicts of interest with regard to decisions of the Supervisory Boardwhich might influence performance criteria. 
Disclosure of the shares held by the individual members of the Executive Board and Supervisory
Board or financial instruments related thereto (section 66 sentence 1)
Insofar as no further statutory obligations exist,  we report the ownership of shares if it exceeds 1%
of the shares issued by adidas AG but we do not report this on an individual basis for the members
of the Boards.  Instead,  we publish the total holdings of all members of the Executive Board and all
members of the Supervisory Board separately in order to safeguard the Board members' interests
worthy of protection.

Suggestions of the German Corporate
Governance Code fulfilled to a large
extent
adidas AG complies with the suggestions
of the Code with one exception: Pursuant
to section 36 of the Code,  Supervisory
Board meetings should be prepared
separately by the Supervisory Board
members representing the shareholders
and by those representing the employees. 
The members of our Supervisory Board
meet for such preparation meetings if
required. 
Relevant management practices
Our business activities are orientated
towards the legal systems in the various
countries and markets in which we
operate.  We furthermore bear significant
responsibility for the environment and
for the people living in these regions. 
Performance,  passion,  integrity and
diversity are the values of our companywhich are actively lived by our Executive
Board members,  Supervisory Board
members and the employees in all areas
of our company. 
Compliance within the adidas Group
Our compliance system creates the
organisational requirements for
Group-wide awareness of the respective governing law as well as of our
internal rules and guidelines and for
ensuring their observance.  The adidas
Group perceives compliance as being
all-embracing,  orientated towards the
product cycle and extending from the
supply chain to the final consumer. 

28 

  To Our Shareholders 

Our Social & Environmental Affairs
team deals with the rights of employees
in the supply chain and coordinates
product safety standards.  Before our
products reach the market,  our Intellectual Property department researches
the technologies,  trademarks,  logos and
designs to identify possible infringements
of the rights of third parties. 
In order to ensure standardised and
exemplary actions and behaviour,  we
implemented a Code of Conduct in our
company,  which has been applicable
in all regions and business areas since
2006.  Guidelines for day-to-day behaviour
in everyday work are stipulated in this
Code.  The Code of Conduct is available on
our website. 
The internal compliance programme
includes,  inter alia,  consistently implemented web-based training which is
available to all employees worldwide in
ten languages.  Furthermore,  on a global
level we have designated local compliance officers reporting directly to the
Chief Compliance Officer of the Group as
contact persons,  to whom complaints and
information concerning possible compliance infringements can be reported.  In
the area of data protection,  we also have
 web-based training programme for all
employees in ten languages.  Additionally,  the Group has a 'Marketing Guide"
to raise our employees' awareness with
regard to data protection when in contact
with customers.  As a next measure,  additional online training programmes in the
fields of anti-trust law and contract law
are being prepared. 

Compliance with working
and social standards
The development of company guidelines
with regard to social minimum standardswork safety as well as health and
environmental protection and the
monitoring thereof at the production
facilities of the adidas Group and
its business partners is an integral
component of our company policy.  Our
Group has an individual Code of Conduct
for the supply chain,  the 'Workplace
Standards".  These standards  see
www, adidas-Group, com/sustainability are
orientated towards the conventions of the
International Labour Organization (ILO)
and follow the code of conduct of the
World Federation of the Sporting Goods
Industry (WFSGI).  They help us to only
choose such business partners who fulfil
the Group's Workplace Standards and
business practices in accordance with
our values.  We have appointed an expert
team specifically for the coordination
of compliance with and control of the
Workplace Standards.  We report on our
sustainability programme in this Annual
Report  see Sustainability,  p.  120 and
publish sustainability reports regularly.

Environmental responsibility
and social commitment
Sustainable actions are an important
requirement for management that is
successful in the long term and particularly embraces social and environmental
responsibility towards present and future
generations. 
With our 'Green Company" initiative
as part of our Group-wide environmental
strategy,  we combine all approaches
regarding climate protection and
resource conservation at our locations
under one roof in order to realise the
long-term goal of becoming a carbonneutral company on a global level. 
We promote the positive development of the regions in which our Group
operates by cooperating with charity
organisations in order to improve the
lives of local people by means of sports. 
Moreover,  we are involved in education
projects as well as science and humanitarian initiatives in various projects in
Africa,  Latin America and Asia. 
With the objective of producing and
selling affordable shoes for the poorest
of the poor,  we have realised a successful
pilot project in Bangladesh within the
framework of our cooperation with Nobel
Peace Laureate Professor Muhammad
Yunus.  The project is based on the
adidas Group's core competencies and
is positioned within the Reebok brand. 
Currently,  a feasibility study is being
conducted to examine to what extent
the project can be realised as a working
'Social Business" in accordance with the
scientific principles of Professor Yunus. 

Transparency and protection
of shareholders' interests
It is our goal to inform all institutional
investors,  private shareholders,  financial
analysts,  employees and the interested
public about the company's situation,  at
the same time and to an equal extentby regular open and up-to-date communication.  We publish all essential information such as press releases,  ad hoc
announcements and voting rights notifications as well as all financial reports

comprehensively analysed in 2010.  Within
the scope of this system,  strategic and
operational risks,  compliance-related
risks as well as financial risks are identified,  assessed and reported throughout
the company and cross-divisionally by key
decision-makers.  This approach aims to
ensure that significant risks are reported
to management in good time and that
appropriate measures for minimising the
risks are developed and initiated  see
Risk and Opportunity Report,  p.  158. 
Share ownership of the Executive Board
and Supervisory Board
At the end of the 2010 financial yearthe total number of shares held by the

Compensation Report 1)
For the adidas Group,  transparent and comprehensible reporting on the compensation of the Executive Board and
Supervisory Board are essential elements of good corporate governance.  In the following,  we summarise the principles of
the compensation system and outline the structure and level of Executive Board and Supervisory Board compensation.  We
are also reporting on the benefits the members of our Executive Board will receive if they resign from office or retire. 

Compensation system for
the Executive Board
Following preparation by the General
Committee,  the compensation system
for our Executive Board and the total
compensation of each member of
the Executive Board is determined
and regularly reviewed by the entire
Supervisory Board.  The compensation
system and compensation level are
intended to form an incentive for
sustainable long-term management. 
The compensation of the Executive
Board members is designed to reflect
the size and global orientation of the
company as well as its economic
situation and prospects and is orientated
towards the typical structure and level
of executive board compensation at
comparable companies.  Taking into
account the compensation structure
at the adidas Group,  the tasks and the
contribution of each Executive Board
member to the Group's success,  his
individual performance as well as the
performance of the entire Executive
Board are considered.  Thus,  an
appropriate level of compensation can be
ensured. 

Components of the
compensation system
The target annual income of our
Executive Board members provides
for a fixed compensation component
amounting to around 35% and a variablei, e.  performance-related,  compensation
component amounting to around 65% in
the case of 100% target achievement. 
–  he fixed compensation consists

of a contractually agreednon-performance-related annual
salary that is paid in twelve monthly
instalments. 
–  he variable compensation consists

of a Performance Bonus and a
compensation component with
 long-term incentive effect,  the
Long-Term Incentive Plan 2009/2011
(LTIP 2009/2011) measured over
 three-year period.  The variable
compensation components are
designed in such a way that the
incentive to achieve the sustainable
targets set by the LTIP 2009/2011 is
significantly higher than for achieving
the targets necessary for granting the
Performance Bonus.  Corresponding
contractual provisions ensure that this
weighting will also be maintained in the
future.

Corporate Governance Report including the Declaration on Corporate Governance.

  To Our Shareholders 

  Compensation Report 
–  he Performance Bonus serves as

compensation for the Executive Board's
performance in the past financial year
in line with the short-term development
of the company.  It is determined by
the Supervisory Board in a two-stage
process: At the beginning of the 2010
financial year,  the Supervisory Board
determined as performance criteria
both the business-related criteria
(increase in income before taxes
and retail margin) and the individual
performance of each Executive Board
member and defined explicit targets. 
The target achievement of businessrelated criteria can be rated with a
maximum of 150%.  At the end of the
financial year,  the Supervisory Board
stipulates a concrete bonus for each
Executive Board member depending
on the respective degree of target
achievement. 
–  he bonus resulting from the LTIP

2009/2011 (LTIP Bonus) serves as
compensation for the long-term
performance of the Executive Board in
line with corporate planning. 

When determining the LTIP 2009/2011
of the Executive Board members,  the
Supervisory Board defined the following
performance criteria with different
weightings:
–  ncrease of consolidated net income

–  eduction of net debt (adjusted for

non-operating effects)
–  ales growth with regard to the

Reebok,  Rockport and Reebok-CCM
Hockey brands
–  bsolute and relative share price

development. 
When calculating the LTIP Bonus payable
following the three-year period,  the
degrees of target achievement of the
performance criteria are accumulated
and multiplied by the individual
target amount.  The payout of the
LTIP 2009/2011,  which is limited to a
maximum of 150% of the individual target
amount (Cap),  will be effected following
the adoption of the annual financial
statements for the period ending on
December 31,  2011.  Should the degree
of target achievement for the three-year
period lie below the threshold value of
50%,  the Executive Board members are
not entitled to the LTIP Bonus. 
 compensation component resulting
from a management share option plan
does not exist and is not planned. 

Executive Board compensation in detail
The total compensation paid to our
Executive Board in the 2010 financial
year amounted to € 11494 million (2009:
€ 10494 million). 
Benefits in case of resignation from
office as Executive Board member
All Executive Board members have
individual contractual pension
commitments which essentially include
the following provisions:
Pension commitments
The retirement pension commences with
the termination of the Executive Board
mandate upon reaching the age of 65. 
In the case of permanent occupational
disability or survivor's benefits in the
case of death,  different provisions apply.

totalling 10% of the pensionable
income,  a module of 2% of the
pensionable income is formed for each
full year of tenure as an Executive
Board member,  which currently
corresponds to the fixed annual
salary indicated in the adjacent
table. 2) The retirement pension can
reach a maximum level of 40% of the
pensionable income.

of an Executive Board member prior
to reaching the retirement age,  he

Commitments to Executive Board
members upon premature end of tenure
In the service contracts of the Executive
Board members Glenn Bennett,  Robin
J.  Stalker and Erich Stamminger,  a
severance payment cap in the case of
premature termination of tenure which
is not due to good cause is not provided
for due to the relatively short contractual
terms of up to three years.  The service
contract of Herbert Hainer,  on the other
hand,  which has a contractual term of
more than three years,  does provide for a
severance payment relating to payment
claims for the remaining period of his
service contract.  However,  the severance
payment has been limited to a maximum
of twice the overall annual compensation
(Severance Payment Cap).  In this
respect,  the overall annual compensation
means the overall compensation for
the last full financial year prior to his
resignation from the Executive Board
while considering the expected total
compensation for the current financial
year.  If the service contract is terminated
due to a change of control,  a possible
severance payment is limited to 150% of
the Severance Payment Cap.

  To Our Shareholders 

Commitments to Executive Board
members upon regular end of tenure
In case of regular termination of
the service contract,  i, e.  in case of
non-renewal of the service contract
or termination due to reaching the
retirement age,  the respective Executive
Board member is entitled to a follow-up
bonus as individually agreed.  This bonus
amounts to 75% for Glenn Bennett,  100%
for Robin J.  Stalker and 125% for Herbert
Hainer and is based on the Performance
Bonus granted to the respective
Executive Board member for the last
full financial year.  The follow-up bonus
is payable in two tranches,  12 and 24
months following the end of the contract. 
Instead of the follow-up bonus,  the
service contract with Erich Stamminger
contains a severance payment of 100% of
the last annual fixed salary in the event
that adidas AG decides not to renew his
contract although he would be willing to
continue his function as Executive Board
member under the existing conditions. 
In this case,  the amount is based on the
annual fixed salary of the financial year
at the time of retirement from office.  The
severance payment is granted instead
of the follow-up bonus.  The Supervisory
Board has aligned this contractual
provision to the system valid for the other
Executive Board members as of the 2011
financial year and set a follow-up bonus
in the amount of 125%.

benefits. 

Compensation of the Supervisory Board
The compensation of our Supervisory
Board members is determined by the

the responsibility and scope of activities
of the Supervisory Board members.

members receive fixed compensation for
their function as well as compensation
for the chairmanship of or membership
in committees.  There is no variable

Supervisory Board members who have
not been members of the Supervisory
Board for the entire financial year receive

committee with the highest compen­
sation.  The Supervisory Board members

in connection with their mandates as well
as for the VAT payable on their compensation,  insofar as they charge for it
separately.

To Our Shareholders 

  Compensation Report

Our Share
In 2010,  international stock markets and the adidas AG share increased markedly.  The improving global macroeconomic
environment,  strong corporate earnings and rising consumer confidence supported equity market growth.  These factors more
than offset the negative impacts from the sovereign debt crisis in the euro area's peripheral countries.  The strong recovery
in adidas Group sales and earnings as well as the announcement of the Group's strategic business plan 'Route 2015" drove the
adidas AG share up 29% in 2010,  thereby significantly outperforming the DAX-30,  which gained 16% over the same period. 
As a result of the increase in the Group's net income attributable to shareholders in 2010,  we intend to propose a higher dividend
of € 080 per share at our 2011 Annual General Meeting compared to € 035 per share in the prior year. 

International stock markets continue
prior year momentum
International stock markets,  the DAX-30
and the adidas AG share sustained the
positive momentum of the prior year in
2010,  continuing an upward trend with
investor confidence returning to equities
on relatively low valuations.  Over the
course of the year,  the adidas AG share
price increased 29%.  Our share out­­
performed the DAX-30,  but under­
performed the MSCI World TextilesApparel & Luxury Goods Index,  which
gained 16% and 44%,  respectively
 see   02.  The strong ­ erformance

of the latter was mainly attributable
­
to the high share of luxury goods
companies in the index,  which on
average out­ erformed companies in

the sporting goods sector. 

34 

  To Our Shareholders 

  Our Share 
At the beginning of the year,  international stock markets were spurred by the
continuation of liberal monetary policies
adopted by central banks,  improving
economic data points as well as positive
news flow during the 2009 full year
earnings season.  However,  throughout
the second quarter,  the emergence of
signals indicating a slowdown of the
global economic recovery in tandem
with the sovereign debt crisis in the euro
area's peripheral countries resulted in a
decline across all major global indices. 
In the third quarter,  market
sentiment reversed,  with most inter­
national indices gaining substantially. 
­
This was attributable to strong corporate
earnings announcements for the
first half of 2010 and the better than
expected outcome of the European bank
stress test.  Signs of sustained liberal
US Federal Reserve policies also contributed to the positive development.  In the
­
fourth quarter,  global equity markets
continued to increase.  Despite the
emergence of inflationary pressure
in China,  positive investor sentiment
prevailed due to an increasing number
of data points indicating that the global
economy and corporate earnings will
continue to improve in 2011. 

adidas AG share price reflects strong
operational improvements
The adidas AG share increased strongly
at the beginning of the year,  outperforming peers and the general market as
investor confidence in a successful turnaround of the Reebok brand increased. 
Although our 2009 results were well
received by investors and analystsmarket reaction to our 2010 outlook
was subdued.  Nevertheless,  in line with
rising equity markets and positive analyst
commentary which added to generally
improving sentiment,  the adidas AG share
reversed the downward trend towards the
end of the first quarter.

adidas AG share member of
important indices
The adidas AG share is included in a
variety of high-quality indices around
the world,  most importantly the DAX-30
and the MSCI World Textiles,  Apparel &
Luxury Goods Index. 
The DAX-30 is a blue chip stock
market index consisting of the 30 major
German companies trading on the
Frankfurt Stock Exchange. 
The MSCI World Textiles,  Apparel
& Luxury Goods Index comprises our
Group's major competitors.  At December
31,  2010,  our weighting in the DAX-30which is calculated on the basis of free
float market capitalisation and 12-month
share turnover,  was 169% (2009: 149%). 
Our increased weighting compared to
the prior year was mainly a result of our
higher market capitalisation,  which more
than offset a more pronounced decline
in share turnover compared to the rest
of the market.  Average daily trading
volume of the adidas AG share on all
German stock exchanges (excluding bank
trades) declined from 14 million in 2009
to 12 million shares in 2010.  Within the
DAX-30,  we ranked 16 on market capitalisation (2009: 17) and 23 on turnover
(2009: 22) at year-end 2010.  Howeverthe average daily trading volume of the
adidas AG share on alternative trading
systems increased more than 40% to
07 million shares versus 05 million
shares in 2009. 

3985

Conversion from bearer to
registered shares
Following the approval of resolution 13
at our Annual General Meeting on May 62010,  the no-par-value bearer shares
of adidas AG were converted to registered no-par-value shares (registered
shares) on October 11,  2010.  Since this
date,  adidas AG registered shares are
traded on the stock exchange under a
new ISIN DE000A1EWWW0 (previously:
DE0005003404) or WKN A1EWWW (previously: 500340).  The stock symbol ADS
remains unchanged.  The legal position of
the shareholders who are entered in the
share register as well as their holding in
adidas AG has not been affected by the
conversion to registered shares.  Furthershareholders' rights to sell their shares
or purchase shares are not limited or
made more complicated. 

3629

The preliminary announcement of better
than expected first quarter results at
the end of April helped our share price
to resist the general market ­ epression

throughout the second quarter and to
gain slightly.  Positive feedback from a
Reebok investor event in London as well
as our increased sales outlook for the
football category published in mid-May
also contributed to this development. 
Following the preliminary announcement of better than expected first half
year results in July,  the adidas AG share
price gained markedly towards the end
of the month.  The favourable momentum
was sustained after the final results
release in August,  and an increased full
year outlook helped the adidas AG share
outperform international indices during
the third quarter. 
In the fourth quarter,  strong third
quarter results as well as the sales and
earnings per share outlook for 2011
published at the beginning of Novemberwhile well received by most investors and
analysts,  did not provide further stimulus
to the share price.  However,  following
the announcement of the adidas Group's
strategic business plan 'Route 2015"
on November 8,  market participants
expressed their confidence in our Group's
medium- to long-term strategic goals. 
This was reflected in further share price
gains during the last weeks of the year. 
As a result,  the adidas AG share closed
2010 at € 4889,  representing a 29%
increase over the course of the year. 
This implies a market capitalisation of
€ 102 billion at the end of 2010 versus
€ 79 billion at the end of 2009  see   04.

Strong sustainability track record
reflected in index memberships
In recognition of our social and environ­
mental efforts,  adidas AG is listed in
several sustainability indices.  For the
eleventh consecutive time,  adidas AG
has been included in the Dow Jones
Sustainability Indexes (DJSI).  The indexes
analyse and track the social,  environmental and financial performance of
more than 300 companies worldwide. 
In addition,  adidas AG was again
included in the FTSE4Good Europe Index. 
This positive reassessment acknowledges
the Group's social,  environmental and
ethical engagement,  and encourages us
to continue and intensify our efforts to
improve our sustainability performance. 
Also,  adidas AG was again included in
the Vigeo Group's Ethibel Excellence
Sustainability Index Europe as well as
in the ASPI Eurozone Index.  The Vigeo
Group is a leading European supplier of
extra-financial analysis that measures
companies' performance in the fields
of sustainable development and social
responsibility.  Further,  the adidas Group
was included for the sixth consecutive
time in the list of The Global 100 Most
Sustainable Corporations in the World. 
This is a project initiated by Corporate
Knights Inc.  with Innovest Strategic Value
Advisors Inc.,  a research firm specialised
in analysing extra-financial drivers of risk
and shareholder value.  Launched in 2005the annual list of The Global 100 Most
Sustainable Corporations in the World is
unveiled each year at the World Economic
Forum in Davos. 

adidas AG historically outperforms
benchmark indices
The adidas Group is committed to
continuously enhancing shareholder
value.  The long-term development of our
share price reflects investor confidence
and the growth potential of our Group. 
Over the last ten years,  our share has
gained 196%.  This represents a clear
out­ erformance of both the DAX-30p
which increased 7%,  and the MSCI Indexwhich increased 154% during the period. 
ADR performs in line with
common stock
Since its launch on December 30,  2004our Level 1 American Depositary Receipt
(ADR) facility has enjoyed great popularity among American investors.  In
January 2010,  we removed The Bank
of New York Mellon as depositary bank
and appointed Deutsche Bank Trust
Company Americas to run our Level 1
ADR Programme.  Our Level 1 ADR closed
the year at US $ 3260,  representing an
increase of 20% versus the prior year
(2009: US $ 2715). 

The less pronounced increase of the
Level 1 ADR price compared to the
ordinary share price was due to the
appreciation of the US dollar during 2010. 
The number of Level 1 ADRs outstanding
increased to 64 million at year-end 2010
(2009: 54 million).  The average daily
trading volume decreased 60% compared
to the prior year.  Since November 2007the adidas AG ADR is quoted on the
OTCQX International Premier marketthe highest over-the-counter market tier. 
This electronic trading forum includes
leading international companies with
substantial operating businesses and
credible disclosure policies.  Further
information on our ADR Programme can
be found on our website at www, adidasGroup, com/adr. 

Dividend proposal of € 080 per share
The adidas AG Executive and Supervisory
Boards will recommend paying a dividend
of € 080 to shareholders at the Annual
General Meeting (AGM) on May 12,  2011
(2009: € 035).  Subject to the meeting's
approval,  the dividend will be paid
on May 13,  2011.  This represents an
increase of 129% and reflects the strong
improvement in profitability in 2010. 
The total payout of € 167 million (2009:
€ 73 million) reflects a payout ratio of
30% of net income,  as in the prior year. 
This is in line with our dividend policy
where we intend to pay out between 20%
and 40% of net income attributable to
shareholders.

Running 
Silvia Felt,  GermanCategory Manager Outdooradidas 
Four figures are my constant companion: 386,  1802,  42195 and 10.  In
other words: swimming,  cycling and running all in under ten hours.  And
at the end,  one sentence: 'You're an Ironman!".  These are the words that carry every athlete
who has successfully completed the Ironman in Hawaii over the finish line,  as they did for me
when I first took part in 2009.  It all began in 2004 when I competed in my first triathlon just
for fun.  Five years later,  I stood on the winners' podium as the third fastest woman in my
age category in the world's toughest triathlon.  In-between,  there was a long phase of hard
training throughout which adidas,  my employer,  supported me.  Job-wise I've achieved all
I ever wanted to achieve,  and on the sports front I have also celebrated numerous successes. 
Yet I still have one big goal ahead of me: to compete in Hawaii in the pro category.  You have to
train very hard in each single discipline if you want to complete the triathlon successfully.  Fail
in one and all is lost.  This means meticulous time management and discipline are extremely
important,  because at the end of the day you have to perform at your very best in three
different disciplines.  People often ask me how I manage to combine sport with a full-time job. 
I'm committed to both with heart and soul and always give my best.  And I'm proud to be part
of a brand that writes the stories of top athletes.  Because sport is my passion.

Football 
Aubrey Dolan,  IrishSenior Product Manager Footballadidas 
My sport: football.  My passion: winning.  My fascination: No matter what country
you're in,  football is a language that is spoken all over the world.  My motto:
Be better today than you were yesterday.  I started playing club football at the age of sixand right from the outset I had only one dream: to become a professional.  I played from sunrise to
sunset,  twelve training sessions a week,  in four different teams.  I'll never forget what it felt like to
win the Football Association of Ireland Challenge Cup twice as team captain.  I'm still in touch today
with my coaches,  team mates and former opponents.  Then,  in Germany,  I was given the opportunity
to work as a professional not on a football pitch,  but on the product side.  Ever since,  I've been
making sure that the professionals on the field of play are equipped with the very best products.  In
my job as Senior Product Manager in the Business Unit Football at adidas,  I'm closer to the football
stars than I ever dreamed I could be.  Together with my team,  we develop football boots,  right from
the very first idea to the finished shoe.  We always work closely with the players,  and so it was that
my biggest dream came true: In the summer of 2008,  I was able to work with my big idol,  Lionel
Messi.  When I met him for the first time,  all I had with me was a prototype of the new adiZero F50
shoe and I wanted to get his opinion.  Messi became a part of the team and together we developed
the most successful football boot of the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa.  Today,  I still train three
or four times a week.  This gives me the feeling I'm prepared for anything.  And it enables me to test
our products.  And live my dream in a different way.

The official match ball of the FIFA Women's World Cup 2011,  Speedcell stands for
speed,  power and team spirit.  It combines futuristic texture for perfect grip in all
conditions,  exceptionally stable flight behaviour through aerodynamically placed
grooves,  spherically moulded 3-D panels for perfect roundness and a 360 degree
sweet spot in one ball.  The design is inspired by the rotating,  fast and dynamic

Robert: In basketball,  everything is about team and trust.  And it's about
playing! That's why I love to organise open runs,  friendly games and tournaments for us
adidas ballers,  on top of my everyday job.  When we play together,  we are all united by the
same passion for the sport,  no matter where we come from or what language we speak. 
Through basketball I made great friends in this company and I am grateful to work for an
employer who supports us in living our sport. 

Vince: I literally was hooked on basketball from birth and I haven't
stopped playing since.  When you grow up in Brooklyn,  New York,  it's almost
impossible to not fall in love with the game.  As a child,  I played puff basketball in my room
and could not keep my eyes off the TV when the Knicks were on.  As I grew up,  I would see
the older guys playing in the park and would think 'I want to be as good as them".  At the age
of nine,  I joined a team.  Eventually,  the sport got me an athletic scholarship for college and
laid the ground for my future career.  Today,  I'm still hooked on basketball: I am fortunate
to be the Global PR Manager for adidas Basketball and regularly play with my colleagues in
our company sports basketball team.  Being among employees who share the same passion
for the game makes me feel at home even when I'm actually thousands of kilometres away.

Outdoor 
Zuzanna Asztemborska,  PolishSenior Product Manager Outdooradidas 
For me,  there's no better feeling than climbing a mountain as fast as
possible.  Standing at the foot of the mountain,  after all the preparations and planning,  what
counts for me first and foremost is the time.  My focus is on the athletic perspective,  following the
motto 'fast and light".  My speed on the mountain is also a safety factor,  especially in the highalpine area.  I go to the mountains to challenge myself,  physically and mentally.  Beforehand,  you
actually never know how a tour is going to end whether you will reach the top or not.  You never
know what the weather is going to be like.  That's what makes it so hard to compare performance
in the mountains.  What counts is your performance on a particular day,  in a particular place,  at a
particular time.  Basically,  it's all just a particular moment.  For me,  the thrill lies in capturing these
moments.  Risk is your constant companion,  it's an integral part of it all.  You have to be fully focused
at all times,  in order to identify and respect your personal limits.  Once,  I was on an expedition
on Ojos del Salado in Chile,  the highest volcano in the world.  I was climbing alone,  and extreme
weather conditions made it impossible for me to climb the last three metres to the top.  I decided to
turn back and yet it was one of my biggest successes.  It's not by chance that today I work at adidas
as Senior Product Manager for the Outdoor category.  It means I can test our products,  and from my
own experience I know what mountain sports enthusiasts really need.

Variety,  fun and a trained body these are the reasons that made me
become a fitness addict.  I like to define and shape my body through a good and
diverse workout.  What I don't like in my training is uniformity.  I've been exercising since
school and I can safely say: Fitness is an important part of my life.  I love the feeling a good
workout gives me.  After the workout I really feel a huge sense of achievement at reaching
my daily goal.  It amazes me how much I can push myself to the limit and give everything
that I can to complete the exercises.  This is a very powerful experience and a great belief
system to take away from sport into everyday life.  My lunchtime workouts are part of my
daily to-do list and I appreciate the fact that Reebok as my employer makes that possible. 
My gym kit is nearly as big as my wardrobe,  but my favourite product is probably the
EasyTone.  My role as Marketing Manager Women's fits perfectly to me as it revolves around
my passion: fitness.  I often have to take fitness instructors from different studios through

ZigTech 
Jeremy Bauer,  FrenchMarketing Director Market CentralReebok 
My job as Marketing Director is just like my fitness training fast,  intense and
diverse.  And that suits me down to the ground,  because what I don't like is boredom.  My job
always comes first of course,  but when I find time for training I need new challenges,  fun and energy. 
In sport,  I really want to exert myself,  reduce stress and be challenged.  Reebok ZigTechs play a big
role in my training.  I always have them with me.  They give me that extra energy kick,  as they did in
Hamburg in August,  in Germany's first Urbanathlon.  This fitness race involved running a distance of
10 km with 891 steps,  12 obstacles and 200 metres difference in altitude.  Whether running pros or
newbies,  you could tell that all 2000 participants knew this wasn't going to be a walk in the park.  I
had to scramble over containers,  navigate through a traffic jam and make my way over a five-metre
high halfpipe.  It felt like being in an action film,  and there were 15000 spectators cheering me on. 
Next year,  we're going to compete with our entire Reebok Market Central Marketing Team.  What
better team bonding can you have than training together and working towards a shared goal? I can't
imagine any other job that combines performance,  fun and enthusiasm for a brand and its products
to this extent.

ZigTech Nano
Reebok's ZigTech footwear utilises a unique
zig zag geometry that delivers energy transfer
back to a runner's stride.  The result is reduced
muscle fatigue in the shins.  In spring 2011,  the
next category-specific evolution of ZigTech
follows with the launch of ZigTech Nano: a
lower-profile version of the original ZigTechwhich offers a lightweight ride for the
more efficient running consumer. 

John Wall,  AmericanBasketballer: Basketball a game?


  igTech Track Jacket
Like ZigTech footwear,  ZigTech apparel is all about energy.  ZigTech apparel is
engineered with special fibres which are knit or woven into the fabric of each
garment.  These fibres are made with a collection of natural minerals that absorb
and reflect energy emitted by the body and recycle it back to the body through the
skin.  As this recycled energy returns to the body,  it helps to increase oxygen levels. 

It's much more than that.  It's a culture
and a lifestyle.  Basketball is the
dream of a lot of kids.  It's intense:
sprinting,  jumping,  and changing
direction quickly. 
You need a great deal of
strength and energy the
more you have,  the better
you'll play.  I'm a point
guard in the NBA,  so I'm
constantly moving around
during a game.  Whether
I'm dribbling,  passing,  or
scoring the ball,  I'm never
standing still.  My ZigSlash
basketball kicks give me
that extra edge of energy
 need.

TaylorMade-adidas Golf
 

Steve Olsen,  AmericanSocial Media and eMarketing CoordinatorTaylorMade-adidas Golf 
My job interview was a 50-day golf adventure across nine countries on
three continents,  that included more than 20 rounds.  I took on the Wear in
the World Adventure.  In June 2010,  TaylorMade-adidas Golf sent two candidates on a golf
adventure with the winner earning a position in the company's marketing department.  I have
been playing golf since the age of two and always dreamed of working in the golf industry. 
This challenge was my once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.  For me,  the Wear in the World
Adventure was part golf challenge and part growing as an individual.  It pushed me to my
limits,  both mentally and physically.  All the practice time at the driving range,  all the years
of playing golf,  it all led to this moment.  One of the greatest experiences along the way was
playing in Herbert Hainer's Pro-Am tournament with TaylorMade-adidas Golf PGA Tour
Staff.  I knew if I stayed focused,  I'd succeed and I did.  Being a part of the Wear in the World
Adventure and ultimately winning has been my greatest success in life.  I am 25 years old and
now have my dream job working for the No.  1 golf company in the world.

  Reebok-CCM Hockey 
Ice hockey is part of me it made me into who I am today.  It all started as a
life dream that turned into reality.  When I was four years old and started playing hockey my
greatest dream was to become a pro.  Making it into the NHL wasn't easy,  as many knock on
that door and don't succeed.  But to play for the Montreal Canadiens for sure was my greatest
success as an athlete.  After retiring from playing as a pro,  I had to transit from on-ice to
off-ice,  because I could not imagine my life without ice hockey.  When I was offered a job at
Reebok-CCM Hockey,  I was happy to have the opportunity to combine my love for hockey
with my everyday work life.  As Pro Product Director I work closely with the research and
development team to bring to market the best possible product for our pro athletes,  and
the great thing: I get the chance to test as many new products as possible and give valuable
feedback.  Currently I play with the U+ Crazy Light stick.  Having had the chance to play the
game at the highest level gives me an edge and advantage in understanding the business
better.  And it enables me to provide the best players in the world with the equipment they
need to play at their best. 

CCM U+ Crazy Light Stick
Still the lightest stick in its category,  the new U+ Crazy Light allows for quicker
reaction time,  a faster swing speed and a faster shot.  Two vertical and parallel
carbon bridges run the length of the blade,  enhancing the sweet spot from
the heel all the way to the toe. 

  CM U+ Crazy Light Skate

Built to meet the needs of today's best
players,  this U+ Crazy Light skate offers a
perfect fit.  Its Fluid Fit System creates an
environment of instant step-in comfort
for the foot prior to thermo-forming. 
Beyond comfort,  the U+ Crazy Light
is also CCM's most customisable
skate due to UForm-3D,  a technology
featuring highly heat-reactive UFOAM
material,  which moulds to the
3-dimensional surfaces of the foot. 

Sidney Crosby,  CanadianIce Hockey Player: The ref
blows the whistle,  it's the end of
overtime.  Victory.  You only feel the
pain once you leave the ice.  Everything hurts,  but it's outweighed by
the joy of winning.  At the moment
of victory,  everything is okay.  You
feel strong.  You and your team.  You
may work as a team,  but you can
still be the one who paves the way
to the top.  A good feeling,  and long
may it last!

Group Strategy
Our goal as a Group is to lead the sporting goods industry with brands built upon a passion for sports and a sporting lifestyle. 
Inspired by our heritage,  we know that a profound understanding of the consumer and customer is essential to achieving this
goal.  To anticipate and respond to their needs,  we continuously strive to create a culture of innovation,  challenging ourselves
to break with convention and embrace change.  By harnessing this culture,  we push the boundaries of products,  services and
processes to strengthen our competitiveness and maximise the Group's operational and financial performance.  This,  in turnwill drive long-term value creation for our shareholders. 

Creating shareholder value
Creating value for our shareholders
through significant cash flow generation
drives our overall decision-making
process  see Internal Group Management
System,  p.  126.  Therefore,  we are focused
on rigorously managing those factors
under our control,  making strategic
choices that will drive sustainable
revenue and earnings growth,  and
ultimately cash flow.  For each of our
segments,  we pursue the avenues for
growth which we expect to be most valueenhancing,  with particular emphasis
on improving profitability.  In additionrigorously managing working capital
and optimising our capital structure
remain key priorities for us.  As alwayswe are committed to increasing returns
to shareholders with above-industryaverage share price performance and
dividends. 

Based on our strong brands,  premium
products,  extensive global presence and
our commitment to innovation and the
consumer,  we aspire to outperform total
market growth (both GDP and sporting
goods market) and to grow our bottom
line faster than our top line.  In additionthe Group plans to lay the foundation for
leadership in the sporting goods industry
by outgrowing our major competitor
over the next five years.  The plan aims
at growing the revenues of the adidas
Group by 45% to 50% currency-neutral
from 2010 to 2015.  In addition,  the Group
targets a compounded annual earnings
growth rate of 15% and aims to reach an
operating margin of 11% sustainably by
2015 at the latest  see Subsequent Events
and Outlook,  p.  174.  To achieve these goalswe have made strategic choices and will
prioritise our investments under our six
key strategic pillars  see   01. 

Presentation of Route 2015
In November 2010,  the Group unveiled
its 2015 strategic business plan named
'Route 2015".  This plan is the most
comprehensive the adidas Group has ever
prepared,  incorporating all brands,  sales
channels and Group functions globally. 

Diverse brand portfolio
Consumers want choice.  Whether it is
the athlete looking for the best possible
equipment,  or the casual consumer
searching for the next fashion trendwe are inspired to develop and create
experiences that engage consumers
in long-lasting relationships with our
brands.  To maximise our consumer
reach,  we have embraced a multi-brand
strategy. 

80 

  Group Management Report Our Group 

  Group Strategy 
This approach allows us to tackle opportunities from several perspectives,  as
both a mass and a niche player,  providing
distinct and relevant products to a wide
spectrum of consumers.  In this way,  each
brand is able to keep a unique identity
and focus on its core competencies,  while
simultaneously providing our Group with
 broad product offering,  increasing our
leverage in the marketplace  see Global
Brands Strategy,  p.  87. 

Investments focused on highestpotential markets and channels
As a Group,  we target leading market
positions in all markets where we
compete.  However,  we have prioritised
our investments based on those
markets which offer the best mediumto long-term growth and profitability
opportunities.  In this respect,  we
continue to place a considerable
emphasis on expanding our activities in
the emerging markets,  particularly China
and Russia,  as well as building market
share in underpenetrated markets such
as the United States  see Subsequent
Events and Outlook,  p.  174. 

No matter in which market we operatewe recognise that consumer buying
behaviour and the retail landscape are
unique.  Therefore,  to fully exploit market
opportunities,  we tailor our distribution
strategy to present our brands to the
consumer in the most impactful way. 
This is achieved by following a distinctive
but coordinated channel approach. 
To this end,  we strive to provide our
customers with superior service to
secure prime shelf space for our brandswhile continuing our commitment to
building a strategic competency in own
retail and e-commerce  see Global Sales

Creating a flexible supply chain
Speed and agility are key to outpacing
the competition.  We are committed to
meeting the full range of customer and
consumer needs by ensuring product
availability in the correct size and colourproviding game-changing technical
innovations and also the latest high-end
fashion product to the highest quality
standards. 

 key strategic priority is to shorten
creation and production lead times by
continuously improving our infrastructure,  processes and systems.  By sharing
information from point of sale to source
and vice versa,  we strive to connect
and more closely integrate the various
elements of our supply chain,  to enable
quick reaction to changing consumer
trends.  To this end,  we focus on building
maximum flexibility.  While leveraging the
efficiency of common infrastructure and
processes,  the Group strives to provide
tailored solutions for all our business
models,  be it the wholesale or retail
channels,  or the performance-oriented
or style-oriented businesses  see Global
Operations,  p.  106. 

Develop a team grounded
in our heritage
Our culture is continuously shaped by
influences from the past and the present
as well as our future aspirations.  We
perpetuate our founders' commitment
to the athlete/consumer,  pride in what
we do,  quality and love of sport.  We win
as a team through open communication,  collaboration and our shared values
found in sport  see 'Shared values". 
Therefore,  we foster a corporate culture
of performance,  passion,  integrity and
diversity by creating a work environment
that stimulates innovation,  team spiritand achievement based on strong leadership and employee engagement  see
Employees,  p.  115. 

Leading through innovation
Everyone in the adidas Group is responsible for driving innovation.  Therefore,  we
foster a culture of challenging convention and embracing change,  and require
all areas of the Group to generate at least
one new meaningful innovative improvement per year.  In particular,  we believe
that technological evolution and cuttingedge design in our products are essential
to achieving sustainable leadership in our
industry  see Research and Developmentp.  110.  Beyond this,  enhancing services for
our customers,   see Global Sales Strategyp.  82,  and implementing more efficient
and effective internal processes are other
areas where our organisation strives to
innovate. 

Becoming a sustainable company
Like any global business,  the adidas
Group must manage wide-ranging
commercial and competitive pressure
to deliver increased financial returns
and growth.  At the same time,  we are
accountable for our employees and have
 responsibility towards the workers
in our suppliers' factories and also for
the environment.  We are committed to
striking the balance between shareholder
interests and the needs and concerns
of employees and workers and the
environment,  or,  in short,  to becoming a
sustainable company  see Sustainabilityp.  120.  We report publicly on the steps we
take to have a more positive impact on
society and the planet  see 2010 Social

Global Sales Strategy
The Global Sales function is responsible for the commercial activities of the adidas and Reebok brands.  The function is
organised in three distinctive channels Wholesale,  Retail and eCommerce.  By catering to these three business modelsthe Group aims to service multiple customer and consumer needs to fully leverage brand potential,  be more responsive
to market developments and manage channel synergies by establishing best practices worldwide. 

Global Sales defines strategic
priorities until 2015
The Global Sales function directs all local
market organisations responsible for the
distribution of the adidas and Reebok
brands.  The key priority of Global Sales is
to design and implement state-of-the-art
commercial strategies that ultimately
engage consumers with rewarding pointof-sale experiences. 
As part of our Group-wide strategic
business plan (Route 2015),  which
defines strategies and objectives for
the period up to 2015,  the Global Sales
function has defined three strategic
priorities:
–  ncrease the share of controlled space

to 45% of sales by 2015
–  mplement an integrated distribution

roadmap to ensure further growth
and maximise brand potential in key
demographic locations
–  upport growth initiatives in the Group's

three key markets North AmericaGreater China and Russia/CIS. 

82 

  Group Management Report Our Group 

Focus on controlled space
Our brands must be competitive at
the point of sale,  based on availabilityconvenience and breadth of product
offering.  As a result,  we are continuously
refining our distribution proposition
with a strong focus on controlled space. 
Controlled space includes:
–  wn-retail business

–  commerce

–  ono-branded franchise stores

–  hop-in-shops

–  oint ventures with retail partners

–  o-branded stores with sports

organisations and other brands. 
These formats provide us with a high
level of brand control,  as we either
manage the stores ourselves (i, e.  own
retail and e-commerce,  managed by our
Retail segment) or we work closely with
our partners (e.g.  for mono-branded
franchise stores,  shop-in-shops,  joint
ventures,  co-branded stores,  managed
by our Wholesale segment) to ensure
the appropriate product offering and
presentation at the point of sale.  We
intend to increase our controlled space
initiatives to 45% of Group sales by 2015. 
This will mainly be driven by growth in
our Retail segment and the expansion of
our own-store base as well as by growth
initiatives within our Wholesale segmentsuch as the expansion of our franchise
business. 

  Global Sales Strategy 
Integrated distribution roadmap
to increase brand presence and
market share
In order to increase our global brand
presence and ensure further growth of
our business,  our Global Sales function
has set up a comprehensive initiative
called 'integrated distribution roadmap". 
The initiative encompasses a joint
approach between our three channels
to identify where we want our brands to
be represented and in which distribution
format in key markets.  The initiative will
allow us to define how best to capture
the consumer in the biggest and most
attractive cities around the world without
cannibalising our brands and distribution
mix.  The roadmap is designed to ensure
market share growth in underpenetrated
affluent cities. 

Focusing on three 'attack" markets
As part of our strategic business plan
Route 2015,  the Global Sales function has
identified North America,  Greater ChinaRussia/CIS,  Latin America,  Japan,  UK
and India as key growth markets  see
Subsequent Events and Outlook,  p.  174.  Of those
markets,  the three attack markets North
America,  Greater China and Russia/CIS
are targeted to contribute over 50% of
the sales increase we anticipate over the
period.  To ensure these attack markets
receive the focus and resources needed
to achieve their goals,  these markets
report directly to adidas Group CEO
Herbert Hainer. 

Wholesale Strategy
The main strategic objective of the
Wholesale channel is to deliver profitable
market share growth by becoming the
leading sales organisation in the sporting
goods industry in terms of effectiveness
and efficiency  see   01.  To realise thisWholesale takes the go-to-market
strategies handed over by Global Brands
and commercialises them within a
defined framework across various thirdparty retail channels. 
Our most important third-party retail
channels are sporting goods chainsdepartment stores,  independent sporting
goods retailer buying groups,  lifestyle
retail chains and e-tailers.  In this respectWholesale strives to establish strong
partnerships with the most dynamic
retailers in their respective channel of
distribution by offering best-in-class
and tailored services.  The principles to
achieve this include:
–  ifferentiating and segmenting product

offering to match channel strengths. 
–  armonising and standardising selling

models and processes to achieve
efficiency and cost leverage and reduce
working capital requirements. 

Customer and range segmentation
to exploit market potential
Rolling out standardised product
range packages around the globe is an
important part of the Group's Wholesale
strategy.  The initiative,  which was first
designed and implemented in Europeinvolves a customer segmentation
strategy that facilitates the systematic
allocation of differentiated product
packages to groups of comparable
customers.  With 40000 different
partners around the world that operate
more than 100000 points of sale,  this
segmentation is broadly based on a
distinction between sports and lifestyle
retailers that either have an up-market
'brand-driven" positioning or a valueoriented 'commercial" positioning.  By
best suiting their specific needs,  this
provides a platform to better exploit
market potential,  while at the same time
supporting the reduction of complexity
and costs.  In addition,  our Wholesale
segment continues to partner with
retailers on increasing the level and
quality of sell-through information
the Group receives on a regular basis. 
This creates a mutually beneficial
understanding of their needs which
helps us to become a more valuable and
reliable business partner to our retailers. 
At the same time,  this helps us to drive
incremental business opportunities. 

Retail Space Management
to drive efficiency
Retail Space Management (RSM)
comprises all business models helping
our Global Sales function to expand
controlled space in retail.  Under the
premise that the selling process is
not finished until the consumer has
bought the product ('It is not sold until
the consumer has it"),  Wholesale is
cooperating with retailers along the
entire supply chain to bring best-in-class
service all the way through to the point of
sale.  By helping to increase profitability
per square metre for the Group's retail
partners as well as improving product
availability,  we can achieve higher
customer satisfaction,  thus driving share
of retail shelf space. 
The two predominant models to drive
the success of RSM for the adidas Group
are Franchising and Never-out-of-stock.

– Franchising: Mono-branded store
franchising is one of the Group's prime
growth opportunities,  as it offers superior
brand presentation.  Franchise stores
are financed and operated by franchise
partners.  The adidas Group normally
contributes to the costs for brandspecific fixtures and fittings each store
has to be equipped with.  Further,  we
support our franchise partners with
 comprehensive franchise conceptincluding range propositions,  IT systemstraining concepts,  and guidelines for
store building and store operations.  This
ensures that the quality of the brand
presentation and the service offered to
the consumer are at all times high and
comparable to our own-retail stores.

− Never-out-of-stock (NOOS): The
NOOS programme comprises a core
range of basic articles,  mostly on an
18- to 24-month lifecycle,  that are
selling across all channels and markets. 
Overall,  the NOOS replenishment model
secures high levels of product availability
throughout the season,  allowing for
quick adaptation to demand patterns. 
Retailers have to provide dedicated retail
space,  co-invest in fixtures and fittings
and commit to a 'first fill" representing
about 25% of total expected seasonal
demand to participate in this programme. 
In return,  customers can profit from
significantly reduced inventory risk on
these products.  Most NOOS articles are
on an end-to-end supply chain,  thus
limiting the adidas Group's inventory risk
as we re-produce following customer
demand. 

Harmonisation and standardisation
of processes to exploit leverage
Our Wholesale segment is constantly
working on further leveraging the size
of our Group and reducing complexity by
implementing best operational practices
across our wholesale activities.  The
harmonisation and standardisation
particularly of back-end processes can
help to further reduce cost through
simplified IT systems and applications. 

Similarly,  and already started in Europewe are rolling out a trade terms policy
that rewards customer performance
either by higher efficiency (e.g.  in
logistics) or better sell-out support
(e.g.  by point-of-sale activation).  As
part of this effort,  we have established
regular reporting,  delivering meaningful
benchmarks that allow us to tightly
control our third-party retail support
activities. 

Innovation key to accelerate
speed-to-market
Accelerating product creation,  while
reducing complexity is a key element to
gain competitive edge and ultimately to
increase shelf space at our customers. 
We have therefore developed a virtual
sell-in tool which allows us to continuously offer a holistic sample range to
our retail partners.  This is giving the
customer the benefit of having a 'full
range in his pocket".  The reduced amount
of samples used during the sell-in
process as well as the streamlined image
creation process increase speed-tomarket,  while at the same time reducing
costs.  This new tool has already been
piloted in several markets and is targeted
to cover 60% of all Wholesale pre-orders
by 2013. 

Retail Strategy
Our Retail segment's strategic vision
is to become one of the top retailers
in the world by delivering healthysustainable growth with improved return
on investment  see   02.  Retail plays
an important role for the growth of our
Group and our brands.  The reasons are
manifold:
–  s a place to showcase the breadth of

our brands (i, e.  concept stores)
–  o create distribution in markets which

do not have traditional wholesale
structures
–  he share of selling space via

wholesale is in decline due to industry
consolidation
–  verything we learn in own retail

benefits the rest of the organisation
–  eed for a clearance channel (i, e. 

factory outlets).

  Group Management Report Our Group 

  Global Sales Strategy 

  Wholesale Strategy / Retail Strategy 
Going forward,  we have simplified the
shape of our store chain,  by clustering
it into three different formats,  namely
brand centres,  core stores and factory
outlets. 
–  rand centres,  i, e.  large stores carrying

the full range of each of our adidas
sub-brands under one roof,  are the
bold and powerful statements about
their strength,  breadth and depth.  This
format will be kept to a limited number
and only in exclusive locations. 
–  ore stores are the commercial engine

for sales and profit across the Group's
retail organisation,  upholding and
accentuating each brand's reputation. 
There will be adidas brand core storesOriginals core stores and Reebok core
stores and,  depending on their sizethey will be categorised and clustered
into A,  B or C. 
–  ur factory outlets will facilitate

the controlled sale of excess stock
returned from our wholesale key and
field accounts,  franchise partnerse-commerce as well as own-retail
stores.  Through improved management
of regional inventory and limited
planned production,  we want to improve
and balance our product offering
and therefore further increase our
profitability. 

In light of the increase in importance of
retail to the Group's performance,  a new
central leadership team was established
in 2009.  This team is mandated to
develop a global strategic framework
and guidelines,  represent retail store
and market needs on a global level,  and
to act as a catalyst to drive commercial
performance for the adidas and Reebok
retail operations around the globe. 
To become a world-class retailerfour strategic pillars have been defined:
–  ocus on the consumer

–  chieve operational excellence

–  xploit portfolio of brands

–  everage our global presence and

scale  see   02. 
adidas Sport Performance
Core Store in Berlin 
By focusing on these four strategic
pillars,  we are confident to become one of
the top retailers in the world.  In line with
our strategic business plan Route 2015we will further invest in our own-retail
activities and will open over 500 stores by
2015 across the existing store formats. 

The majority of these store openings
are planned in the emerging marketsparticularly Russia.  Another area of focus
will be the further roll-out of Originals
core stores to increase the number
of distribution points for our apparel
collection,  and the implementation of
the new vertical business model for
the adidas NEO label  see Global Brands
Strategy,  p.  87.  To execute on these pillarsRetail has set its strategic priorities
around improving its delivery on the
'Five P's": People,  Product,  PremisesProcesses and Profit. 

People
The consumer and our employees are
the primary reference points in order to
be successful.  Retail constantly strives
to interpret and adapt to consumer
demand,  targeting a mix of new and
loyal consumers,  whether it be sportsactive,  sports-inspired or casual
consumers.  To make sure that consumer
needs are being met,  Retail will set
up organisational teams and recruit
store staff that are highly engaged and
commercially- and consumer-minded. 
We want to build a retail back office and
field workforce that thinks and 'trades"
like a vertical retailer and whose highest
priority is to serve the consumer.  To
achieve this,  in 2010,  Retail introduced
 new human resources people strategy
called SHINE. 

The aim is to leverage existing best
practices and create a single global
standard for the field organisation,  to
ensure a high availability of broad and
deep vertical retail and commercial skills
to develop our staff globally. 

Product
The key element of our product strategy
in Retail is to ensure that relevant
products are presented through the
Group's various retail formats to match
the intended consumer profile.  This
requires a product offering that is pricecompetitive,  simple to understand,  easy
to find and,  most importantly,  available
at the right time and the right place. 
To achieve this goal,  we will leverage
the product assortments,  concepts
and point-of-sale materials to match
real-time consumer trends.  Furthermorethe analysis of daily trading information
will provide the capability to display our
products in the correct proportionality
and thus increase our full-price sellthrough,  especially on best sellers to
'make the big bigger".

The start of a pleasant shopping

importance that our retail environments
are inspirational,  athletic,  fun and
interactive,  while at the same time being
laid out clearly and logically to make it
easy to shop.  In order to drive our sales
per square metre,  Retail has set a clear
priority on optimising its real estate

Processes
Streamlining and harmonising retail
store operations and supply chain
processes to gain the necessary speed
to respond to consumer requests
remains a top priority for Retail in
2011.  From a store perspective,  a key
initiative is to identify and promulgate
best-in-class operations policies and
procedures and ensure consistent
adoption to the new retail standards. 
Globally consistent manuals will provide
clear and commercial guidelines for
store development,  visual merchandising
and in-store communication procedures
to establish flawless execution and
operational excellence. 

86 

  Group Management Report Our Group 

We will also continue to work on adapting
the supply chain,  system landscape
and buying and demand planning
processes.  This is essential as we strive
to increase our in-season flexibility,  be
more responsive to changing trends
and to achieve economies of scale for
the Group's retail activities.  Shifting our
retail focus strictly onto the consumer
also means changing our mindset from
 sell-in (push model) oriented to a
more sell-through (pull model) oriented
perspective. 

Profit
To increase the commerciality and
profitability of the Group's existing retail
assets is the primary focus of all retail
teams,  whether they are working in
logistics,  store operations,  marketing
or any other Retail function.  Therefore
we will close down stores not reaching
their potential,  as well as closely review
and monitor each new store opening or
remodelling to ensure that the targeted
profitability and return on investment is
accomplished.  As part of Route 2015,  a
key area of focus is to increase four-wall
profitability in existing brand centres
and brand core stores.  To support this
strategy,  in 2010,  Retail introduced a new
set of operational KPIs benchmarked to
best-in-class retailers. 

  Global Sales Strategy 

eCommerce Strategy
At the beginning of 2010,  a leadership
team was put in place to define and
outline the strategic direction of the
Group's eCommerce activities for the
adidas and Reebok brands.  Although both
brands have made advances with their
respective platforms in recent years,  we
believe there is considerable untapped
potential for the Group in this channel of
distribution. 
As part of our Group-wide strategic
business plan Route 2015,  eCommerce
has defined its strategic priorities which
include:
–  stablish eCommerce as the third sales

pillar
–  alance Wholesale and eCommerce

activities by implementing a new
distribution policy
–  reate one consumer destination

by integrating brand,  shop and
customisation sites
–  uild a best-in-class technology

platform
–  rive attraction,  conversion and

retention by building enhanced
e-marketing capabilities. 
The success of our eCommerce strategy
will rest on our ability to attract,  convert
and retain the consumer in a crowded
marketplace.  To attract the consumerwe need to better optimise the visibility
of our site and how it ranks in online
searches. 

  Retail Strategy / eCommerce Strategy 
We also have to improve our
management of paid placement and
link our own site to social media to
attract larger numbers of the right
type of consumer.  To drive higher
conversion rates,  we intend to simplify
and improve functionality of our
e-commerce platforms to create bestin-class shopping experiences.  Finallyto retain consumers we will strive to
create targeted communication as
we gain a deeper knowledge through
improved CRM solutions that will allow
for more robust consumer interaction. 
In this respect,  social media will play
an important role as it facilitates
 deepening of the dialogue with
our consumers and a more evolving
relationship with them. 
With these initiatives,  the Group
targets to generate € 500 million in sales
from eCommerce by 2015. 

Global Brands Strategy
Global Brands is responsible for all the marketing functions and long-term development of the adidas and Reebok brands. 
The primary objective of this portfolio strategy is to ensure that our brands seize market and category opportunities through
well-defined and coordinated go-to-market strategies.  Each brand is responsible for the execution of its strategic focus by
creating a constant stream of innovative and inspiring products and generating communication strategies that represent each
brand and category in an engaging and compelling way with their target consumers. 

Driving the long-term development
of adidas and Reebok
To secure long-term sustainable growth
for the Group,  Global Brands is focused
on driving the development of the adidas
and Reebok brands.  The overall strategic
goal is to achieve qualitative,  sustainable
growth by building desirable brands in
consumers' and customers' perception. 
In 2010,  Global Brands played a central
role in the creation of Route 2015the adidas Group's five-year strategic
business plan.  The adidas and Reebok
brands are expected to deliver 90% of
the targeted growth for the Group in that
period. 

Areas within adidas and Reebok that
were identified as key contributors and
game changers for the adidas Group
include:
–  aining sales and market share in

the key global categories running
and basketball with adidas Sport
Performance
–  xpanding adidas Sport Style into fast

fashion with adidas NEO
–  stablishing Reebok as the leading

fitness and training brand
–  eading the industry in the fields of

customisation and interactivity across
categories. 

Focus on the consumer
The consumer is at the heart of
everything we do.  This is the first and
most important realisation,  and we must
adhere to it to deliver long-term success. 
As part of its function,  Global Brands
has mapped out our target consumer
universe which spans from our roots in
sport the pure performer through to
today's style setters who have embraced
sporting goods brands  see   01.

To be successful across consumer
segments,  we acknowledge that a
strategy of mass production or mass
marketing is no longer sufficient. 
Only by identifying and understanding
consumers' buying habits,  their fitness
level,  their motivations and goals for
doing sport and their individual lifestylecan we create meaningful productsservices and experiences that build a
lasting impression.  In this respect,  we
have identified five key global trends
which will be important to address with
our brands and sub-brands over the
duration of Route 2015:

– Celebrating individuality: Consumers
increasingly fulfil their desire to
differentiate from one another by being
more creative on the one hand mixing
and matching products and services they
need,  and on the other hand seeking
personalised offerings tailored for them. 

– Fit for life: Sport is no longer just
about competing and winning.  Sport is
becoming more embedded in consumers'
everyday lifestyles.  Motivations and goals
are becoming more holistic,  relating to
fun,  socialising and quality of life. 

– Back to basics: For everyday lifeproducts and services are desired to be
simple and authentic,  making consumers'
lives easier,  rather than complicating
things further.  There is a growing interest
in outdoor activities,  reflecting the desire
to reconnect and be in tune with nature. 

– Together is better: There is an
increasing need for meaningful social
interaction,  both online and offline,  as
consumers are forced to be more mobileand the rise of digital technologies makes
it easier for them to connect with likeminded people. 

– You are what you know and what you
do: Society is embracing a life-long
learning attitude,  and placing more
emphasis on what we know and do
versus what we have and where we come
from. 

88 

  Group Management Report Our Group 

  Global Brands Strategy 
To match these trends and fulfil
consumer demands,  Global Brands
teams will need to adhere to the following
principles:
–  reate the unexpected in terms of

product and brand experience
–  reate the highest emotional

connection between our brands and the
consumer
–  e prepared for the next generationB
anticipating change
–  implify to the maximum

–  how excellence in execution,  meaning

we have to make sure we are consistent
in whatever we do,  from the idea to the
communication at the point of sale,  and
in the worldwide web. 

Brand architecture and differentiation
We believe that our multi-brand structure
gives us an important competitive
advantage.  Through our brand
architecture,  we seamlessly cover the
consumer segments we have definedcatering to more consumer needs,  while
at the same time keeping clarity of brand
message and values.  In each case,  the
positioning of adidas and Reebok and
their respective sub-brands is based on
their unique DNAs their history and
their values. 
As a true global brand with German
roots,  adidas through its sub-brands is
targeting competitive sports based on
innovation and technology with adidas
Sport Performance.  This sub-brand is the
multi-sport specialist. 

Our positioning here clearly starts in
producing the best products for use
in specific sports such as footballbasketball,  running and regional sports. 
We then seek to leverage brand loyalty
and strength in innovation in other
categories.  adidas Originals and adidas
Sport Style leverage the potential in
sports lifestyle and fashion markets. 
Reebok,  conversely,  is an Americaninspired global brand and starts with
fitness and training as the backbone for
the brand's positioning,  especially for
active and casual sports.  Consumers
who identify with Reebok's values and
positioning will subsequently also be
attracted to the brand when they go for
 run,  or play basketball.  ThereforeReebok capitalises on the opportunity
to leverage its technology concepts
and designs also into specific sports
categories.  Reebok thus bridges the two
ends of the consumer spectrum,  from
performance athletes to style setters
 see   02.  Through these differences
in positioning,  we are therefore not
cannibalising each other in the marketbut rather challenging and supporting
each other as friendly competitors with
different target groups in mind.

For example at adidaspersonalisation is one of the brand's lead
innovation concepts,  and it is an adidas
goal to be the most personal sports
brand by 2015.  At Reebok,  innovation
focus is on fitness and training,  where a

Each brand and sub-brand is separately
responsible for bringing its respective
positioning to life,  through the creation
of products and communication tools
that not only support the commercial
functions in their day-to-day business
activities,  but also provide the platform
and framework for long-term market
share and profitability improvements. 
While adidas and Reebok each have
unique identities,  heritages,  technologiesdesigns and reputations,  the strategic
principles and methods for driving
future sales growth and profitability
improvements are common to both. 
These include:
–  eadership in product innovation

Marketing and communication
leadership
To be competitive in the sporting goods
industry,  brands must have a clear profile
towards their target consumer.  To achieve
this,  adidas and Reebok are focused on
creating inspirational and innovative
brand marketing campaigns and
communication techniques to build brand
equity and support the achievement of
the Group's commercial goals. 
 key tenet of our marketing and
communication strategy is to harness
the emotion of sport and the benefits
of a sporting lifestyle across all
communication channels.  Both adidas
and Reebok regularly bring new global
marketing concepts to life,  which can
be easily leveraged to create simple and
powerful brand messages and support an
array of product offerings.  For exampleadidas will use the 'One Brand Anthem"
platform to transcend its key categories
and sub-brands in 2011.  Reebok will
continue its global campaign,  which
will use the motto 'Ree" as a guiding
theme for the brand's communication
with consumers.  The key message
of the campaign is simple.  Reebok
'ReeDefines" sport and style,  bringing
fun and joy back into consumers' lives.

  Group Management Report Our Group 

In addition,  Global Brands also
endeavours to ensure all of its brands are
at the forefront of new communication
techniques,  particularly as information
flow becomes faster and faster.  Through
investment in digital marketing and
technologies,  both adidas and Reebok are
empowering and encouraging consumers
to interact in personal dialogues with
the brands.  Whether through in-store or
online customisation platforms,  digital
social networks or digital broadcast
mediums,  these methods are providing
a new scope of consumer experiences in
 real-time and cost-effective way. 

Activation and validation via a relevant
set of promotion partnerships
The utilisation of promotion partners
such as federations,  teams,  leaguesevents and individuals is an important
part of endorsing brand positioning,  and
an area to which the Group dedicates
significant resources.  This not only
serves as a vehicle to showcase the
credentials of adidas and Reebok
products in the performance arena,  but
also to facilitate the extension of the
adidas and Reebok brands in the sportsinspired lifestyle market.  Both adidas
and Reebok follow a partnership strategy
geared to best reflect their respective
positioning in the market. 

  Global Brands Strategy 
One of the guiding principles of adidas
is to equip all athletes to achieve their
'impossible".  As such,  adidas brings its
passion for great products to the biggest
stages in the world with sponsorship
agreements for the FIFA World Cup,  the
NBA,  the European Rugby Cup and the
upcoming London 2012 Olympic Games. 
In addition,  adidas has an extensive
roster of high-profile sports teams such
as AC Milan,  Liverpool FC,  FC Bayern
Munich and Real Madrid in footballthe New Zealand All Blacks in rugbyAmerican universities like UCLA and
Notre Dame,  as well as high-profile
individuals such as FIFA World Player of
the Year Lionel Messi,  football icon David
Beckham,  basketball stars Derrick Rose
and Dwight Howard,  marathon legend
Haile Gebrselassie,  athletic stars Tyson
Gay and Jeremy Wariner and tennis stars
Justine Henin,  Caroline Wozniacki and
Andy Murray. 
To activate and validate its key
concepts,  Reebok is partnering with
top women's and men's sport athletes. 
In Women's,  Reebok is partnering
with some of the world's top women's
fitness instructors renowned for their
inspirational approach to fitness. 
In Men's Sport,  some of the most
recognisable athletes support Reebokincluding Peyton Manning,  John Wall
as well as Lewis Hamilton.  In additionthe brand holds exclusive,  long-term
licensing agreements with the National
Lacrosse League in North Americagiving Reebok the exclusive rights to
manufacture and market both authentic
and replica uniform jerseys and sideline
apparel. 

Extending brand reach and appeal
through strategic partnerships
adidas and Reebok have both successfully pursued design and co-branding
strategies with complementary partners. 
For example,  adidas has partnered
with Yohji Yamamoto,  Stella McCartney
and Porsche Design,  designing sportsinspired fashion,  high-end functional
ranges or even luxury sportswear.  adidas
Originals continues to engage in unique
collaborations with well-known brands
such as Burton,  Vespa and Star Warsthat ensure adidas remains relevant to
the style-conscious streetwear consumer. 
In Women's Fitness,  Reebok and
Cirque du Soleil continue their strategic
partnership,  which has given rise to
inspiring new workout experiences and
product collections.  In fall/winter 2010Reebok launched its first collection with
Giorgio Armani S, p. A.  The global style
credentials of the EA7 and Emporio
Armani labels combined with Reebok's
fitness and training heritage and
technologies fit together to provide a new
perspective and concept in the global
sports style marketplace. 

adidas Strategy
adidas the performance brand
and multi-sport specialist
adidas' mission is to be the leading sports
brand in the world.  One major lever to
achieve this is the brand's broad and
unique product portfolio spanning from
apparel and footwear for professional
athletes to premium fashion.  It allows
adidas to address multiple consumer
needs,  exploit market opportunities from
various angles as well as be less affected
by one-dimensional market risks.  adidas'
commitment to product innovation and
its rich heritage differentiates the brand
from competitors and provides a solid
platform for future growth. 
adidas Sport Performance play to win
No other brand has a more distinguished
history or stronger connection with sport
than adidas.  adidas is everywhere where
the best meet the best,  like the FIFA
World Cup or the NBA All-Star Game,  but
also everywhere else around the globe
where sports are simply played,  watchedenjoyed and celebrated. 
Everything at adidas Sport
Performance reflects the spirit of our
founder Adi Dassler.  The main objective is
simple: make athletes better.  Thereforeinnovation is at the core of all adidas
Sport Performance products. 

The target consumers of the sub-brand
are clearly those consumers who call
themselves athletes,  are active in sportor simply are inspired by and love sport. 
While we have a pivotal strength with
the 20- to 29-year-olds,  going forward a
clear focus will be the high school athlete
and the 14- to 19-year-olds. 
adidas Sport Performance offers
products in most sports categories.  The
key focus categories are:
–  ootball

–  asketball

–  unning

–  raining

–  utdoor

Furthermore,  adidas Sport Performance
is focusing on interactive and
customisation as key growth drivers
across categories.  A perfect example
of this is adidas miCoach,  which is the
world's first web-based personalised
training service.  It combines state-ofthe-art training with a personalised web
service and real-time audio coaching. 
adidas Sport Performance
miCoach 

It is compatible with all MP3 players
and is available as an application on
various smart phones such as iPhone and
Blackberry.  miCoach is a clear highlight
of our focus on innovation to help make
athletes better and 'fit for performance". 

Five performance benefits
To be relevant to our target consumer
as the performance brand,  we have
identified five consumer benefits which
will form the basis of our innovation
pipeline for the next five years.  We
believe that serving these benefits will
keep us at the forefront of the industrybuilding brand image and allowing us to
leverage our technologies and positioning
seamlessly across categories. 
–  aster: To help athletes be fasterF
we will focus on reducing product
weight,  making the lightest products
on the market.  The franchise will
be built with the adiZero platform. 
Already prominent in 2010,  this will
be a key initiative for 2011 where we
will introduce even lighter products
in football,  basketball and American
football. 
–  tronger: With adiPower,  we intend

to create a franchise to own power
enhancement in sport.  This platform
will include products such as Predator
in football,  Barricade in tennis and
Techfit apparel.

trend in our industry.  Drawing on
our long history,  experience and
understanding of the shape of the
foot and movement of the body,  we
will create a new platform of products

five years. 

Football: expanding strong
market position
Being the most popular sport worldwidefootball is clearly one of adidas' key
strategic priorities.  For over 50 yearsadidas has led all major developments
in boot,  ball and apparel technologies. 
Building on its success around major
sporting events such as the 2010 FIFA
World Cup,  the brand strives to increase
its strong market position by continuously
creating the industry's top products and
fully leveraging its outstanding portfolio
of sports marketing partners. 
Partners include leading football
associations (e.g.  FIFA,  UEFA)events (FIFA World Cup,  UEFA EURO
Championship,  UEFA Champions
League),  national federations (e.g. 
defending FIFA and UEFA Champion
Spain,  Germany,  China,  Russia,  GreeceArgentina,  Mexico,  Japan),  leagues (e.g. 
Major League Soccer in the USA),  clubs
(e.g.  Real Madrid,  AC Milan,  Chelsea
FC,  Liverpool FC,  FC Bayern MunichRiver Plate Buenos Aires) and individual
players (e.g.  the adidas Golden Ball and
Boot winners of the 2010 FIFA World Cup
Diego Forlán and Thomas Müller,  and
also Lionel Messi,  Kaká,  Steven GerardDavid Beckham and Michael Ballack). 
2010 was the most successful year
in adidas Football history with all-time
record sales exceeding € 15 billion. 

The undisputable highlight was the 2010
FIFA World Cup where adidas sponsored
the winning team Spain,  and the adiZero
F50 was the top-scoring boot of the
event.

Basketball: increasing global footprint
adidas is committed to strengthening
its position in basketball by expanding
its footprint in the critical North
American market and capitalising on
the growing popularity of the sport in
the emerging markets.  To achieve thisadidas Basketball strives to build brand
equity by leveraging its status as the
official NBA outfitter,  capitalising on
relationships with some of the most
promising stars of the NBA such as
Derrick Rose and Dwight Howard,  and
building the best product in the game. 
In the current season,  adidas
Basketball is focusing in particular on the
'faster" franchise.  With the introduction
of the NBA Revolution 30 Uniforms,  the
lightest we have ever made,  and the
adiZero Rose shoe,  adidas has positioned
itself as the basketball brand that makes
the lightest products in the game. 

In 2011,  the NBA All-Star Game in
Los Angeles will be a key platform to
showcase the latest innovative technology
stories. 

Running: building credibility with
high-performance athletes
Running continues to be high on adidas'
agenda and is crucial to the brand's
success moving forward.  adidas'
philosophy is to inspire and enable
runners on all levels,  with the aim to be
the most trusted and desired runners'
brand in the world.  In recent yearsthe brand's focus has been on building
credibility with the high-performance
athlete and high-frequency fitness
runner.  This credibility now provides a
strong foundation to leverage broader
opportunities in running communities
worldwide.

Training: creating new
consumer experiences
At adidas,  training is the biggest
category for both men and women. 
Training supports the preparation needs
of serious athletes across all sports
disciplines and is the industry's largest
apparel category.  Its positioning is driven
by adidas' desire to support athletes
to be 'fit to win".  To achieve this goaladidas Training develops proprietary
technologies and commercialises
innovations for sport-specific categories
to meet the needs of the everyday athlete.

For example,  in 2010,  adidas Training
continued to expand athlete usage of
its industry-leading Techfit PowerWeb
concept,  expanding the offering into other
sports categories (e.g.  Women's). 
adidas sees significant market share
opportunities among casual runners and
young multi-sport runners in the future. 
To achieve growth and market share
increases in this category in 2011,  adidas
Running will promote younger multisport running products allowing runners
to be faster and cooler through the
adiZero and Climacool ranges. 

 key strategic priority for future
growth in the training category is
adidas' dedication to complement its
best-in-class product offering with
revolutionary new consumer experiences
that bring to life the adidas vision to be
the leading personalised brand in the
world.  Throughout 2010,  adidas Training
intensified its activity with athletes and
the world's leading authorities on athlete
performance,  subsequently launching
its first true 360° concept adidas Core
Performance.  This is a total training
range designed to help athletes make
the most of their workouts.  Through
 digital training website,  adidas Core
Performance interacts with consumersproviding exercise guidelines and advice
on four key training pillars: mindsetnutrition,  movement and recovery. 
In 2011,  adidas Training will
continue to put focus on its performance

business models such as Never-outof-stock and other managed space
initiatives  see Global Sales Strategyp.  82.  Further focus will also be put on
improving quality,  increasing colour
offerings and strengthening in-store

Outdoor: the athletic brand
in the outdoors
adidas has a long history in outdoorgoing back as far as 1978,  when adidas
and Reinhold Messner developed a new
generation of boots which he used to
reach base camp on his way to becoming
the first man to climb Mount Everest
without the help of oxygen equipment. 
With this heritage and the growth in
the outdoor sports sector,  adidas has
invested in building an authentic and
performance-orientated outdoor market
position,  through product collections
such as Terrex and Super Trekking. 
As well as footwear,  adidas also
offers a holistic product range from head
to toe comprising apparel,  backpacks and
eyewear including the latest adidas technologies and renowned partner technologies such as Gore-Tex,  Windstopper and
Nano-Tex.

tool to drive market share growth.

adidas Originals celebrating originality
The market for streetwear and lifestyle
fashion represents a unique opportunity
for sporting goods companies as it is
more fragmented and larger in size than
the market for products used in sports
activity.  In addition,  profitability in the
sports lifestyle market is typically higher
as a result of lower product complexity. 
adidas was the first brand to credibly
leverage its sports assets in the lifestyle
arena and as a result is regarded as a
legitimate sports lifestyle brand.  adidas
Originals with its Trefoil logo has become
 relevant part of many people's liveswhether they are skaters,  rockersartists,  musicians,  sneakerheads,  sports
fans,  etc.

With a holistic offering in products and
communications,  adidas Originals is
focusing on 16- to 24-year-old high
school and college kids. 

To address the needs of its diverse
consumer groups and maximise business
opportunities,  adidas Originals takes a
three-tier strategy to brand and product
marketing:
–  irst,  the brand invests and innovates

in new concepts,  whether it's street
fashion collections,  such as those
designed by Jeremy Scott,  or entering
new market segments such as the
snowboard community in alliance
with one of the leading brands in this
segment,  Burton. 
–  econd,  this permanent creation of

newness and creating buzz around
the Originals brand then allows us to
broaden our messages and expand
into wider business segments such as
denim,  skate or our women's offensive
Sleek. 
–  hird,  we commercialise the sub-brand

to the widest audience with concepts
such as adicolor,  where the consumers
can find their most-loved footwear
and apparel silhouettes in a variety of
colours and materials,  and appealing
seasonal themes such as Star Wars
and Mega. 
To stay connected to its core teenage
consumers,  adidas Originals uses a
constant stream of digital content to
keep them interested 365 days a year.  On
digital media such as Facebook,  adidas
Originals meanwhile has over 7 million
fans.  This is an area where adidas
Originals is currently a leader in the
digital marketplace. 

adidas Sport Style style your life
What once started as a niche business
has developed into a significant
contributor to the Group's top-line
development.  To best tap the potential of
the sports fashion market,  adidas Sport
Style is targeting that market with a clear
multi-label strategy. 
Y-3: pioneering
The 'Y" stands for Yohji Yamamotothe '3" represents adidas' three
signature stripes and the '-'signifies

pioneering sportswear label that fuses
sport and avant-garde design.  Yohji
Yamamoto's signature design aesthetic
is combined with traditional Japanese

will see the opening of additional Y-3

USA,  Asia and Europe and it will expand
its business by launching the global
e-commerce site Y-3store, com. 

adidas SLVR: smart design
In February 2009,  adidas introduced the
adidas SLVR label to expand its presence
among mid-price-point consumers. 
adidas SLVR is the smart fashion
sportswear label within adidas Sport

 need in the market for sophisticatedclassic,  yet fresh and confident
sportswear that lasts longer than one

this need.

distribution,  we have taken a conservative
approach,  working on a pilot phase with
some leading department stores such as

over the past 12 months.  From the
second half of 2011,  we will broaden

From a gender split,  we are targeting
primarily the girls,  which should account
for two-thirds of the business over
time.  In further expanding the label,  a
vertical business model is considered
the most effective way to approach the
target group,  taking into account the
competitive environment and future
demands of successful fashion brands

on creating retail solutions consisting of

activities.  ZigTech not only created
outstanding buzz among consumers but
also saw strong sell-through success for
men,  women and kids at key accounts in
key markets including the USA,  Russia
and Korea. 

Based on elements of total fitness
(strength,  conditioning,  flexibility),  Reebok's
focus is on three holistic footwear and
apparel concepts: Toning,  ZigTechRealFlex. 
€ 1913 billion 
Reebok's ZigTech footwear utilises a
unique 'Zig-Zag" geometry that delivers
energy transfer back to a runner's
running stride.  Its unique sole propels
the runner forward and is designed to
help reduce muscle fatigue in shins. 
Reebok's strategy is to expand the
ZigTech platform across categories
in order to build ownership with this
iconic geometric shape.  For examplein October 2010,  the brand launched
ZigTech Basketball in conjunction with
Washington Wizards Rookie John Wallallowing Reebok to revive the basketball
category.  The brand also extended
ZigTech into Kids,  capturing this young
and influential consumer in a highly
relevant way.  The ZigTech girls and boys
launch in the fourth quarter of 2010 in
the USA was supported by an integrated
'ReeZig" marketing campaign. 
In spring 2011,  the next categoryspecific evolution of ZigTech for men
and women will follow with the launch of
ZigTech Nano,  a lower-profile version of
the original ZigTech.

Capitalising on the momentum generated
by ZigTech footwear,  Reebok takes the
energy of ZigTech from the feet up to the
body with the launch of ZigTech apparel
for both men and women in 2011.  ZigTech
apparel is made with special fibres called
Celliant. 

These fibres are made with a collection
of natural minerals that help to increase
oxygen levels in the skin. 
The ZigTech concept will be
supported by an integrated global
marketing campaign 'ReeZig More
Energy" in 2011.  The campaign features
key assets from Reebok's roster of
athletes including John Wall,  Lewis
Hamilton,  Alexander Ovechkin and
Peyton Manning.  It shows the athletes
in training action with a visual language
highlighting the unique zig-zag shape. 

Flexibility: introducing RealFlex
In 2011,  Reebok will introduce its third
pillar,  supporting flexibility and natural
movement.  RealFlex is engineered with
76 independent 'sensors" that help
promote the natural movement of your
feet.  These sensors are positioned to
flex and move throughout the stride
while providing protection under the
feet.  RealFlex provides Reebok with
 unique point of view in the fastgrowing lightweight running and training
category.  And just like ZigTech and
Toning,  RealFlex represents a distinctive
visual DNA as well as a highly relevantfunctional consumer proposition. 
Reebok also demonstrates its
commitment to this fitness and
training area through the creation of
innovative workout experiences such
as its partnership with Cirque du Soleil
and the roll-out of the Jukari training
programme.  In 2011,  Reebok will expand
its fitness footprint around the world
through an innovative,  back to basics
grassroots movement. 

Revive Classics
Reebok Classics leverages the fitness
attitude and roots of the brand into
the lifestyle segment.  Classics targets
consumers who want to be 'fit for the
street" and value trend-right products
that fit their mobile lifestyle.  In 2010,  the
foundation and strategic direction of the
Classics business was further definedwhich has laid the groundwork for
Reebok Classics to re-emerge in 2011. 
The key product concept in 2011 is
Reebok Lite.  This collection modernises
Reebok's Classics offering by combining
lightweight,  trend-right materials and
Reebok's proprietary technologies.

­ aylorMade-­ didas Golf

Strategy

­ aylorMade-­ didas Golf's aim is to be the

leading performance golf company in the
world in terms of sales and profitability. 
­
It combines three of golf's best-known
and respected brands: ­ aylorMadeT

­ didas Golf and Ashworth.  The segment's
primary strategic pillars are to continuously develop and commercialise the
most innovative,  technologically advanced
products while,  at the same time,  maintaining brand credibility through high
visibility on professional golf tours.  In
addition,  leveraging brand equity through
the creation and execution of new
marketing and retail initiatives as well
as improving global distribution are key
priorities for long-term growth. 

Capitalising on the strong market
positions of three well-established
brands

­ aylorMade-­ didas Golf implements a

multi-brand strategy comprised of three
well-defined golf brands under one roof. 

­ aylorMade is the market leader in the
metalwoods category,  is among the
leaders in irons,  and is steadily evolving
as a challenger in putters as well as
golf balls.  ­ didas Golf develops higha
performance footwear and apparel for
athletes who want to maximise their
physical potential in order to play the
game at the highest level.  Ashworth is
an authentic golf-inspired lifestyle brand
complementing adidas Golf's position. 
­
Combining ­ didas Golf and Ashwortha

­ aylorMade-­ didas Golf is a global

leader in golf apparel and number two
in footwear. 

Innovation and technology focus

­ aylorMade-­ didas Golf's core objective

is to create the best performance golf
products in the marketplace,  starting
with a clear commitment to innovation
and technology see Research and Development,  p.  110.  The segment therefore
strives to extend its leadership position
through innovation and cutting-edge
design,  introducing at least two major
product innovations or evolutions
every 12 to 18 months.  For examplein 2010 ­ aylorMade introduced its new

xFT wedges incorporating Exchangeable
Face Technology,  which allows the player
to replace the clubface in order to get
new,  high-spinning grooves while keeping
the same clubhead.  In addition,  the Corza
Ghost putters help players to simplify
aiming through their white-coloured
putterhead including three,  highly visible
crown lines and a circular hole through
the head.

Golfers of all levels are influenced by
what equipment the best professional
players in the world play with and wear. 
Hence,  ­ aylorMade-­ didas Golf's leaderT

ship and presence on the world's major
professional golf tours is imperative to
increasing brand exposure and traction
among consumers. 
To attract the most talented playersT
­ aylorMade-­ didas Golf offers a

comprehensive service to the world's
leading players.  For example,  the

­ aylorMade support fleet travels the PGA
and European Tours from event to eventeach with a fully staffed,  state-of-the-art
workshop for building and servicing
drivers,  fairway woods,  hybrids,  ironswedges and putters on the spot.  Todaythe ­ aylorMade-­ didas Golf Tour Staff

Natalie Gulbis,  as well as Martin Kaymera top-ranked German golfer,  who in
2010 not only won his first major,  the US
PGA Championship,  but also earned the

still in its infancy,  TaylorMade-adidas
Golf entered into a new agreement with
the China Golf Association,  which has
appointed ­ aylorMade-­ didas Golf as

a
the exclusive equipment supplier of the
national golf team. 

Marketing excellence as a
key success factor
Well-coordinated and consumer-relevant
marketing is paramount to attaining
sustainable market leadership.  To
achieve that,  TaylorMade-­ didas Golf
­

has combined product marketing,  brand
communication and retail marketing into
one fully integrated global marketing
team.  This team uses a variety of
marketing tools to achieve its objectives. 
Product launches are supported by
substantial PR and marketing campaignsinvolving key assets and best-in-class
customer support to drive sell-through of

In addition to traditional marketing
techniques,  ­ aylorMade-­ didas Golf

a
is also dedicated to exploring and
executing new and innovative ways to
promote products using social media
(Facebook and Twitter) and product
seeding initiatives like Project Burnerin which TaylorMade-adidas Golf gave
away Burner 6-irons,  and the Penta TP
free-sleeve programme. 

Another prime example of TaylorMade-­
­
adidas Golf's efforts to create unique
promotional events is the 'Unstoppable
 Tour",  which brought high-energy
demo events into eight major US cities in
order to increase consumer awareness
of the new Burner 20 irons.  This helped

­ aylorMade to become the number one
selling iron brand in the USA during
November and December.  In 2010T
­ aylorMade-­ didas Golf also launched

the second round of the 'Wear in the
World" golf adventure,  which involved
testing performance apparel in some
of the world's most extreme weather
conditions.  Destinations included golf
courses at the birthplace of golf,  in
St.  Andrews,  Scotland,  the sandy dunes
of Dubai and Mount Rokko in Japan. 
The programme,  which illustrates
how technologies such as ClimacoolClimalite and Climaproof can help
provide a competitive advantage in the
most extreme golf conditions,  attracted
widespread attention from consumers
and the media. 

Intelligent retail marketing
and distribution

­ aylorMade-­ didas Golf works with

retail partners who possess the skills to
effectively showcase the performance
advantages and modern design
credentials of TaylorMade,  adidas Golf
­
­
and Ashworth products.  Core channels
include green grass retailers,  off-course
golf specialty retailers and sporting
goods retail formats with golf-specific
departments.

Focusing on strategic accountsT
­ aylorMade-­ didas Golf strives to create

and make available state-of-the-art floor
displays that showcase products and
communicate key messages as clearly
as possible,  allowing it to position its
clubs,  balls,  footwear and apparel among
the top-selling golf products in these
retail channels.  Close working relationships with key accounts will continue in
2011,  as will efforts to build additional
brand presence at smaller retailers
and on-course golf shops.  In emerging
markets throughout the world,  the
company employs established ­ didas

Group infrastructures to distribute
products,  promote awareness and drive
growth. 

Pricing strategy reflects
brand positioning

­ aylorMade-­ didas Golf's pricing policy

mirrors the positioning of its three
brands.  ­ aylorMade's pricing strategy

is to dominate the market at premium
price points and to compete aggressively
in the high-volume mid-price segment. 

­ didas Golf supports its market reputation as the innovation leader by selling
its products primarily at premium price
points.  Ashworth positions products in
the mid- and premium-price categories. 
Market share expansion,  particularly
in golf,  is driven mainly by the ability to
deliver best-in-class lines of products at
multiple price points.  In 2010,  an example
of ­ aylorMade-­ didas Golf's success in

a
implementing this strategy is the adiPure
(high-priced) footwear and Traxion Lite
(medium-priced) footwear.

­ aylorMade: extending leadership
in metalwoods and irons

­ aylorMade's category priorities include
strengthening its position as the number
one metalwood brand in the world and
building on its growing global market
share in irons.  In addition,  ­ aylorMade

aims to grow its presence and increase
its reputation in all other golf equipment
categories including wedges,  putters and
balls. 
– Metalwoods: Today,  TaylorMade is
­
the clear market leader in metalwoods
(drivers,  fairway woods and hybrids). 
The brand is particularly strong in the
USA,  where it has forged a more than
30% share of the market and a large
lead over its closest competitor.  The
brand's primary focus going forward
is to remain the innovation leader and
expand its metalwood business outside
the USA.  This will in part be driven by
strengthening its promotion partnerships
in other regions. 
TaylorMade
R11 driver 

The R11 clubs not only incorporate major

­ aylorMade driver technologies such as
Movable Weight Technology and Flight
Control Technology,  but also the new
Adjustable Sole Plate Technology,  which
allows the golfer to adjust the face angle
independently of the loft. 
TaylorMade
Burner SuperFast 20 driver 

see p.  68

At 279 grams,  the Burner SuperFast 20
is the lightest ­ aylorMade driver ever

brought to market and in combination
with its slippery new head aerodynamics
it promotes more clubhead speed and
distance than any previous Burner driver. 

see p.  67

− Irons: In irons,  the Burner irons family
has helped TaylorMade to gain consid­
erable market share in the category.  As
opposed to previous TaylorMade irons­
the Burner long-irons,  middle-irons and
short-irons were developed separately
rather than as an entire group.  The introduction of the Burner 20 in the fourth
quarter of 2010 and the launch of Tour
Preferred irons in March 2011 will play
 key role in driving future growth in the
category. 

− Putters: ­ aylorMade's Corza Ghost

putter stood out in 2010 both with
consumers as well as with Tour professionals.  Its white-coloured putterhead
makes it easier to aim and eliminates
glare on the crown.  Furthermore,  viewers
could immediately recognise its unique
design when it helped Justin Rose win
twice on the PGA Tour.  In 2011,  there
will be new additions to the Ghost line
that incorporate the input of a variety of
Tour pros. 

− Wedges: Leveraging TaylorMade's
­
success in metalwoods and irons to other
categories such as wedges continues
to be a strategic priority.  Innovation
is critical in this respect and,  in 2010the success of the TP wedge with
Exchangeable Face Technology (xFT)
validated TaylorMade's aim to increase
­
its presence and grow its share in other
golf equipment categories.  xFT permits
players to easily replace a worn clubface
with a new one,  making it possible to
maintain a fresh,  spin-inducing clubface
without replacing the clubhead.  For the
consumer,  this is more cost-effective
than buying a new wedge. 

− Golf balls: Success in this category
depends on the ability to create highperformance golf balls,  bring them to
market and build credibility among Tour
professionals.  In 2010,  ­ aylorMade's

status as a maker of premium golf balls
was enhanced through the Penta TP ballthe first five-layer golf ball,  designed to
promote optimal performance on the
five critical golf shots driver,  longiron,  middle-iron,  short-iron and partial
wedges.  The technological advantage
of the Penta TP was highlighted by 18
wins on the world's major tours in 2010including the PGA Championship.  In 2011T
­ aylorMade will continue to build on its
momentum in golf balls,  driven by the
Penta TP ball,  and increasing the number
of Tour professionals using ­ aylorMade

balls such as Jim Furyk,  the 2010 PGA
Tour Player of the Year. 

From a product perspective,  the brand
will complement its successful R9
franchise and Burner family of metalwoods with the introduction of the new
R11 series of drivers and the Burner
SuperFast 20 in 2011.

In footwear,  leveraging proprietary technologies from various other ­ didas

c
­ ategories such as adiPrene+ with golfspecific technologies offers a significant
competitive advantage over 'pure play"
golf footwear brands. 

In 2010,  ­ didas Golf was able to bring

significant new innovation to market
including the adiPure Z with revolutionary
ThinTech low-profile technology,  bringing
the golfer closer to the ground for
improved stability,  better overall footwork
and more consistent ball-striking. 
In apparel,  ­ didas Golf positions

itself as the most innovative
performance brand in the game by
utilising ­ didas technologies such as

Formotion,  Climacool and Climaproof
technologies in adidas Golf apparel
­
products.  adidas Golf was the first major
­
brand to incorporate technologies like
these into golf apparel.  For examplein 2010 ­ didas Golf launched the new

Climacool with Coolmax Energy fabric
apparel line,  which is designed to
improve airflow to the skin by utilising
microfibres. 
In 2011,  several new product
launches such as the next generation
of the Tour360 footwear franchise,  the
Tour360 50,  which is engineered to be
lighter,  lower and more stable than its
predecessor,  will continue ­ didas Golf's

authentic union of design,  technology
and function.  In addition,  in 2011,  adidas
­
Golf will leverage its marketing efforts
for both its footwear and apparel lines
with one campaign 'Be Greater". 
This campaign will call the golfers'
attention to how adidas Golf equipment
­
is engineered to help them improve their
performance,  exceed their potential and
reach a higher level. 

Ashworth: an authentic golf
lifestyle brand
Ashworth provides TaylorMade-­ didas
­

Golf with a unique opportunity to
establish a golf lifestyle business. 
Founded in 1987,  Ashworth's roots in golf
and authenticity as a golf brand provide a
key differentiator from other golf lifestyle
brands.  Following the acquisition in 2008the brand was given a facelift,  including
definition of product range architecturecleaning-up of distribution and revamping
its partnership portfolio,  thus creating a
platform for future profitable growth.  In
2010,  Ashworth introduced new product
lines incorporating proprietary fabrics
for easy care and superior wear.  The
key priority for 2011 will be to further
strengthen the messaging of Ashworth's
positioning as a golf lifestyle brand for
true golfers that believe 'the course
never leaves you,  and you never leave the
course".  Ashworth will also seek to build
Tour visibility and credibility utilising Tour
professionals Fred Couples,  Sean O'Hair
and Ryan Palmer.

Reebok-CCM Hockey has the strongest
league partnerships within the industry. 
It is the exclusive licensee of jerseys
for the National Hockey League (NHL)the American Hockey League (AHL)the Canadian Hockey League (CHL) and
many of the European National (8) and

supplier of the AHL,  the CHL and
the ECHL.  100% of all NHL players
wear the ­ eebok Edge uniform which

consists of the 30 teams' home,  away
and third game jerseys and socks. 
− ­
Reebok-CCM Hockey has formed
endorsement partnerships with many
of the best athletes in the world.  With
manufacturing capabilities close to the
world's major leagues,  the two brands
can respond rapidly with customised
solutions.  This provides a strong
competitive advantage in attracting key
pro athletes.  The ­ eebok Hockey brand

is currently endorsed by NHL players
such as Sidney Crosby,  Pavel DatsyukPatrice Bergeron,  Roberto Luongo
and Marc-Andre Fleury.  CCM Hockey's
roster of player endorsees includes
Alexander Ovechkin,  Joe ThorntonVincent Lecavalier and John Tavares. 

Key strategic categories to drive growth

­ eebok-CCM Hockey intends to accomplish growth through a continuous
stream of product launches in its three
key category priorities: skates,  sticks and
apparel. 

− Skates: The focus in the skate
category is to drive market share
increases through products addressing
critical aspects such as fit,  weight and
durability.  For example,  in 2010,  a new
line of Reebok Hockey skates,  led by
­
the 11K Pump,  was launched featuring
an advanced fit element and was also
designed with a focus on lightweight and
durable materials.  In the fourth quarter
of 2010,  CCM Hockey launched the next
generation of its U+ platform which
features the CCM U+ Crazy Light skatethe brand's most thermo-formable and
customisable skate to date.  The rest of
the line will be delivered to the market by
April of 2011.

− Sticks: To drive future growth in the
sticks category,  Reebok-CCM Hockey
­
focuses on developing new technologies
that incorporate enhanced power,  feelflexibility and weight.  Launched in the
fourth quarter of 2010,  Reebok Hockey's
­
11K Sickick III stick features Dual Matrix
and Guided Blade Technologies that
are engineered to provide players with
 quicker release and improved puck
control. 

In 2011,  CCM will embark on a global
launch of its new CCM U+ Crazy Light
stick,  the lightest performance stick in
the marketplace,  along with the launch
of the U+ Crazy Strong stick,  a highperformance stick engineered to offer
greater durability.

− Apparel: ­ eebok-CCM Hockey will

strive to further leverage its league partnerships and exclusive uniform status
to drive growth.  The Reebok Edge NHL
­

­ ersey features a four-way Stretch Mesh
to provide players with maximum ventilation and range of motion.  In addition to
official uniforms,  Reebok-CCM Hockey
­
will take advantage of its status as the
official NHL locker room performance
apparel supplier,  and its exclusive rights
related to the NHL Players' Association (NHLPA) for name and numbered
apparel and headwear.  NHL locker room
performance apparel relates to the
apparel that pro athletes wear under
their jerseys during a game,  or to work
out and train in the gym. 

 key product initiative in this area is

­ eebok Speedwick apparel.  Designed
to feel like cotton,  fabrics used in this
apparel are breathable and inhibit the
growth of bacteria by utilising anti­
microbial yarns.  Furthermore,  in 2011R
­ eebok Hockey will introduce ZigTech
technology in hockey-related performance and training apparel.  ZigTech
apparel is engineered with Celliant
fibres that according to laboratory tests
cause more oxygen in the skin exposed
to the apparel than a regular polyester
garment.  This allows players to optimise
their energy recovery during off-ice
workouts and during games. 

Increase profitability through supply
chain efficiencies
Another strategic priority for

­ eebok-CCM Hockey is to continue to
pursue a movement away from own
manufacturing to sourcing goods. 
However,  manufacturing activities will be
maintained in areas where it is a distinct
competitive advantage to do so,  such as
is the case for performance products
destined for pro level athletes. 
Pricing strategy mirrors product
positioning

­ eebok-CCM Hockey's pricing strategy
is consistent with its positioning as a
high-performance company.  Through
 commitment to product innovationR
­ eebok-CCM Hockey's pricing strategy is
to dominate the market in the premium
price segments and to be a strong
competitor within the mid-price segment
of the market.

Global Operations
The adidas Group's Global Operations function manages the development,  production planning,  sourcing and distribution of the
majority of our products.  The function continually strives to both increase efficiency throughout the Group's supply chain and to
ensure the highest standards in product quality and delivery performance for our customers at competitive costs. 
Enforced vision: closest to
every consumer
The vision of the Global Operations
function is to be closest to every
consumer.  By delivering on each of its
five strategic pillars  see   02,  Global
Operations strives to provide the right
product to consumers in the right sizecolour and style,  in the right place,  at
the right time,  across the entire range
of the Group's channels and brands. 
Global Operations has a strong track
record for establishing state-of-the-art
infrastructure,  processes and systems. 
Over the last four years,  the function has
successfully consolidated and improved
legacy structures,  reducing complexity
and operating cost for the Group.  By
taking strong ownership for quality,  cost
and availability,  we have proven that we
are able to respond to the fast-changing
requirements of both our consumers and
customers. 
The Route 2015 strategic business
plan will require changes in how
Global Operations operates within the
Group.  Global Operations has therefore
formulated its strategic plan in close
alignment with the needs of our Global
Brands and Global Sales functions and
in consideration of several external
factors impacting the business today. 
These include anticipated increases
in commodity prices,  labour and
transportation costs,  social and
regulatory requirements and demand
growth as well as increasing demand
volatility. 

Throughout the next five years,  Global
Operations will focus on five strategic
priorities supported by 15 initiatives for
the Group:
– Ensuring cost competitiveness
– Providing industry-leading availability
– Enabling later ordering
– Supporting the Group's growth projects
– Modernising the Group's infrastructure.

  Group Management Report Our Group 

By delivering on these initiatives,  the
function will not only enable the Group
to achieve its Route 2015 goals,  but will
also ensure our supply chain remains a
competitive advantage in making us the
partner of choice for both consumers
and customers. 
The first two priorities in Global
Operations' 2015 strategic plan ensure
the function continues to deliver upon
the Group's basic requirements.  The
remaining three priorities are aimed at
positioning Global Operations ahead of
industry competition.

Processes and infrastructure of the future 
Ensuring cost competitiveness: As
part of this priority,  Global Operations
will focus on further optimising
product creation through a more
efficient material and colour selection
process.  This,  coupled with increased
automation in manufacturing,  will
enhance productivity,  shorten lead
times and improve overall quality.  These
improvements are expected to enhance
profitability for the Group and ensure
we provide our consumers with the best
value proposition in the industry. 
The Profitability Management
department within Global Operations
assumes a central role in realising cost
competitiveness by driving our strategic
costing efforts and optimising our buying
strategies.  This includes monitoring
macroeconomic trends,  to identify the
future impact on product costs as well as
the ongoing financial assessment of the
adidas Group's supply base. 
Providing industry-leading availability:
Building on the solid platform that has
been established to ensure product availability,  Global Operations will further
shorten our order-to-delivery lead times. 
This will be accomplished by establishing and offering a set of tailored and
sophisticated replenishment models to
our customers via improvements in our
planning systems and processes.  The
development of risk-oriented planning
and production models for selected
product ranges as well as the shift from
buying to inventory planning at our distribution centres both form key requirements for the successful delivery of this
initiative. 

Enabling later ordering: Enabling later
ordering is a cross-functional priority in
Global Operations focused on allowing
our customers to order our products
closer to the time of sale,  facilitating
buying decisions that are based on better
market knowledge. 
This will support our Route 2015
goal of reducing the lead times across
the Group's product portfolio to 60 days
or less.  Specifically,  the initiative will
focus on immediately reducing production lead times on the majority of Reebok
footwear from 90 days to 60 days.  Since
the majority of adidas footwear is already
on 60 days,  the change will allow us to
align sales processes across the brands
and improve efficiencies.  Preparations
are also underway to bring apparel lead
times down to 60 days or less over time. 
The above improvements involve
establishing a greater regional source
base for apparel,  which will enable us to
manufacture closer to our key markets to
deliver and replenish products faster. 
Supporting the Group's growth projects:
Global Operations will support the growth
projects outlined in the Group's Route
2015 plan,  such as the adidas NEO labelkey market programmes,  Retail and
eCommerce as well as other key brand
programmes such as customisation
see Global Brands Strategy,  p.  87 and Global Sales
Strategy,  p.  82. 

For example,  with the adidas NEO
label,  Global Operations will support
this business with fast fashion creationsourcing and supply chain management
capabilities.  For Retail,  Global Operations
will continue to build the processes and
systems backbone with the ultimate goal
being a demand-driven supply chain
that leverages existing short lead time
production models to improve availability
without excessive inventory see Retail
Strategy,  p.  84. 
Finally,  Global Operations will focus
on evolving existing customisation
models in support of business expansionparticularly within our eCommerce
channel.

Modernising the Group's infrastructure:
Global Operations will continue to focus
on building the required infrastructureprocesses and systems to support the
Group's growth plans.  This will include
further process simplification,  consolidation of legacy systems and distribution structures,  as well as the creation
of state-of-the-art systems required
to support new business demands.  An
example of this is the opening of our
new Spartanburg distribution campus
designed to support growth in the USA. 
Also under this priority,  the function
will continue delivering its existing
long-term improvement programmes
such as Fast and Lean Creation for
apparel,  the roll-out of the Global
Procurement Solution platform and the
expansion of virtualisation to new product
categories and the design teams.

Several major programmes reach
important milestones in 2010
Throughout 2010,  Global Operations
made significant progress on key
projects.  In May,  we saw the formal
opening of the Group's Spartanburg
distribution facility in South CarolinaUSA.  With this state-of-the-art facilitywe are now servicing our wholesale
customers as well as our own-retail and
e-commerce activities in the USA across
the brands adidas,  Reebok,  TaylorMadeadidas Golf and Rockport with 80% of
our customers receiving their orders in
three days or less.  We also successfully
completed several important system
simplification projects.  The Reebok and
Ashworth brands were integrated into the
long-term roll-out of the adidas Group's
Global Procurement Solution (GPS). 
adidas,  Reebok and Ashworth purchase
orders are now procured through one
common platform covering the entire
flow from market demand,  factory
planning through to supplier invoice
procurement and subsidiary billing.  In
total,  the GPS 20 release replaced five
major IT applications.  We also reduced
the total number of supply planning
systems across the adidas Group from
three to one,  establishing a common
planning,  reporting and communication
platform.  Another major achievement
in 2010 was the official implementation
of the Fast and Lean Creation process
for footwear.  Product creation teams
are now developing around 75% of all
footwear directly with factories,  laying the
foundation for the introduction of creation
calendars of 12 months or less. 

Majority of production through
independent suppliers
To minimise production costs,  we
outsource over 95% of production to
independent third-party suppliersprimarily located in Asia.  While we
provide them with detailed specifications
for production and delivery,  these
suppliers possess excellent expertise in
cost-efficient,  high-volume production of
footwear,  apparel and accessories.  The
latest list of our supplier factories can be
found on our website www, adidas-Group. 
com/en/sustainability/suppliersandworkers. 
The adidas Group also operates a
limited amount of own production and
assembly sites in Germany (1),  Sweden
(1),  Finland (1),  the USA (4),  Canada
(4),  China (1) and Japan (1).  In order to
ensure the high quality consumers expect
from our products,  we enforce strict
control and inspection procedures at our
suppliers and in our own factories.  In
addition,  we promote adherence to social
and environmental standards throughout
our supply chain see Sustainability,  p.  120. 

108 

  Global Operations 
  Group Management Report Our Group 

Fast and Lean Creation for apparel
also reached a major milestone with
the launch of a new product lifecycle
management system,  FlexPLM,  within
just eight months of the project launch. 
Also in 2010,  Global Operations teams
contributed to both the Group's Virtualisation programme by creating over
18000 articles as 3D files,  and to the
'Fit & Size" programme which involved
the adjustment of over 500 base patterns
to current consumers' body shapes for
an improved overall fit of garments. 

Overall number of manufacturing
partners stable
In 2010,  Global Operations worked with
270 independent manufacturing partners. 
While the number of suppliers in apparel
decreased as a result of further rationalisation of the supply base,  it increased in
footwear and hardware.  The increase in
footwear was the result of the significant
growth in volumes and expansion into
new sourcing countries (e.g.  Cambodia). 
Of our independent manufacturing
partners,  75% were located in Asia,  16%
were located in the Americas and 9% in
Europe  see   03.  32% of all suppliers
were located in China. 
Our Global Operations function
manages product developmentcommercialisation and distributionand also supervises sourcing for our
Wholesale and Retail segments as well
as for adidas Golf  see   01.  Due to the
specific sourcing requirements in their
respective fields of business,  TaylorMadeRockport,  Reebok-CCM Hockey and the
Sports Licensed Division are not serviced
through Global Operations,  but instead
utilise their own purchasing organisation. 
In order to quickly seize short-term
opportunities in their local market
or react to trade regulations,  Group
subsidiaries may,  with the approval of
our Social and Environmental team,  also
source from selected local suppliers
outside the realm of Global Operations. 
Local purchases,  however,  account only
for a minor portion of the Group's total
sourcing volume.

China's share of footwear
production decreases
97% of our total 2010 footwear volume
for adidas,  Reebok and adidas Golf was
produced in Asia (2009: 97%).  Production
in Europe and the Americas combined
accounted for 3% of the sourcing
volume (2009: 3%)  see   04.  China
represents our largest sourcing country
with approximately 39% of the total
volume,  followed by Vietnam with 31%
and Indonesia with 22%.  As part of our
strategy to increase the regional diversity
of our supplier base to meet the ongoing
needs of our business,  the overall
representation of China in our sourcing
mix declined 2 percentage points.  At
the same time,  the footwear volumes
sourced from Cambodia almost tripled
in 2010 from a low comparison base.  In
2010,  our footwear suppliers produced
approximately 219 million pairs of shoes
(2009: approx.  171 million pairs)  see 
 05.  The year-over-year increase was
driven by the strong sales growth in 2010
and a low comparison base in 2009 due to
inventory clean-up activities.  Our largest
footwear factory produced approximately
9% of the footwear sourcing volume
(2009: 11%).  Rockport purchased
approximately 8 million pairs of footwear
in 2010,  which represents an increase of
27% versus the prior year.  Products were
primarily sourced from factories in China
(67%),  Vietnam (25%),  Indonesia (5%) and
India (3%).  The largest factory accounted
for 37% of the total sourcing volume of
the Rockport brand. 

Volume of apparel production increases
In 2010,  we sourced 82% of the total
apparel volume for adidas,  Reebok
and adidas Golf from Asia (2009: 83%). 
Europe remained the second-largest
apparel sourcing region,  representing
12% of the volume (2009: 11%).  The
Americas accounted for 6% of the volume
(2009: 6%)  see   06.  China was the
largest source country,  representing
36% of the produced volume,  followed
by Thailand with 13% and Indonesia with
13%.  In total,  our suppliers produced
approximately 301 million units of
apparel in 2010 (2009: approx.  239 million
units)  see   07.  The largest apparel
factory produced approximately 9%
of this apparel volume in 2010 (2009:
11%).  In addition,  Reebok-CCM Hockey
sourced around 2 million units of apparel
in 2010 (2009: approx.  2 million units). 
The majority of this volume was also
produced in Asia,  while small portions
were sourced from the Americas
(particularly Canada) and Europe. 
The Sports Licensed Division sourced
approximately 23 million units of apparel
and 15 million units of headwear (2009:
20 million and 14 million,  respectively). 
The majority of purchased apparel
products was sourced as unfinished
goods from Latin America (85%) and Asia
(15%),  and was subsequently finished in
our own screen-printing facilities in the
USA.  The majority of headwear sourced
was finished products manufactured
predominately in Asia (97%) and the
USA (3%). 

67% of adidas and Reebok branded
hardware produced in China
In 2010,  the bulk (i, e.  98%) of adidas and
Reebok branded hardware products,  such
as balls and bags,  was also produced in
Asia (2009: 98%).  China remained our
largest source country,  accounting for
67% of the sourced volume,  followed
by Vietnam with 20% and Pakistan with
11%.  The remaining 2% was sourced via
European countries  see   08.  The total
2010 hardware sourcing volume was
approximately 48 million units (2009:
approximately 34 million units),  with the
largest factory accounting for 21% of
production  see   09. 
TaylorMade and Reebok-CCM Hockey
sourced 98% and 72% of their hardware
volumes from Asia,  respectively (2009:
92% and 78%).  In addition,  both brands
sourced a portion of hardware products
in the Americas.  At TaylorMade,  the
majority of golf club components were
manufactured by suppliers in China and
assembled by TaylorMade in the USAChina and Japan.

Research and Development
Creating innovative products to meet the changing needs of athletes and consumers is essential to drive brand perception.  As
 result,  research and development (R&D) is a cornerstone for the success of our business.  We invest considerable resources
into developing and commercialising new technologies as well as fresh design ideas,  in order to best fulfil the unique
needs of our consumers.  The research and development process is driven by teams of employees with diverse professional
backgrounds.  In 2011,  R&D will focus on customisation and digital sports products. 

R&D an integral part of the product
creation process
R&D within the adidas Group follows a
decentralised approach.  Fundamental
and biomechanical research,  howeveris shared across the Group.  In line
with its distinctive positioning,  each
brand runs its own research,  design
and development activities.  The teams
generally have either a category or a
technology focus.  R&D is not a separate
organisational entity,  but is closely
integrated with the sourcing,  design
and product marketing functions.  As a
result,  all R&D activities are focused on
producing results directly applicable to
 specific product.  At the beginning of
the product creation process,  marketing
defines a development priority.  This is
derived on a case-by-case basis from
 combination of consumer research
and feedback,  competition analysis and
own product testing.  Independently
from specific development requestsour innovation teams also analyse new
materials,  production processes or
scientific research often even from
other industries to increase the scope
of idea generation.  These are presented
to product marketing at an early stage to
assess commerciality. 

110 

  Group Management Report Our Group 

Once conceptualised,  new technologies
are engineered using state-of-the-art
CAD and Finite Element Analysis (FEA)
systems.  The sourcing team together
with the material teams within product
development work closely with our
suppliers to identify innovative materials
as well as integrate cost and production
process aspects into the development
phase.  As soon as a new technology
is deemed viable,  it is produced as a
physical sample.  Samples are then tested
extensively by members of our innovation
team as well as by top athletes.  Only
when these tests have been successful
are technologies handed over to product
marketing which commercialises the
technology to a final product. 

adidas Innovation Team drives
brand's R&D initiatives
R&D activities at adidas focus on the
development of innovative technologies
­
for performance sport.  To solidify adidas'
position as a leader in technology and
innovation,  the adidas Innovation Team
(ait) is responsible for the ongoing
development of new technologies and
concepts in all key product categories. 

  Research and Development 
The team is divided into groups that
focus on apparel,  footwear and hardwarewithin which there are individual product
focus categories like basketball,  football
(soccer),  American football or crosscategory project areas such as intelligent
products or energy management
systems (cushioning technologies).  The
majority of these teams are located
in Herzogenaurach,  Germany,  and
Portland/Oregon,  USA.  Dedicated
innovation develop­ ent centres in Asia

focus on the realisation of concepts
through prototyping as part of the
product creation process.  These centres
are important in terms of development
efficiencies,  as product development
takes place in real production
environments. 

R&D activities at Reebok focus
on fitness and training
R&D teams at Reebok create footwearapparel and hardware with the primary
focus being on fitness and training. 
Teams are structured along the brand's
category priorities,  in strength and
muscle activation,  conditioning and
flexibility.  In addition,  there are certain
cross-category groups such as the
Reebok Advanced Concepts (RAC) teamwhich ensures specific concepts can be
taken right through from initial idea to
production. 

Reebok's R&D activities are primarily
located in Canton/Massachusetts,  USAwith collaboration partners at Advanced
Development Centres in China and
Vietnam,  which focus on new technology
developments,  cutting-edge materials
and treatments and manufacturing
solutions. 

Industry-leading R&D at
TaylorMade-adidas Golf
TaylorMade-adidas Golf's R&D team is
focused on continually designing and
developing industry-leading products. 
The team is structured according to the
different product categories in golf and is
located in Carlsbad/California,  USA. 
Vertically integrated R&D
activities at Rockport
Rockport's R&D function,  located
in Canton/Massachusetts,  USA,  is
 vertically integrated organisation
that covers all aspects of strategyresearch,  design,  engineering and
testing,  while incorporating the Group's
advanced proprietary athletic footwear
technologies into the shoe collections. 

Reebok-CCM Hockey R&D
located in Canada
The R&D team at Reebok-CCM Hockeylocated in Montreal/Quebec,  Canada,  is
dedicated to continuously creating stateof-the-art hockey equipment for both
professional and recreational players. 
Teams are organised by category under
the two brands Reebok and CCM. 
Selective purchase of external
R&D expertise
In addition to its internal R&D efforts,  the
adidas Group also purchases a limited
amount of R&D expertise from wellestablished research partners.  This
strategy allows for greater flexibility
and faster access to know-how that
may otherwise require considerable
time and resources if built up within
the Group.  To increase efficiency and
protect research results,  collaborations
are usually long-term and exclusive. 
All projects carried out with external
partners are based on a clearly
defined mandate outlining the project
scope to ensure consistency with
the Group's R&D focus.  Major adidas
relationships exist with the University of
Loughborough,  England,  the University
of Calgary,  Canada,  the University of
Erlangen-Nuremberg and the University
of Freiburg,  Germany.  For examplethe ultra-lightweight adidas adiZero
F50 football boot's traction studies
were carried out in conjunction with the
University of Freiburg,  Germany. 

Also in 2010,  there were further Techfit
apparel technology developmentsin association with the University of
Calgary,  Canada.  For its 2010 productReebok continued its research with
R&D institutes around the world,  which
included electromyographic research at
Utica College,  USA,  and the University of
Erlangen-Nuremberg,  Germany.  On the
ZigTech platform,  Reebok also carried
out under-foot pressure assessment
research in association with the
University of Wisconsin,  USA.  In 2010TaylorMade-adidas Golf continued its
long-term cooperation with researchers
at the University of Calgary,  Canadawith extensive joint swing dynamic
studies,  identifying the influence of shaft
variations on player performance and
perception. 

Active trademark and patent
protection policy
To capitalise on the Group's R&D
achievements,  we seek patent protection
for our innovations.  It is an important
business policy for our Group to secure
the best available patent protection for
our innovations.  As we use a wide range
of different technologies in our productswe are not dependent upon any single
technology,  or any patent rights related
to any single technology.  We also own
 substantial portfolio of registered
trademarks for the Group's brands and
related proprietary names. 

As part of our business policy,  we
enforce the Group's trademarks and
patents by monitoring the marketplace
for infringements and taking action to
prevent them.  This includes a vigorous
anti-counterfeiting programme.  We also
have comprehensive processes,  and
undertake significant research,  to avoid
infringement of third party intellectual
property rights  see Risk and Opportunity
Report,  p.  158. 

Major R&D locations and activities 
Highly skilled technical personnel
Our R&D departments comprise
experienced and skilled people from
different areas of technical expertise and
also from diverse cultural backgrounds. 
Mechanical,  biomechanical and
engineering specialists focus primarily
on the development of performance
footwear,  concentrating on reducing
stress on knees and other joints.  Experts
in material engineering concentrate
on the development of apparel and
footwear with an emphasis on increasing
durability and flexibility as well as
enhancing temperature and moisture
management.  Process and production
specialists also form an essential part
of our product development strength. 
Other professional backgrounds include
software development,  industrial and
graphic design,  electronic engineeringFinite Element Analysis,  advanced CAD
design and kinesiology.  In 2011,  we
expect the number of R&D employees to
increase slightly.  The number of people
employed in the Group's R&D activities at
December 31,  2010 was 1002,  compared
to 999 employees in the prior year.  This
represents 2% of total Group employeesa slight decrease compared to the prior
year (2009: 3%).

Initiatives to further streamline product
creation process
We aim at improving our ability to adapt
to changing consumer preferences more
quickly,  flexibly and efficiently.  We achieve
this by facilitating the direct interaction
and involvement of our suppliers in
product creation,  quality control,  product
testing and commercialisation.  In 2010we fully implemented our Fast and Lean
Creation programme for footwear and
started the programme for apparel  see
Global Operations,  p.  106.  In 2010,  we also
made further progress on integrating
marketing and design teams into the
product creation process at an earlier
stage.  This measure supports the
minimisation of costly product changes
in the later stages of the development
process. 
R&D expenses increase 18%
R&D expenses include expenses for
personnel and administration,  but
exclude other costs,  for example those
associated with the design aspect of
the product creation process.  In 2010as in prior years,  all R&D costs were
expensed as incurred.  adidas Group
R&D expenses increased by 18% to
€ 102 million (2009: € 86 million) as a
result of increases at adidas from initiatives relating to the development of intelligent products.  Personnel expenses
represent the largest portion of R&D
expenses,  accounting for more than 69%
of total R&D expenses in 2010.  In 2010R&D expenses represented 20% of total
operating expenses versus 20% in the
prior year.  R&D expenses as a percentage
of sales remained stable at 08% (2009:
08%)  see Note 2,  p.  189.

Successful commercialisation
of technological innovations
Developing industry-leading technologies
is only one aspect of being an innovation
leader.  This is supported by the awards
we attained in 2010,  which are further
proof of our technology leadership within
the sporting goods industry  see   06. 
Even more important is the successful
commercialisation of those technological
innovations.  Also in 2010,  the majority
of adidas Group sales were generated
with products newly introduced in the
course of the year.  New products tend to
have a higher gross margin compared to
products which have been in the market
for more than one season.  As a resultnewly launched products contributed
over-proportionately to the Group's
net income in 2010.  We expect this
development to continue in 2011 as our
launch schedule highlights a full pipeline
of innovative products  see Subsequent
Events and Outlook,  p.  174. 
Successful product launches across
all major adidas categories
In 2010,  adidas sales were again driven
by the latest product offerings,  with
products launched within the year
accounting for 75% of brand sales
(2009: 80%).  Only 2% of total sales were
generated with products introduced
three or more years ago (2009: 3%).  In
running,  an updated version of the ultralightweight running shoe adiZero adios
was launched in 2010.  Using advanced
composite materials and innovative
construction and design,  this shoe
enabled athletes to win over 60 major
race titles in 2010. 

  Research and Development 
In the football category,  the adidas
adiZero F50 was introduced at the 2010
FIFA World Cup.  The new SprintSkin
upper has been created using an
innovative single-layer microfibre
polyurethane (PU) synthetic material
to reduce the overall weight and to
ensure the shoe fits like a second skin. 
adidas also launched the Clima365
range in 2010,  demonstrating advanced
body temperature regulation technology
for apparel,  which uses BodyMapping
technology to define heat and sweat
zones in order to place fabrics directly
where they are needed the most.  adidas'
digital training system miCoach was
extended in 2010 with the introduction
of the miCoach pacer and the miCoach
app.  The miCoach pacer uses a digital
trainer in conjunction with sportsspecific training programmes to provide a
personal coach,  telling the athlete exactly
what to do and when.  The new miCoach
app extends adidas personal coaching
to smartphone platforms,  such as the
iPhone and the Blackberry.  This service
further broadens the training offering
and also introduces specific conditioning
programmes for football,  tennisAmerican football and basketball.

Reebok expands toning and introduces
ZigTech technology platform
In 2010,  Reebok's latest products
generated the majority of Reebok's
sales,  with an estimated 63% of footwear
sales coming from products launched in
2010 (2009: 64%).  Only 15% of footwear
product sales relate to products introduced three or more years ago (2009:
14%). 
Reebok expanded its toning offering
with the introduction of RunToneTrainTone and JumpTone.  Each toning
platform encourages muscle activation
in key leg muscles but is engineered for
specific sports (RunTone for runningTrainTone for training and JumpTone for
basketball).  The technological innovations
in these products also support growth into
the men's category,  as increased muscle
activation finds resonance with this
target consumer,  particularly in terms of
building strength.  In 2010,  toning products
were also introduced for apparel.  The
EasyTone apparel collection is designed to
tone and strengthen upper body muscles
and improve posture and body alignment. 
This innovative performance apparel
line uses ResisTone bands to create
resistance as the wearer moves.  Also
in 2010,  Reebok launched the ZigTech
technology platform,  which concentrates
on delivering improved efficiency to
athletes,  enabling them to run further and
reduce wear and tear in key leg muscles. 
The sole of the ZigTech shoe features
lightweight foam that is engineered into
 geometric,  zig-zag shape.  This unique
zig-shaped sole absorbs the impact of
heel strike and sends a wave of energy
along the length of the shoe,  propelling
the athlete forward with each step. 

Innovation a key success factor for
TaylorMade-adidas Golf
At TaylorMade-adidas Golf,  current
products (i, e.  products launched in the
last 18 months,  which is the typical
product lifecycle in golf) represented
58% of total hardware sales in 2010
(2009: 69%).  Products that had been
brought to market three or more
years ago accounted for 5% of sales in
2010 (2009:15%).  Among the highlight
product launches in 2010 was the R9
SuperTri driver,  which combines Movable
Weight Technology with Flight Control
Technology.  The R9 product family of
woods accounted for approximately 37%
of TaylorMade metalwoods sales in 2010. 
TaylorMade also launched the Burner
SuperFast driver in 2010.  This ultralightweight (<285g) and aerodynamically
engineered driver is designed to produce
maximum head speed.  The new Burner
20 irons,  introduced in 2010,  have
individually been further engineered
to improve distance,  accuracy and
playability.  The Burner 20 irons gained
substantial market share at the end of
2010 and played a key role in placing
TaylorMade as number one in irons
in terms of dollar sales in the USA in
November and December 2010. 

The TaylorMade Penta ball became
available in quantities worldwide in 2010
and represented 35% of TaylorMade's
golf ball sales in the US market in 2010. 
Finally,  the Corza Ghost putter,  the first
white putter,  became the number three
putter model sold in the USA in 2010 and
propelled market share in putters well
above 10%. 

Rockport extends truWalk architecture
Due to the different business model for
the Rockport brand as a leather shoe
company,  the impact from new styles
is significantly lower compared to our
other brands.  Products launched in
2010 accounted for an estimated 52%
of sales (2009: 55%).  In 2010,  R&D
efforts concentrated on making shoes
more walkable and this was achieved
by extending Rockport's innovative
truWalk architecture into dress,  casual
and rugged casual shoe products.  The
truWalk architecture works with the
foot's natural motion,  resulting in a more
comfortable,  energised stride.  Using
adiPrene technology by adidas,  truWalk
enables a soft heel-strike,  transitioning
to a smooth roll through the arch,  and
finishing with a forefoot flex for an
energised push-off.

Reebok-CCM Hockey innovates
in sticks and skates
At Reebok-CCM Hockey,  products
launched in 2010 accounted for 53%
of sales in North America.  Only 12%
of sales were generated with products
introduced three or more years ago.  In
2010,  Reebok-CCM Hockey launched
new lines of skates and sticks.  The
Reebok 11K skate combines the proven
Pump technology with the new Pro
Armour technology for improved supportincreased energy transfer and better
durability.  The CCM U+ Crazy Light
skate is the most customisable skate
on the market thanks to the UForm-3D
technology and the FluidFit system. 
The Reebok Sickick III stick with dual
matrix technology offers more feelbetter balance,  quicker reaction time
and faster shots.  Other technologically
driven products launched in 2010 include
Revoke Goalie equipment,  Smooth Air
mouthguards and CCM protective gear. 

Ambitious 2011 R&D targets
Our Group remains committed to
bringing at least one new revolutionary
technology or groundbreaking evolution
to the market each year  see Group
Strategy,  p.  80.  In 2011,  customisation
and digital sports products will be at
the forefront of adidas R&D activities
as we aim to position the brand as the
technology leader in this rapidly growing
category.  Reebok's R&D activities in
2011 will centre on the brand's strategy
to target fitness and training through
strength,  conditioning and flexibility
innovations.  Each of these will be
achieved respectively through the
expansion of the toning and ZigTech
platforms and with the introduction of
RealFlex,  a lightweight technology that
focuses on natural body movements. 
TaylorMade-adidas Golf's development
efforts will continue to reinforce industry
leadership by enhancing golfers'
performance through customisation
and adjustability features in woods and
forged irons.  Rockport will focus its
product development on light weightcomfort and walkability,  particularly for
the DresSports collection and women's
high-heeled shoes.  Reebok-CCM Hockey
will concentrate on introducing new
technologies in all categories,  including
skates with improved customisation for
the best fit at the lightest weight,  and
sticks with maximum power without
sacrificing accuracy and feel.

Employees
Becoming the global leader in the sporting goods industry depends on the potential,  dedication,  knowledge and performance
of our employees and the excellence of our leaders.  Therefore,  we foster a corporate culture of performance,  passion,  integrity
and diversity as we are convinced this is crucial to stimulate innovation,  team spirit and engagement. 
Engagement drives performance
We believe that employee satisfaction
drives commitment,  commitment drives
engagement,  and engagement drives
business performance.  Consequentlywe have defined engagement as one of
our Group's key performance indicators
for measuring our efforts to sustain
 'performance culture".  To capture
employee perceptions,  we introduced
formal engagement surveys in 2008. 
These enable us to evaluate our position
as the employer of choice for our
employees and also provide a framework
for benchmarking.  In 2010,  we conducted
the first Group-wide engagement survey. 
We achieved an outstanding participation
rate of 90% and an engagement
score which places us close to the topperforming organisations with respect to
engagement within the consumer goods
industry.  Compared to 2008,  when we
conducted an employee survey in various
regions,  we were able to increase our
engagement score significantly. 

This score was underpinned by our
employees' high level of confidence in
our senior leaders,  their perception
of clarity concerning the Group's
strategic direction as well as an open
and constructive work climate.  Areas
for further improvement identified by
employees included career development
and transparency,  availability of IT
tools and performance recognition.  Our
senior leaders are responsible for and
committed to increasing the engagement
scores.  As in previous years,  based on
the feedback received,  'Results-toAction teams" will be established to
drive initiatives to enhance the Group's
performance in the respective areas of
weakness. 

Enabling employees to reach
their personal best
To reach their personal best,  our Group's
employees are offered training to build
on their strengths,  improve their skills
and overcome their own challenges.  In
this process,  joining individual aspirations to our organisational needs is the
highest priority.  Our 'Competency Model"
defines a set of competencies to ensure
consistent and transparent performancetalent and succession management.  We
focus our efforts on three key success
drivers:
– Performance management
– Talent management
– Succession management
 see   01. 
Performance management: Our global
PEP (Performance Evaluation and
Planning) tool enables us to measure
all our employees against the required
competencies of their job level and their
performance,  but also to set individual
business targets and plan appropriate
training activities as necessary.  We
offer targeted training (behavioural and
managerial training) for individuals on
all levels of the organisation.  PEP is used
in all business units of the adidas Group
and the online PEP has a coverage of
71%.  The target for 2011 is to reach an
online coverage of 97% Group-wide. 

Three-pillar human resources strategy 
We strive to have the right team in place by focusing our
activities on the implementation and execution of our
Group's human resources strategy,  which is based on three
pillars:
–  reating a working environment that stimulates team

spirit,  passion,  engagement and achievement
see 'Engagement drives performance",  p.  115
see 'Internal communication activities to drive employee 
engagement",  p.  117

–  xpanding our performance culture based upon strong

leadership
see 'Enabling employees to reach their personal best",  p.  115
see 'Performance-driven remuneration system",  p.  116
see 'Creating an attractive work environment",  p.  117

–  eing an 'employer of choice"

Measures taken in order to implement our strategy are
explained in the text sections referred to above.

Success drivers for performance 
Performance-driven
remuneration system
We are committed to rewarding our
employees with compensation and
benefit programmes that are competitive
in the marketplace.  Remuneration
throughout the Group comprises fixed
and variable monetary compensationnon-monetary rewards,  as well as other
intangible benefits.  The cornerstone of
our rewards programme is our Global
Salary Management System which
is used as a basis to set the value of
employees' positions and salaries in
 market-driven and performanceoriented way.

Our development programmes are
complemented by apprenticeship and
internship programmes.  The adidas
Group apprenticeship offers young people
who want to join our Group straight out of
school the opportunity to gain business
experience in a three-year rotation
programme.  The programme includes
vocational training in retail,  industrial
management and IT as well as integrated
study programmes.  At the end of 2010we employed 55 apprentices in Germany
(2009: 58). 
Our global internship programme
gives students three to six months work
experience within the adidas Group.  For
'best-of-class" interns,  we continued
our 'ReBound" programme to foster
potential future employment.  At the end
of 2010,  we employed 320 interns in
Germany (2009: 331). 

Succession management: We have a
Group-wide succession management
process in place that helps us identify
succession risks as well as develop
designated or potential successors
for future management positions.  The
current succession situation for all
positions from Director level is discussed
regularly by senior management.  The
succession management process is
supported by a system solution which
hosts position and employee data
related to performance,  potential,  career
aspirations,  mobility,  etc.  Our system
solution is applied in 71% of the adidas
Group business units.  The target for 2011
is to reach a Group-wide online coverage
of 94%.

–  unctional Trainee Programme (FTP):

A 12- to 18-month programme giving
graduates with an international
background and excellent educational
credentials the opportunity to start
 functional career within the adidas
Group.  The programme comprises six
three-month assignments in varying
departments.  At least one of these
assignments takes place abroad. 
At year-end 2010,  we employed
36 participants in our global FTP
(2009: 39). 



Talent management: With specifically
designed talent management tools,  we
identify employees at all levels of our
Group who have the potential to become
future leaders in our organisation.  In
order to prepare employees for more
complex future roles,  they participate in
targeted development programmes for
various levels within the organisation:
–  xecutive Development Programme

(EDP): A global adidas Group
programme (cross-brand and crossfunctional) for employees who show
potential for the Executive level.  The
programme is centrally managed and
executed. 
–  anagement Development Programme

(MDP): A global adidas Group
programme which is executed regionally.  This programme is tailored to
employees from different functional
areas and brands who show potential
for the management level. 
–  eople Manager Development

Programme (PDP): A global adidas
Group programme which is executed
locally.  The programme targets
employees at a team leader level who
show potential for their next career
step. 
–  usiness Management Programme

(BMP): A 24-month international crossfunctional and cross-brand programme
aiming at attracting professionals with
MBA degrees and three to five years
work experience to prepare them for
future management positions within
our Group.  At year-end 2010,  six
employees were participating in the
BMP globally (2009: 5).

  Employees 
In addition to a fixed base salary,  we also
offer our employees various variable
compensation components. 
Bonus programme: In order to allow
our employees to participate in the
Group's success and to reward them
for their target achievement,  we have
implemented a global bonus programme. 
This programme combines individual
performance (measured in the PEP
process) and corporate performance
(actual financial results measured
against Group,  brand,  channel,  division
and/or business unit targets). 
Profit sharing: For employees at our
Group headquarters and our other
locations in Germany who do not
participate in the bonus programmewe have introduced a profit sharing
programme called 'Champions Bonus". 
Additional compensation components:
For senior management and Executive
Board members we offer Long-Term
Incentive Programmes (LTIP).  Other
benefits include our 401-K pension plans
in the USA and the adidas Group pension
plan for our employees in Germany.  In
2010,  2060 employees participated in
the latter,  which represents 58% of all
eligible employees. 
Our Group subsidiaries also grant
 variety of benefits to employees
depending on locally defined practices
and country-specific norms. 

Internal communication activities to
drive employee engagement
We believe that a robust internal
communication platform is essential
for driving employee engagement and
fostering open collaboration within
our organisation.  For example,  the
Group intranet has been transformed
over the past two years into blogs
allowing departments and teams to
quickly build and edit their own internal
communication platforms.  It also
enables employees to comment on
news,  share knowledge,  collaborate
and discuss current topics.  In 2010,  we
introduced a Group-wide idea forumallowing our employees to receive
recognition for their ideas and participate
in the implementation process.  For
2011,  our focus will be on knowledge
management and collaboration.  We plan
to implement a Microsoft SharePoint
platform which will enable us to have
one global,  integrated tool for knowledge
management.  This is part of a longerterm project to create a modern
continuous learning organisation. 

Diverse workforce to achieve
global goals
As a global company,  we understand
that it takes people with different
ideas,  strengths,  interests and cultural
backgrounds to ensure we achieve
our goals.  A high degree of diversity
is already reflected in our workforce. 
At our corporate headquarters,  for
example,  we have employees from more
than 50 countries.  We act to assure an
environment that embraces diversity
through various initiatives such as
networking events,  intercultural training
and our work-life integration department. 
Creating an attractive work environment
We aim to harmonise the commercial
interests of the adidas Group with
the private and family needs of our
employees.  Our work-life balance
programme includes family-oriented
services,  flexible work time and placepeople development and leadership
competence related to work-life balance.

aurach,  Portland and Canton and at
other subsidiaries have access to a
company gym.  Our Company Sports
department in Herzogenaurach also
organises various sports activities such
as mountain biking,  kayaking or ski
tours.  Special events such as a one-week
sports camp for employees' childrentrans-alpine mountain bike tours and the
annual Berlin Marathon weekend (with
 suitable training programme prior to
the event) are also available.  In 2010,  the
Company Sports department in Germany
offered about 225 courses and more than
40 events which were attended by more
than 3600 participants (2009: >3000).

  Group Management Report Our Group 

Global employee base continues to grow
On December 31,  2010,  the Group
had 42541 employees,  which represents an increase of 7% versus 39596
in the previous year.  This development
is primarily related to new employees
in the Retail segment,  mainly on a
part-time basis.  On a full-time equivalent
basis,  our Group had 36444 employees
on December 31,  2010 (2009: 34437). 
Due to the high share of employees
working on a part-time basis in the Retail
segment,  this figure is lower than the
figure reported on a headcount basis
 see   08.  Personnel expenses increased
12% to € 1521 billion in 2010 from
€ 1352 billion in 2009  see Note 31,  p.  215representing 30% of the Group's total
operating expenses (2009: 31%) and 13%
of Group sales (2009: 13%).

Own-retail activities in emerging
markets drive employee growth
The number of employees working in
the Wholesale segment decreased 8%
to 4329 at the end of 2010 (2009: 4723)mainly due to reorganisation measures
following the implementation of the joint
operating model in 2009.  Staff in our
Retail segment increased 14%,  primarily
as a result of the expansion of own-retail
activities in emerging markets.  The Retail
segment comprised 22286 employees
at year-end (2009: 19576).  In Other
Businesses,  the number of employees
decreased by 4% to 1676 (2009: 1750)primarily due to reorganisation initiatives
at TaylorMade-adidas Golf and ReebokCCM Hockey.  The number of employees
working in our headquarter functions
increased by 5% to 14250 (2009: 13547). 
This development reflects the changes in
the organisation structure. 
At the end of 2010,  23% of our
Group's staff were employed in Western
Europe (2009: 23%),  34% in European
Emerging Markets (2009: 31%),  24%
in North America (2009: 25%),  4% in
Greater China (2009: 8%),  9% in Other
Asian Markets (2009: 6%) and 6% in
Latin America (2009: 7%).  As a global
company with less than 9% of our
employees located in Germany,  we
actively encourage global mobility and
offer our employees the opportunity to
go on international assignments.  To
support relocating professionals and
their families in new living and working
environments,  we provide,  for examplerelevant language and cultural training.

Challenges in human resources
management
With the economy picking up,  the
so-called 'war for talent" is heating up
 see Risk and Opportunity Report,  p.  158. 
More than ever,  we challenge ourselves
to do what it takes to be and remain
the employer of choice for the talents
we need.  During 2010,  we received top
rankings as an employer of choiceproving that the adidas Group is one
of the leading employers for school
leavers and students/graduates.  In
order to further strengthen this positionwe continued to push our activities at
schools and universities throughout 2010. 

By partnering with select universities
around the globe,  we strive to foster our
strong employer image through direct
contact with top graduates.  We continued
to build upon our key university strategy
roll-out in 2010,  where members of the
Executive Board and other senior executives of the Group shared their business
insights at selected top universities and
business schools such as the London
Business School,  the IESE in Barcelona
and universities in Germany such as
in Mannheim and Nuremberg.  When it
comes to highly qualified personnel,  the
adidas Group faces increasing competition in the international labour market. 
We will continue to tackle this challenge
with innovative programmes,  such as
an employee referral programme which
was introduced in 2010.  As part of our
Group-wide strategic business plan
(Route 2015),  which defines strategies
and objectives for the period up to 2015Human Resources will further build upon
existing programmes and concepts.  We
will focus in particular on initiatives to
enhance our performance,  learning and
leadership culture.

Sustainability
The adidas Group is responsible and accountable for developing and implementing sustainable business practices that adhere
to our operational needs as well as our social and environmental obligations.  As a consequence,  we continuously engage with
our various stakeholders in a collaborative way with the goal of enhancing the social and environmental performance of the
Group.  We believe that acting as good corporate citizens will improve our reputation and hence our economic value. 

Engaging our stakeholders
At the adidas Group,  we pursue a
policy of open dialogue with numerous
stakeholders,  involving them in key social
and environmental decisions that shape
day-to-day operations.  Through in-depth
engagement with,  for example,  the Better
Cotton Initiative,  the Leather Working
Group and the AFIRM Working Groupwe work closely with leading companies
from a variety of sectors to develop
sustainable business approaches and to
debate social and environmental topics
on a global level.  This is also supported
by our membership in organisations
such as the World Business Council
for Sustainable Development (WBCSD)the World Federation of the Sporting
Goods Industry (WFSGI),  the Fair
Factories Clearinghouse (FFC) and
the Fair Labor Association (FLA).  In
addition,  we recognise that open and
honest communication enhances the
transparency of our business and
demonstrates our commitment to being
accountable. 

Workplace Standards set rules
in the supply chain
We have a responsibility to our
employees and the workers in our
suppliers' factories as well as the
environment.  Malpractice in these areasin particular human rights violations
and dubious employment practicescan have a significant impact on the
reputation and operational efficiency of
our Group and our suppliers.  Thereforecovering health and safety,  labour rights
and environmental protection at our
own sites and our suppliers' factories
is of the highest importance to us. 
We have defined rules or standards
embedding our own corporate values as
well as those society expects of global
businesses.  These standards follow
International Labour Organization (ILO)
and United Nations conventions relating
to human rights and employment
practices,  as well as the WFSGI model
code of conduct.  We have condensed
our rules into a supplier code of
conduct that we call our 'Workplace
Standards".  These Standards help us
select manufacturing partners and
serve as guiding principles in the early
identification and treatment of potential
issues of concern at our suppliers' sites. 

120 

  Sustainability 
  Group Management Report Our Group 

To illustrate how suppliers should
implement our Standards,  we have
created a set of detailed guidelines
for use in factory settings,  which are
updated on a regular basis by our
Social and Environmental Affairs (SEA)
team.  The guidelines are also used to
determine suppliers' compliance with
our Standards and to advise and train our
suppliers in improving their social and
environmental performance. 
Our Workplace Standards contain clear
rules of conduct regarding:
–  nvironmentally sound,  safe and

healthy working conditions
–  air wages and benefits

–  reedom of association

–  rohibition of excessive overtimeP
forced and child labour
–  rotection against harassment and

discrimination. 

Careful supplier selection
To improve working conditions
throughout our supply chain,  the Global
Operations function works closely with
our SEA team on supplier selection.  The
SEA team assesses all potential new
suppliers,  and orders can only be placed
with a new supplier when SEA approval
has been granted.

Encouraging self-governance
We help our core business partners in
establishing management systems with
internationally recognised standards
such as ISO 14001 for environmental
management as we believe good
management systems help factories
improve their day-to-day operations and
support the process of self-­ overnance. 

By running a certified management
system,  our suppliers demonstrate
commitment to continuously enhancing
their performance.  We help them build
or improve human resources systems
to maintain proper working conditionsincluding factory grievance systems to
routinely find and fix non-compliance
issues.  Further,  by enforcing employment standards at the sites of our

­ anufacturing suppliers,  we empower
workers to protect their own rights and
take an active role in decision-making. 

Training to achieve sustainable
compliance
Our SEA team offers specific training
courses and workshops for factory
supervisors and managers to help them
apply our Standards and implement best
practices.  These workshops include,  for
example,  introductory training on our
Workplace Standards and SEA operating
guidelines and detailed training on
effective health,  safety and environmental
practices.  Further,  we promote the
establishment of structures that actively
involve workers and management of
our suppliers,  as well as local employee
associations and non-governmental
organisations (NGOs).  Our team also
organises workshops for licenseesagents and adidas Group business
entities in order to strengthen personnel
capacities throughout our company.  In
this way,  the consideration of acceptable
working conditions becomes a routine
part of business activities.  In 2010the SEA team conducted 193 training
sessions and workshops (2009: 216). 
Monitoring through factory inspections
The SEA team assesses compliance with
our Workplace Standards by means of
factory inspections.  Our auditors check
performance against a customised risk
list for each factory that is monitored. 
The methodology is linked to a factory
rating which measures the effectiveness of compliance systems and the work
of their administrators.  This enables us
to precisely determine training needs
at our suppliers' factories.  During 2010we conducted 1451 factory visits (2009:
1592 visits) involving management and
worker interviews,  document reviewfacility inspections and training sessions
at different levels in our supply chain
 see   01. 

In addition to our own monitoring
activities,  we value independent
assessment by third parties to
demonstrate the credibility of and
provide verified information about
our programme to stakeholders.  As a
member of the Fair Labor Association
(FLA),  the adidas Group is subject to
external assessment by independent
monitors,  participation in the FLA thirdparty complaint system and public
reporting.  In 2008,  the monitoring
programme of the adidas Group was
re-accredited by the FLA.  This decision
was based on independent factory
monitoring and verification reports
of supplier facilities,  and a thorough
audit of monitoring protocols,  training
programmes and auditing systems. 
Since joining the FLA,  more than 250
Independent External Monitoring (IEM)
audits and verification visits have been
conducted at adidas Group suppliers.

Warning-letter system to
enforce compliance
Where a manufacturing supplier is
performing poorly in terms of Workplace
Standards compliance,  we will work
closely with them to find solutions. 
However,  when we find ongoing and
serious instances of non-compliance
and a lack of commitment from factory
management to address the issueswe send out a formal warning letter
including a notification to factory
management that their business
relationship with the adidas Group is in
jeopardy.  Three warning letters result
in termination.  In 2010,  we did not have
to terminate our business relationship
with any supplier for compliance reasons
(2009: 9 terminations).

Strategic approach to managing
environmental impacts and tackling
climate change
Tackling climate change poses a number
of challenges for our company and
our manufacturing partners.  Having
analysed the environmental footprint of
our business operations and building
on existing environmental initiatives,  we
developed an Environmental Strategy in
2010 with defined targets until 2015.  With
this strategy,  we strive to continuously
reduce the company's environmental
footprint by applying environmental best
practice in our daily work and in the
supply chain.  We systematically look at
all relevant parts of the business and
value chain to become more thoughtful
and efficient in using resources as well
as help reduce operational costs.  Our
initiatives span from product design
and creation to sourcing and manufacturing,  also covering our own sites,  ownretail stores and all other sales points. 
The focus is on energy,  water conservation and discharge,  waste and chemicals. 
More details on our Environmental
Strategy can be found in our 2010 Social
and Environmental Online Report and
on our website at www, adidas-Group, com/
sustainability. 

Improving our environmental
footprint at own sites
As an important part of our Group's
Environmental Strategy,  we launched the
Green Company Initiative,  which targets
reducing the environmental footprint
of our own sites.  The initiative provides
 supporting framework,  guidance and
communication platform for all Group
entities to improve their environmental
footprint. 
As part of this initiative,  we have
set Group-wide and site-specific 2015
targets related to savings in energy
use,  carbon emissions,  water usage
and paper as well as sourcing green
energy.  In these areas,  our goals include
cutting the relative energy use by 20%the relative carbon emissions by 30%and reducing paper use by 50% per
employee.  Further targets have been
specified for waste,  purchasing practices
and mobility management.  In addition
to the overall company goals,  several
sites have set their own specific targets. 
One of the key goals within the Green
Company Initiative has been to obtain
ISO 14001 certification for environmental
management systems established at six
major administration sites of the adidas
Group.  This was achieved for five major
sites in 2010,  all located in North America
(Portland,  Carlsbad,  Canton,  Montreal
and Spartanburg).  The certification of the
adidas Group Headquarters site 'World of
Sports" in Herzogenaurach is scheduled
­
for 2011.

Driving environmental improvements
in our supply chain
In the supply chain,  activities focus
on helping suppliers establish sound
environmental management systems at
their manufacturing plants to best reduce
their negative environmental impacts.  We
have developed guidelines and training
programmes for our suppliers,  using
the environmental performance of our
own production sites as examples of best
practice. 
In 2010,  our Group's supply base
included 24 athletic footwear supplier
factories which were OHSAS 18000 and/
or ISO 14001 certified.  These factories
produced around 83% of our footwear
sourcing volume.  The remaining part
of our footwear sourcing volume
is produced in factories that have
management systems in place but have
not been certified.  All footwear factories
are regularly assessed against the adidas
Group's standards regarding environment
and workplace health and safety.  A range
of other activities have been implemented
to reduce our carbon footprint in the
supply and distribution chain.  Examples
of these are in the areas of transportation
and energy use.  In the transportation of
our products,  our policy is to minimise
the impacts,  in particular from air freight
shipments,  through improved order and
production planning tools.

Control and monitoring of
restricted substances
Restricted substances are those
that cause harm or are suspected to
cause harm to human health or the
environment.  Our suppliers are required
to avoid using restricted substances. 
We have specified clear standards that
follow the strictest local regulations
and best practice standards for
consumer care and safety.  This policy is
mandatory for all business partners and
is updated regularly based on findings
in our ongoing dialogue with scientific
organisations.  Our standards cover the
general requirements for eco-labels
and green seals (e.g.  ÖKO-Tex Standard
100,  Toxproof TÜV Rheinland,  etc. )
for footwear,  apparel and hardware
products.  Both our own quality assurance
laboratories and external testing
institutes are used to constantly monitor
material samples to ensure supplier
compliance with these requirements. 
Materials that do not meet our standards
and specifications are rejected. 
Reducing VOC emissions
Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)which are typically found in solvents used
in our manufacturing process,  can,  in a
high concentration,  cause breathing difficulties and other health problems for
production workers.  Therefore,  we are
committed to reducing VOC emissions in
our suppliers' footwear factories to an
average VOC emission of 20 grams per
pair of shoes. 

Our efforts reflect the technical synergies
of sharing information,  data and
sources on production questions such
as water-based cement systems.  At
our core athletic footwear suppliers we
measure exposure to such emissionsand the records taken provide evidence
that workers are not being exposed to
dangerous levels of VOCs.  Our athletic
footwear suppliers in Asia and Europe
have reduced VOC emissions from 130
grams per pair in 1999 to 248 grams
per pair in 2010 (2009: 226)  see   02. 
For comparison,  the limit value of the
European VOC guideline and provision
31 of the German law on pollution
control (31.  Verordnung des BundesImmissionsschutzgesetzes) is 25 grams
per pair of shoes.  Both regulations
became effective in 2007. 

Environmentally optimised
product concepts
adidas Sport Performance runs a
sustainable product programme called
'Better Place",  which focuses on the
efficient use of resources in the design
and selection of materials.  The first
adidas 'Better Place" products were
introduced globally in spring/summer
2009 in response to consumers'
increasing demand for sustainable sports
apparel and footwear.  The products
feature environmental design,  construction,  material composition and packaging
that distinguish them as environmentally
sustainable products.  All materials that
are used for 'Better Place" have to pass
an in-depth assessment. 

adidas recorded a considerable increase
in 'Better Place" products sold in 2010
which provides a strong base to grow
the proportion of sustainable products
in forthcoming seasons.  We see sizeable
business opportunities for our Group in
the area of sustainable product concepts
 see Risk and Opportunity Report,  p.  158.  It is
therefore our target that by 2012 100%
of adidas Sport Performance footwear
products will have some sustainable
content.

Internal Group Management System
The principal financial goal for increasing shareholder value at the adidas Group is maximising operating cash flow.  We strive
to achieve this goal by continually improving our top- and bottom-line performance while at the same time optimising the use
of invested capital.  Our Group's planning and controlling system is therefore designed to provide a variety of tools to assess
our current performance and to align future strategic and investment decisions to best utilise commercial and organisational
opportunities. 

Operating cash flow as Internal Group
Management focus
We believe operating cash flow to be
the most important driver to increase
shareholder value.  Operating cash
flow is comprised of operating profitchange in operating working capital
and net re-investments (capital
expenditure less depreciation and
amortisation)  see   01.  To maximise
operating cash flow generation across
our organisation,  management of our
operating segments and management
at market level have direct responsibility
for improving operating profit as well
as optimising operating working capital
and capital expenditure.  To keep senior
management focused on long-term
performance improvements we have
adopted a modified economic value
added (EVA) model.  The asset base of
 market or operating unit within the
Group is subject to a percentage capital
charge to the operating profit of the
respective business unit.  The asset base
includes the working capital as well
as other assets needed by a market
or operating unit in its day-to-day
operations.  The resulting internal KPI is
called Contribution After Capital Charge
(CACC) and is used as one of the primary
targets for the variable component of
managers' compensation.  This concept
was introduced Group-wide in 2010. 

126 

Operating margin as key performance
indicator of operational progress
Operating margin (defined as operating
profit as a percentage of net sales) is
our Group's most important measure
of operational success.  It highlights the
quality of our top line and operational
efficiency. 
The primary drivers central to enhancing
operating margin are:
–  ales and gross margin development:

Management focuses on identifying
and exploiting opportunities that not
only provide for future growth,  but
also have potential to increase gross
margin (defined as gross profit as a
percentage of net sales).  Major levers
for enhancing our Group's sales and
gross margin include
–  ptimising our product mixo
– ncreasing the quality of distributioni
with a particular focus on controlled
space–  upply chain efficiency initiativess
–  inimisation of clearance activities. 
 
  Group Management Report Financial Review 

  Internal Group Management System 
– Operating expense control: We put 
high emphasis on tightly controlling
operating expenses to leverage the
Group's sales growth through to the
bottom line.  This requires a particular
focus on ensuring flexibility in the
Group's cost base.  Marketing working
budget is our largest operating
expense.  It is one of the most important
mechanisms for driving top-line
growth.  Therefore,  we are committed
to improving the utilisation of our
marketing expenditure.  This includes
concentrating our communication
efforts (including advertising,  retail
presentation and public relations)
on key global brand initiatives and
focusing our promotion spend on wellselected partnerships with top eventsleagues,  clubs and athletes.  We also
aim to increase operational efficiency
and reduce operating overhead
expenses as a percentage of sales.  In
this respect,  we constantly review our
operational structure streamlining
business processes,  eliminating
redundancies and leveraging the scale
of our organisation.  These measures
may also be supplemented by shortterm initiatives such as temporarily
curtailing operational investments,  for
example staff hiring.

 see   03.  If necessary,  action plans
are implemented to optimise the
development of the Group's operating
performance. 

Optimisation of non-operating
components
Our Group also puts a high priority on the
optimisation of non-operating components such as financial expenses and
taxes,  as these items strongly impact
the Group's cash outflows and therefore
the Group's free cash flow.  Financial
expenses are managed centrally by
our Group Treasury department  see
Treasury,  p.  146.  The Group's current and
future tax expenditure is optimised
globally by our Group Taxes department. 
Tight operating working capital
management
Due to a comparatively low level of
fixed assets required in our businessthe efficiency of the Group's balance
sheet depends to a large degree on our
operating working capital management. 
Our key metric is operating working
capital as a percentage of net sales. 
Monitoring the development of this key
metric facilitates the measurement of our
progress in improving the efficiency of
our business cycle.  We have significantly
enhanced operating working capital
management over recent years through
continuous improvement of our Group's
inventories,  accounts receivable and
accounts payable. 

We strive to manage our inventory levels
to meet market demand and ensure
fast replenishment.  Inventory ageing is
controlled to reduce inventory obsolescence and to optimise clearance activities.  As a result,  stock turn development
is the key performance indicator as it
measures the number of times average
inventory is sold during a year,  highlighting the efficiency of capital locked
up in products in relation to our Group's
business.  To minimise capital tied up in
accounts receivable,  we strive to improve
collection efforts in order to reduce the
Days of Sales Outstanding (DSO) and
improve the ageing of accounts receivable.  Likewise,  we strive to optimise
payment terms with our suppliers to best
manage our accounts payable. 

Capital expenditure targeted to
maximise future returns
Improving the effectiveness of the
Group's capital expenditure is another
lever to maximise the Group's operating
cash flow.  Our capital expenditure is
controlled with a top-down,  bottom-up
approach: In a first step,  Group
Management defines focus areas and
an overall investment budget based
on investment requests from various
functions of the organisation.  Our
operating units then align their initiatives
within the scope of assigned priorities
and available budget.  We evaluate
potential return on planned investments
utilising the net present value.  Risk is
accounted for,  adding a risk premium to
the cost of capital and decreasing future
revenue streams where appropriate. 
By means of scenario planning,  the
sensitivity of investment returns is tested
against changes in initial assumptions. 
For large investment projects,  timelines
and deviations versus budget are
monitored on a monthly basis throughout
the course of the project.

M&A activities focus on long-term
value creation potential
We see the majority of our Group's
future growth opportunities in our
organic business.  However,  as part of
our commitment to ensuring sustainable
profitable development we regularly
review merger and acquisition options
that may provide additional commercial
and operational opportunities.  Acquisitive
growth focus is primarily related to
improving our Group's positioning within
 sports category,  strengthening our
technology portfolio or addressing new
consumer segments. 
The strategies of any potential acquisition candidate must correspond with
the Group's direction.  Maximising return
on invested capital above the cost of
capital in the long term is a core consideration in our decision-making process. 
Of particular importance is evaluating
the potential impact on our Group's
free cash flow.  We assess current and
future projected key financial metrics to
evaluate a target's contribution potential. 
In addition,  careful consideration is given
to potential financing needs and their
impact on the Group's financial leverage. 

128 

Cost of capital metric used to measure
investment potential
Creating value for our shareholders
by earning a return on invested capital
above the cost of that capital is a
guiding principle of our Group strategy. 
We source capital from equity and
debt markets.  Therefore,  we have a
responsibility that our return on capital
meets the expectations of both equity
shareholders and creditors.  Our Group
calculates the cost of capital utilising
the weighted average cost of capital
(WACC) formula.  This metric allows us to
calculate the minimum required financial
returns of planned capital investments. 
The cost of equity is computed utilising
the risk-free rate,  market risk premium
and beta.  Cost of debt is calculated using
the risk-free rate,  credit spread and
average tax rate.

Structured performance
measurement system
Our Group has developed an extensive
performance measurement systemwhich utilises a variety of tools to
measure the performance of the adidas
Group.  The Group's key financial metrics
are monitored and compared against
budget on a monthly basis.  The focus
is on operating cash flow,  CACC,  salesoperating margin,  operating working
capital and net debt development
 see   02.  When negative deviations
exist between actual and target numberswe perform a detailed analysis to
identify and address the cause.  We also
benchmark our Group's financial results
with those of our major competitors
on a quarterly basis.  To assess current
sales and profitability developmentManagement analyses sell-through
information from our own-retail
distribution as well as short-term
replenishment orders from retailers. 
Taking into account year-to-date
performance as well as opportunities
and risks,  the Group's full year financial
performance is forecasted on a quarterly
basis. 

In this respect,  backlogs comprising
orders received up to nine months in
advance of the actual sale are used as an
indicator.  However,  due to the growing
share of own retail in our business mix
as well as fluctuating order patterns
among our wholesale partners,  our order
books are less indicative of anticipated
revenues compared to the past.  As a
result of the growing share of at-once
business,  qualitative feedback from
our retail partners on the success of
our collections at the point of sale is
becoming even more important.  As an
early indicator for future performancewe also conduct market research to
measure brand appeal,  brand awareness
and resulting purchase intent. 

Management appraisal of
performance and targets
We communicate our Group's financial
targets on an annual basis.  We also
provide updates throughout the year as
appropriate.  In 2010,  Group sales and
net income increased significantly.  While
Retail revenues increased at doubledigit rates,  sales in the Wholesale
segment and in Other Businesses grew
at single-digit rates.  Increased Retail
sales in the emerging markets resulted
in Group revenues exceeding our initial
guidance of a low- to mid-single-digit
increase.  Group sales development
outperformed macroeconomic and global
industry growth  see Economic and Sector
Development,  p.  130,  mainly due to strong
sales increases in most geographical
areas. 

Profitability increased at a higher rate
than originally anticipated as a result
of higher gross margins partly due to
the strong performance of our Retail
segment.  As a result of continued focus
on operating working capital and cash
management,  we achieved all of our
goals related to balance sheet improvements in 2010. 
Our expectations for the Group's
business performance in 2011 are based
on the assumption of an improvement in
the global economy,  a strengthening of
our business in the emerging markets
and a strong product pipeline which
has received favourable reviews from
retailers.  This,  as well as an improved
balance sheet,  should lead to increases
in sales and earnings per share in 2011. 
Profitability improvements,  howeverwill be dampened by increasing raw
material and labour costs which our
industry is facing.  In 2012 and beyondassuming further improvements in the
global economy,  we are confident to
further increase sales and earnings per
share as outlined under our Route 2015
strategic business plan.  We believe that
our outlook is realistic within the scope
of the current trading environment.  No
material event between the end of 2010
and the publication of this report has
altered our view  see Subsequent Events
and Outlook,  p.  174.

Group Business Performance
In 2010,  the adidas Group results improved significantly compared to the prior year.  Currency-neutral Group sales increased
9% as a result of growth in the Wholesale and Retail segments as well as in Other Businesses.  In euro terms,  adidas Group
revenues grew 15% to € 11990 billion from € 10381 billion in 2009.  The Group's gross margin increased 24 percentage points
to 478% (2009: 454%),  supported by less clearance sales and a larger share of higher-margin Retail sales.  Consequently,  the
Group's gross profit rose 22% to € 5730 billion in 2010 versus € 4712 billion in 2009.  The Group's operating margin improved
26 percentage points to 75% from 49% in 2009,  primarily due to the higher gross margin as well as lower other operating
expenses as a percentage of sales.  The Group's operating profit grew 76% to € 894 million in 2010 versus € 508 million in
2009.  The Group's net income attributable to shareholders increased 131% to € 567 million from € 245 million in 2009.  Diluted
earnings per share grew 122% to € 271 in 2010 versus € 122 in 2009. 

Economic and Sector
Development
Global economy recovers in 2010
Following the global economic recession
in 2009,  the macroeconomic environment
improved notably over the course of
2010 as global gross domestic product
(GDP) increased 39% compared to a
decline of 22% in the prior year.  This
recovery was mainly driven by rapid
growth in emerging economies,  boosted
by global export activities and industrial
production.  Despite the positive GDP
developments,  sovereign debt concerns
and high unemployment rates in most
major Western economies weighed on
economic expansion. 
In Western Europe,  GDP increased
by 18% (2009: decline of 41%),  driven
by strong export volumes.  However,  the
sovereign debt crisis,  in some of the
region's peripheral countries,  coupled
with high unemployment levels and acute
austerity measures inhibited growth and
confidence in many economies. 

130 

Despite similar challenges,  European
emerging markets continued their
recovery in 2010 with GDP growth of
around 39% (2009: decline of 34%),  due
to rising levels of fixed investment and
improving domestic consumer demand
compared to the prior year. 
In the USA,  GDP increased by 29%
in 2010 compared to a decline of 26%
in the prior year,  driven by rebounding
investment levels,  both from the
private and public sector.  Much of this
activity was supported by the continued
fiscal and monetary stimuli adopted
by policymakers.  In addition,  the
depreciation of the US dollar positively
impacted exports from the region. 

  Group Management Report Financial Review 

Despite the overall economic upturn,  high
levels of unemployment and relatively
low house prices remained as a negative
pressure on consumer spending,  which
only increased modestly in the year.

  Economic and Sector Development 
In 2010,  Asian economies continued to
lead the global economic recovery,  with
GDP increasing 67% (2009: 03%),  driven
by industrial production and resilience
in domestic demand and retail sales. 
China's GDP grew by 100% in 2010
(2009: 91%),  mainly due to growth in
industrial production and export volumes. 
This economic development supported
further wage growth and saw consumer
spending rise by 95%.  Most other
economies in the region also posted
similar trends,  including India where GDP
growth is projected at 92%. 
Japan's GDP gain,  however,  was
lower than the regional average at
43% (2009: decline of 63%).  Economic
recovery in Japan was driven by export
demand from other Asian economies. 
However,  the appreciation of the yen put
pressure on international trade levels and
together with a sluggish labour market
led to weakening GDP trends towards the
end of the year. 
In Latin America,  full year GDP
increased 66% (2009: decline of
34%).  The strong recovery was mainly
attributable to rising commodity
prices and strong domestic demand. 
Furthermore,  the rise in employment
rates and income levels stimulated
consumer spending in the region. 

Positive growth in the global
sporting goods industry
In 2010,  the sporting goods industry
benefited from the broad-based
improvement in consumer confidence
and spending levels in most regions and
markets around the world.  The 2010
FIFA World Cup contributed strongly
to the positive trends,  particularly in
Western Europe and Latin America. 
The turnaround of the inventory cycle
in the first half of 2010 supported the
sector in many major markets.  A robust
back-to-school period in North America
and Europe maintained the positive
momentum in the second half.  Increasing
consumer spending levels gave further
impetus to the expansion of the sporting
goods industry in the emerging marketsparticularly in Asia and Latin America. 
Lower input costs as well as less
clearance activity positively impacted the
industry's profitability. 

FIFA World Cup adds momentum to
Europe's sporting goods industry
In 2010,  the European sporting goods
industry grew modestly.  The region
benefited sustainably from the 2010
FIFA World Cup,  with three out of
the last four teams coming from
the region.  Nevertheless,  there was
significant country variation with high
unemployment levels depressing
consumer spending in generalparticularly in the region's peripheral
countries.  Sales in both footwear and
apparel increased in Europe,  with
footwear rebounding faster than apparel. 
The latter,  however,  benefited later in the
year due to cold weather conditions.

North American sporting goods industry
driven by volume and average price
increases
In the USA,  we estimate that sporting
goods sales increased at a mid-singledigit rate in 2010,  driven by increases in
average selling prices and volumes.  Lean
inventory levels in the first half of 2010
helped retailers minimise promotion and
discounting activities,  thus driving up
average prices for the industry.  Improving
momentum was also supported by
increasing levels of consumer spending
with both the back-to-school and holiday
season recording strong results in the
second half.  Footwear sales are projected
to have increased at a high-single-digit
rate in 2010,  driven in particular by
growth in the toning,  running,  basketball
and outdoor categories.  Increasing
demand for functional apparel helped to
offset declines in licensed apparel.  The
equipment market in the region remained
subdued,  with the golf market seeing
further declines in 2010. 

Asian sporting goods industry expands
Asia's sporting goods industry grew
at a high-single-digit rate in 2010primarily driven by the region's emerging
economies.  In China,  rising levels of
domestic demand and increasing wages
as well as continued retail expansion
resulted in a growth rate of around 20%
for the industry.  In Japan,  however,  in line
with the overall weakness in consumer
spending,  the sporting goods industry
declined in 2010.  While the toning
category provided some positive impetus
on footwear,  in general,  both footwear
and apparel sales at retail remained
highly promotional in Japan. 

Positive momentum in Latin American
sporting goods market continues
In 2010,  the Latin American sporting
goods industry recorded a strong
performance with a double-digit growth
rate.  The substantial economic growth
in the region in 2010 coupled with the
positive effects of the FIFA World Cup
resulted in relatively high consumer
spending on sporting goods,  particularly
in the football category. 
adidas Group and competitors
outperform economic environment
adidas Group revenues and profitability
as well as those of many competitors
and retailers increased in 2010.  In
most regions,  sales of our Group and
other major sporting goods companies
increased more significantly than GDP
and overall consumer spending.

Income Statement
Segmental reporting
comparatives updated
Following minor changes to the adidas
Group's organisational structure in the
first quarter of 2010,  the assignment
of certain functions has been changed
compared to the Group's prior year
annual financial statements.  This
development has a limited effect on the
Group segmental structure.  To ensure
full comparability of Group financial
results in 2010,  the Group has decided to
adjust the segmental reporting for 2009
retrospectively.  These adjustments have
no effect on total Group financial results. 
Details of the adjustments are available
in the Notes see Note 35,  p.  218. 
adidas Group currency-neutral
sales increase 9% in 2010
In 2010,  Group revenues grew 9% on a
currency-neutral basis,  as a result of
sales increases in Wholesale,  Retail and
Other Businesses.  This development
exceeded initial Management
expectations of a low- to mid-singledigit Group sales increase.  Currency
translation effects had a positive impact
on sales in euro terms.  Group revenues
grew 15% to € 11990 billion in 2010 from
€ 10381 billion in 2009 see   07. 

Wholesale and Retail segments drive
strong sales growth in 2010
In 2010,  currency-neutral sales grew
in all segments.  Currency-neutral
Wholesale revenues increased 8% during
the period due to sales growth at both
adidas and Reebok.  Currency-neutral
Retail sales increased 18% versus the
prior year as a result of adidas and
Reebok sales growth.  Revenues in Other
Businesses were up 2% on a currencyneutral basis.  Sales grew at TaylorMadeadidas Golf,  Rockport and Reebok-CCM
Hockey.  Currency translation effects
had a positive impact on segmental
sales in euro terms.  Wholesale revenues
increased 14% to € 8181 billion in
2010 from € 7164 billion in 2009. 
Retail sales rose 25% to € 2389 billion
versus € 1906 billion in the prior
year.  Sales in Other Businesses grew
10% to € 1420 billion in 2010 (2009:
€ 1293 billion). 

Currency-neutral sales increase
in nearly all regions
In 2010,  currency-neutral adidas Group
sales grew in all regions except Greater
China.  Revenues in Western Europe
increased 7% on a currency-neutral
basis,  primarily as a result of doubledigit sales growth in the UK,  Germany
and Spain.  In European Emerging
Markets,  Group sales increased 16% on
 currency-neutral basis due to growth
in most of the region's markets,  in
particular Russia.  Sales for the adidas
Group in North America grew 12% on
 currency-neutral basis due to strong
increases in both the USA and Canada. 
Sales in Greater China decreased 2% on a
currency-neutral basis.  Currency-neutral
revenues in Other Asian Markets grew
6% due to increases in most markets. 
In Latin America,  sales grew 14% on a

Group sales up in all product categories
In 2010,  Group sales grew in all product
categories on a currency-neutral
basis.  Currency-neutral footwear sales
increased 9% during the period.  This
development was due to growth in the
football,  running and outdoor categories. 
Apparel revenues increased 9% on a
currency-neutral basis,  driven by growth
in football,  running and basketball. 
Currency-neutral hardware sales
increased 5% compared to the prior yearprimarily due to strong growth in the
football category.  Currency translation
effects had a positive impact on sales in
euro terms see   13. 

Cost of sales increases
Cost of sales is defined as the amount
we pay to third parties for expenses
associated with producing and delivering
our products.  Own-production expenses
are also included in the Group's cost
of sales.  However,  these expenses
represent only a very small portion
of total cost of sales.  In 2010,  cost of
sales was € 6260 billion,  representing
an increase of 10% compared to
€ 5669 billion in 2009.  This development
was mainly due to increasing sourcing
volumes in footwear,  apparel and
hardware.  The optimisation of sourcing
processes as well as the reduction of
input costs as a result of lower raw
material prices at the time of sourcing
had a positive impact on cost of sales.

Group gross margin improves
24 percentage points
The gross margin of the adidas Group
increased 24 percentage points to
478% in 2010 (2009: 454%) see   15. 
This development was mainly due to
lower input costs,  less clearance sales
and a larger share of higher-margin
Retail sales.  As a result,  gross profit for
the adidas Group grew 22% in 2010 to
€ 5730 billion versus € 4712 billion in
the prior year see   14. 
Royalty and commission income grows
Royalty and commission income for
the adidas Group increased 16% to
€ 100 million in 2010 from € 86 million
in the prior year.  On a currency-neutral
basis,  royalty and commission income
was up 12%,  mainly as a result of
higher licensee sales.  New licensee
partnerships also had a positive effect
on the Group's royalty and commission
income. 

Other operating income increases 10%
Other operating income includes items
such as gains from the disposal of fixed
assets and releases of accruals and
provisions.  In 2010,  other operating
income increased 10% to € 110 million
(2009: € 100 million),  mainly due to
the settlement of a lawsuit and the
divestiture of a trademark. 
Other operating expenses as
a percentage of sales down
02 percentage points
Other operating expenses,  including
depreciation and amortisation,  consist
of items such as sales working
budget,  marketing working budget and
operating overhead costs.  In euro termsother operating expenses increased
15% to € 5046 billion in 2010 (2009:
€ 4390 billion),  as a result of the
expansion of the Group's own-retail
activities and higher marketing
expenditure see   17.  However,  other
operating expenses as a percentage
of sales decreased 02 percentage
points to 421% in 2010 from 423% in
2009 see   18. 

Sales working budget increases
as a percentage of sales
Sales working budget consists of
expenses to support the Group's sellthrough development.  Expenditures
relate to advertising and promotion
initiatives at the point of sale as well
as store fittings and furniture.  As sales
working budget expenses are channelspecific,  they are allocated to the Group's
operating segments.  In absolute termssales working budget expenditures
increased 28% to € 308 million in 2010
from € 241 million in the prior year. 
The Group's sales working budget
as a percentage of sales increased
03 percentage points to 26% in 2010
(2009: 23%),  primarily as a result of new
store openings to support the Group's
retail expansion see   19.  In additionhigher expenditure at the point of sale
in connection with the 2010 FIFA World
Cup as well as new product launches
at the Reebok brand contributed to this
development.

Marketing working budget grows
as a percentage of sales
Marketing working budget consists of
items such as expenses for promotion
partnerships,  advertising and public
relations to support brand strength.  As
marketing working budget expenses
are not distribution channel-specificthey are not allocated to the segments. 
In absolute terms,  marketing working
budget increased 25% to € 1288 billion
in 2010 from € 1028 billion in the prior
year.  The Group's marketing working
budget as a percentage of sales
increased 08 percentage points to 107%
in 2010 (2009: 99%) see   20.  This
was mainly due to higher expenditures
at brand adidas in order to leverage its
presence as official sponsor at the 2010
FIFA World Cup.  In addition,  increased
promotion and marketing initiatives for
new product concepts at the Reebok
brand impacted this development. 

Operating overhead expenses decrease
as a percentage of sales
Group operating overheads include
overhead costs related to marketingsales,  logistics,  research and development as well as central administration. 
Almost half of overhead expenses are
related to personnel costs.  In absolute
terms,  operating overhead expenses
were up 11% to € 3450 billion in 2010
versus € 3121 billion in 2009.  This was
primarily a result of the expansion of the
Group's own-retail activities,  as well as
an increase in logistic and warehouse
costs.  However,  due to increasing Retail
sophistication as well as operational
leverage,  operating overhead expenses
as a percentage of sales decreased
13 percentage points to 288% in 2010
from 301% in the prior year. 

Number of Group employees up 7%
At the end of December 2010,  the Group
employed 42541 people.  This represents
an increase of 7% versus the prior year
level of 39596.  New hirings related to
the expansion of the Group's own-retail
store base were the main driver of this
development.  On a full-time equivalent
basis,  the number of employees
increased 6% to 36444 at the end of 2010
(2009: 34437).

EBITDA grows 49%
The Group's earnings before interesttaxes,  depreciation and amortisation
as well as impairment/reversal of
impairment losses on property,  plant
and equipment and intangible assets
(EBITDA) increased 49% to € 1159 billion
in 2010 (2009: € 780 million) see 
 22.  Depreciation and amortisation
expense for tangible and intangible
assets with limited useful lives declined
12% to € 263 million in 2010 (2009:
€ 299 million).  This development was
mainly a result of lower impairment
charges in 2010 compared to the prior
year as well as the decrease in capital
expenditure in 2009.  In accordance with
IFRS,  intangible assets with indefinite
useful lives (goodwill and trademarks)
are tested annually and additionally
when there are indications of potential
impairment.  In this connection,  no
impairment of intangible assets with
unlimited useful lives was incurred in
2010 and 2009.

Operating margin improves
26 percentage points
Group operating profit increased 76%
to € 894 million versus € 508 million in
2009 see   23.  As a result,  the operating
margin of the adidas Group improved
26 percentage points to 75% in 2010
(2009: 49%) see   25.  The operating
margin improvement was primarily
due to the higher gross margin as well
as lower other operating expenses as
a percentage of sales. 
Financial income up 28%
Financial income increased 28% to
€ 25 million in 2010 from € 19 million in
the prior year,  mainly due to an increase
in interest income as well as positive
currency exchange rate effects. 

Financial expenses decrease 34%
Financial expenses decreased 34%
to € 113 million in 2010 (2009:
€ 169 million) see   26.  The
non-recurrence of prior year negative
currency exchange rate effects as well
as lower interest expenses contributed to
the decline. 
Income before taxes as a percentage of
sales increases 33 percentage points
Income before taxes (IBT) for the adidas
Group increased 125% to € 806 million
from € 358 million in 2009 see   27. 
IBT as a percentage of sales improved
33 percentage points to 67% in 2010
from 35% in 2009.  This was primarily a
result of the Group's operating margin
improvement and lower financial
expenses. 

Net income attributable to shareholders more than doubles
The Group's net income attributable to
shareholders increased to € 567 million
in 2010 from € 245 million in 2009
see   29.  This represents an increase
of 131% versus the prior year level. 
Higher IBT was the primary reason for
this development.  The Group's tax rate
decreased 20 percentage points to 295%
in 2010 (2009: 315%),  mainly due to the
non-recurrence of prior year charges
related to the write-down of deferred tax
assets.

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increases
Net income attributable to
non-controlling interests rose to
€ 1 million in 2010,  from € 0 million in
2009.  This increase was primarily due
to higher profits at our joint venture in
Israel. 
Earnings per share reach € 271
Following the full conversion of the
Group's convertible bond in the fourth
quarter of 2009,  the Group has no dilutive
potential shares anymore.  As a resultdiluted earnings per share equal basic
earnings per share.  In 2010,  basic and
diluted earnings per share amounted to
€ 271 see   31.  In the prior year periodbasic earnings per share amounted
to € 125 and diluted earnings per
share to € 122.  The weighted average
number of shares used in the calculation
was 209216186 in 2010.  In the prior
year period,  the number amounted to
196220166 for the calculation of basic
earnings per share and 209238099 for

Statement of Financial
Position and Statement
of Cash Flows
Changes in accounting policy
The Group's consolidated financial
statements are prepared in accordance
with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS as adopted by the EU). 
In 2010,  there were changes in IFRSwhich were reflected in the Group's
consolidation and accounting principles
see Note 1,  p.  188.  However,  the impact
on the Group's consolidated financial
statements from any such changes was
not material in the reporting period. 
Total assets increase 20%
At the end of December 2010,  total assets
grew 20% to € 10618 billion versus
€ 8875 billion in the prior year see 
 35.  This was primarily the result of an
increase in current assets.  An increase
in non-current assets also impacted this
development. 
Group inventories up 44%
Group inventories increased 44% to
€ 2119 billion at the end of December
2010 versus € 1471 billion in 2009 see
Note 8,  p.  197.  On a currency-neutral basisinventories grew 34%,  which reflects our
expectations for continued growth in the
coming quarters see   36. 

Accounts receivable increase 17%
At the end of December 2010Group receivables increased 17% to
€ 1667 billion (2009: € 1429 billion)
as a result of the Group sales growth
see Note 6,  p.  196.  On a currency-neutral
basis,  receivables were up 7%.  This
growth is lower than the 9% currencyneutral Group sales increase in the
fourth quarter of 2010 and mirrors strict
discipline in the Group's trade terms
management and concerted collection
efforts in all segments see   37. 

Assets held for sale decrease 63%
At the end of December 2010,  assets
held for sale declined 63% to € 47 million
compared to € 126 million in 2009.  This
decrease was due to the reclassification
of certain assets held for sale back to
fixed assets,  as it is not considered likely
that they will be sold in the foreseeable
future see Note 10,  p.  197.  Assets held for
sale primarily relate to the planned sale
of land and buildings in HerzogenaurachGermany,  as well as a warehouse in the
Netherlands. 

Other current financial assets up 23%
Other current financial assets grew 23%
to € 197 million at the end of December
2010 from € 160 million in 2009 see
Note 7,  p.  196.  This development was mainly
due to the increase in the fair value of
financial instruments. 

Fixed assets increase 7%
Fixed assets increased 7% to
€ 4076 billion at the end of December
2010 versus € 3794 billion in 2009. 
Fixed assets include property,  plant
and equipment,  goodwill,  trademarks
and other intangible assets as well as
long-term financial assets.  Additions
in an amount of € 271 million were
primarily related to the continued
expansion of our own-retail activitiesinvestments into the Group's IT
infrastructure as well as the further
development of the Group's headquarters
in Herzogenaurach.  A net transfer of fixed
assets from assets held for sale totalling
€ 76 million also contributed to the
increase.  Moreover,  currency translation
effects in an amount of € 216 million on
fixed assets denominated in currencies
other than the euro positively impacted
this development.  Additions were partly
offset by depreciation and amortisation
amounting to € 263 million as well as
disposals of € 17 million. 

Other current assets up 8%
Other current assets increased 8% to
€ 390 million at the end of December
2010 from € 360 million in 2009mainly as a result of an increase in tax
receivables other than income taxes
see Note 9,  p.  197.

to € 842 million at the end of 2010 from

2010 versus € 3771 billion in 2009  see 
 39.  The net income generated during
the period was the main contributor to
this development.  Currency translation
effects in an amount of € 330 million
positively impacted this developmentpartly offset by the dividend in an amount
of € 73 million paid during the period
see Note 25,  p.  204. 
Expenses related to
off-balance sheet items
Our most significant off-balance sheet
commitments are operating leaseswhich are related to retail stores,  officeswarehouses and equipment. 

142 

The Group has entered into various
operating leases as opposed to property
acquisitions to reduce exposure to
property value fluctuations.  Rent
expenses increased 13% to € 544 million
in 2010 from € 480 million in the prior
year,  mainly due to the continued
expansion of the adidas Group's
own-retail activities see Note 27,  p.  207. 

Cash flow reflects improved
Group profitability
In 2010,  net cash inflow from operating
activities was € 894 million (2009:
€ 1198 billion).  The decrease in cash
provided by operating activities compared
to the prior year was primarily due
to higher operating working capital
requirements,  partly offset by the
improved Group profitability.  Net cash
outflow from investing activities was
€ 330 million (2009: € 162 million). 
This was mainly related to spending for
property,  plant and equipment such as
investments in the furnishing and fitting
of stores in our Retail segment,  in new
office buildings and in IT systems,  as well
as to the purchase of short-term financial
assets.  Net cash outflow from financing
activities totalled € 238 million (2009:
€ 512 million). 

  Group Management Report Financial Review 

  Group Business Performance 

Cash outflows from financing activities
were related to the repayment of shortterm borrowings totalling € 198 million
and dividends paid in an amount of
€ 73 million,  partly offset by an increase
in long-term borrowings in an amount
of € 33 million.  Exchange rate effects
in an amount of € 55 million positively
impacted the Group's cash position in
2010 (2009: € 7 million).  As a result of
all these developments,  cash and cash
equivalents increased by € 381 million
to € 1156 billion at the end of December
2010 compared to € 775 million at the
end of December 2009  see   40. 

Capital expenditure grows 12%
Capital expenditure is the total
cash expenditure for the purchase
of tangible and intangible assets. 
Group capital expenditure increased
12% to € 269 million in 2010 (2009:
€ 240 million).  The Retail segment
accounted for 23% of Group capital
expenditure (2009: 30%).  Investments
primarily related to the expansion
of our store base for the adidas and
Reebok brands.  Expenditure in the
Wholesale segment accounted for 12%
of total capital expenditure (2009: 10%). 
Capital expenditure in Other Businesses
accounted for 10% of total expenditure
(2009: 6%).  The remaining 55% of Group
capital expenditure was recorded in
HQ/Consolidation (2009: 54%) and was
mainly related to investments into new
office buildings and IT infrastructure

Composition of subscribed capital
The nominal capital of adidas AG
amounts to € 209216186 (as at
December 31,  2010) and is divided
into the same number of registered
no-par-value shares with a pro-rata
amount in the nominal capital of € 1
each ('shares") see Note 25,  p.  204. 
Pursuant to § 4 section 8 of the Articles
of Association,  shareholders' claims
to the issuance of individual share
certificates are in principle excluded. 
Each share grants one vote at the Annual
General Meeting.  All shares carry the
same rights and obligations. 
In the USA,  we have issued American
Depositary Receipts (ADRs).  ADRs are
deposit certificates of non-US shares that
are traded instead of the original shares
on US stock exchanges.  Two ADRs equal
one share. 
Restrictions on voting rights
or transfer of shares
We are not aware of any contractual
agreements with the company or other
agreements restricting voting rights
or the transfer of shares.  Based on the
Code of Conduct of adidas AG,  howeverparticular lock-up periods do exist for
members of the Executive Board with
regard to the purchase and sale of adidas
AG shares.  These lock-up periods are
connected with the publication of our
quarterly and full year results.  Such
lock-up periods also exist for employees
who have access to yet unpublished
financial results. 

In addition,  restrictions of voting rights
pursuant,  inter alia,  to § 136 German
Stock Corporation Act (Aktien­ esetz –

AktG) or for treasury shares pursuant to
§ 71b AktG may exist. 

Shareholdings in share capital
exceeding 10% of voting rights
adidas AG has not been notified of,  and
is not aware of,  any direct or indirect
shareholdings in the share capital of
adidas AG exceeding 10% of the voting
rights. 
Shares with special rights
There are no shares bearing special
rights,  in particular there are no shares
with rights conferring powers of control. 
Voting right control if employees
have a share in the capital
Like all other shareholders,  employees
who hold adidas AG shares exercise their
control rights directly in accordance with
statutory provisions and the Articles of
Association. 

Executive Board appointment
and dismissal
Pursuant to § 6 of the Articles of
Association and § 84 AktG,  the
Supervisory Board is responsible for
determining the number of members
of the Executive Board,  for their
appointment and dismissal as well as for
the appointment of the Chief Executive
Officer (CEO).  Currently,  the adidas
AG Executive Board comprises the
CEO as well as three further members
see Executive Board,  p.  16.  Executive
Board members may be appointed for
 maximum period of five years.  Such
appointments may be renewed and the
terms of office may be extended,  provided
that no term exceeds five years. 
The Supervisory Board may revoke
the appointment of an individual as
member of the Executive Board or
Chief Executive Officer for good causesuch as gross negligence of duties
or a withdrawal of confidence by the
Annual General Meeting.  As adidas
AG is subject to the regulations of
the German Co-Determination Act
(Mitbestimmungsgesetz MitbestG)the appointment of Executive Board
members and also their dismissal
requires a majority of at least two thirds
of the Supervisory Board members
(§ 31 MitbestG).  If such a majority is
not established in the first vote by the
Supervisory Board,  upon proposal of the
Mediation Committee,  the appointment
or dismissal may be made in a second
vote with a simple majority of the votes
cast by the Supervisory Board members. 

Group Management Report Financial Review 

  Group Business Performance 

Should the required majority not be
established in this case either,  a third
vote,  again requiring a simple majoritymust be held in which,  however,  the
Chairman of the Supervisory Board
has two votes.  Furthermore,  the Fuerth
local court shall,  pursuant to § 85
section 1 AktG,  in urgent cases,  make the
necessary appointment upon application
by any party involved,  if the Executive
Board does not have the required number
of members. 

Amendments to the Articles
of Association
Pursuant to § 179 section 1 sentence 1
AktG,  the Articles of Association of adidas
AG can,  in principle,  only be amended
by a resolution passed by the Annual
General Meeting.  Pursuant to § 21
section 3 of the Articles of Association
in conjunction with § 179 section 2
sentence 2 AktG,  the Annual General
Meeting of adidas AG principally resolves
upon amendments to the Articles of
Association with a simple majority of the
votes cast and with a simple majority of
the nominal capital represented when
passing the resolution.  If mandatory legal
provisions stipulate a larger majority of
voting rights or capital,  this is applicable. 
When it comes to amendments solely
relating to the wording,  the Supervisory
Board is,  however,  authorised to make
these modifications in accordance with
§ 179 section 1 sentence 2 AktG in
conjunction with § 10 section 1 of the
Articles of Association.

Authorisation of the Executive
Board to issue shares
The authorisations of our Executive
Board are regulated by §§ 76 et seq.  AktG
in conjunction with § 7 of the Articles
of Association.  The Executive Board is
responsible,  in particular,  for managing
the company and represents the company
judicially and extra-judicially. 
The authorisation of the Executive Board
to issue shares is regulated by § 4 of the
Articles of Association and by statutory
provisions. 
– Until June 21,  2012,  the Executive
Board is authorised to increase the
nominal capital,  subject to Supervisory
Board approval,  by issuing new shares
against contributions in kind once
or several times by no more than
€ 25000000 altogether (Authorised
Capital 2009/II). 
– Until June 21,  2014,  the Executive
Board is authorised to increase the
nominal capital,  subject to Supervisory
Board approval,  by issuing new shares
against contributions in cash once

Capital 2009/I). 
– Until July 12,  2015,  the Executive Board
is authorised to increase the nominal
capital,  subject to Supervisory Board
approval,  by issuing new shares against
contributions in cash once or several

Subject to Supervisory Board approvalshareholders' subscription rights may be
excluded in certain cases for each of the
above-mentioned authorisations see
Note 25,  p.  204. 
– Pursuant to the resolution of the
Annual General Meeting held on May 62010,  the Executive Board is authorisedsubject to Supervisory Board approvalto issue bonds with warrants and/or
convertible bonds by the company or
affiliated companies once or several
times in the total amount of up to
€ 15 billion,  with or without a limited
term,  against contributions in cash and

by affiliated companies until May 5,  2015. 
Furthermore,  the Executive Board is
authorised,  subject to Supervisory Board
approval,  to grant to bondholders or bond
creditors subscription or conversion
rights relating to no more than a total
of 36000000 shares in compliance with
the corresponding conditions of the
bonds.  For this purpose,  the nominal
capital was conditionally increased by
up to € 36000000 (Contingent Capital
2010).  The Executive Board is authorisedsubject to Supervisory Board approvalto exclude shareholders' subscription
rights for fractional amounts and also
insofar as this is necessary for granting
subscription rights to which holders or
creditors of bonds already issued before
are entitled. 

  Group Management Report Financial Review 

  Group Business Performance 

Furthermore,  the Executive Board is
authorised,  subject to Supervisory Board
approval,  to also exclude shareholders'
subscription rights if the issue price of
the bonds is not significantly below the
market value of these bonds and the
number of shares to be issued does
not exceed 10% of the nominal capital. 
The issuance of new shares or the use
of treasury shares must be taken into
account when calculating the limit
of 10% in certain specific cases.  This
authorisation has not been utilised so far. 

Authorisation of the Executive
Board to cancel shares
The authorisations to repurchase adidas
AG shares arise from §§ 71 et seq.  AktG
and,  as at the balance sheet date,  from
the authorisation granted by the Annual
General Meeting on May 6,  2010. 
– Until May 5,  2015,  the Executive Board
is authorised to repurchase adidas AG
shares of up to an amount totalling 10%
of the nominal capital at the date of the
resolution (or,  as the case may be,  a
lower amount of nominal capital at the
date of utilisation of the authorisation) for
any lawful purpose and within the legal
frame.  The authorisation may be used by
the company but also by its subsidiaries
or by third parties on account of the
company or its subsidiaries or third
parties assigned by the company or one
of its subsidiaries. 
The repurchase will be carried out
via the stock exchange through a public
repurchase offer,  through a public
invitation to submit sale offers or through
granting tender rights to shareholders. 
Furthermore,  the authorisation sets out
the lowest and highest nominal value that
may be granted in each case. 

  Disclosures pursuant to § 315 Section 4 of the German Commercial Code 
The adidas AG shares repurchased based
on this authorisation may in particular be
used as follows:
–  hey may be sold via the stock

exchange,  through a public
share purchase offer made to all
shareholders or sold otherwise against
cash (limited to 10% of the nominal
capital taking into account certain
offsets) at a price not significantly
below the stock market price of shares
with the same features. 
–  hey may be offered and assigned

as consideration for the direct or
indirect acquisition of companiesparts of companies or participations
in companies or within the scope of
company mergers. 
–  hey may be offered and sold as

consideration for the acquisition of
industrial property rights or intangible
property rights or for the acquisition
of licences relating to such rights,  also
through subsidiaries. 
–  hey may be used for purposes of

meeting the subscription or conversion
rights or obligations or the company's
right to delivery of shares arising from
bonds with warrants and/or convertible
bonds issued by the company or a direct
or indirect subsidiary of the company
in accordance with an authorisation
granted by the Annual General Meeting. 
–  hey may be cancelled without the

cancellation or the execution thereof
requiring an additional resolution of the
Annual General Meeting. 

Furthermore,  the shares may be
assigned to members of the Executive
Board as compensation by way of a stock
bonus subject to the provision that resale
by the Executive Board members shall
only be permitted following a retention
period of at least three years from the
date of assignment.  Responsibility in this
case lies with the Supervisory Board. 
In case of utilisation of shares for the
above-mentioned purposes,  except for
the cancellation of shares,  shareholders'
subscription rights are excluded. 
The Supervisory Board may provide that
transactions based on this author­sation

may only be carried out subject to the
approval of the Supervisory Board or one
of its committees. 

– In the scope of the authorisation
resolved by the Annual General Meeting
on May 6,  2010,  the Executive Board
is furthermore authorised to conduct
the share buyback also by using equity
derivatives which are arranged with a
financial institution in close conformity
with market conditions.  adidas AG may
acquire call options issued for physical
delivery and/or sell put options or use
 combination of call and put options
or other equity derivatives if the option
conditions ensure that these shares are
only delivered if they were purchased
in compliance with the equality
principle.  All share purchases using the
aforementioned equity derivatives are
limited to a maximum value of 5% of
the nominal capital existing at the date
on which the resolution was adopted by
the Annual General Meeting (or,  as the
case may be,  a lower amount of nominal
capital at the date of utilisation of the
authorisation).  The term of the options
may not exceed 18 months and must
furthermore be chosen in such a way that
the shares are acquired upon the exercise
of the options no later than May 5,  2015.

the lowest and highest nominal value that
may be granted in each case.

Treasury
Group financing policy
The major goal of our financing policy
is to minimise the Group's financial
expenses while ensuring sufficient
liquidity reserves at all times to meet
the Group's payment commitments. 
The operating activities of our Group
segments and the resulting cash inflows
represent the Group's main source
of liquidity.  Liquidity is planned on a
rolling monthly basis under a multiyear financial and liquidity plan.  This
comprises all consolidated Group
companies.  Our in-house bank concept
takes advantage of the surplus funds of
individual Group companies to cover the
financial requirements of others,  thus
reducing external financing needs and
optimising our net interest expenses. 
By settling intercompany transactions
via intercompany financial accounts,  we
are able to reduce external bank account
transactions and thus bank charges. 
Effective management of our currency
exposure and interest rate risks are
additional goals of our Group Treasury
department. 

Treasury system and responsibilities
Our Group's Treasury Policy governs
all treasury-related issues,  including
banking policy and approval of
bank relationships,  global financing
arrangements and liquidity/asset
management,  currency and interest
risk management as well as the
management of intercompany cash flows. 
Responsibilities are arranged in a threetiered approach:
–  he Treasury Committee consists of

members of the Executive Board and
other senior executives who decide on
the Group's Treasury Policy and provide
strategic guidance for managing
treasury-related topics.  The Treasury
Committee approves all major changes
to our Treasury Policy. 
–  he Group Treasury department is

responsible for specific centralised
treasury transactions and for the global
implementation of our Group's Treasury
Policy. 
–  n a subsidiary level,  local managing

directors and financial controllers are
responsible for managing treasury
matters in the respective subsidiaries. 
Controlling functions on a Group
level ensure that the transactions of
the individual business units are in
compliance with the Group's Treasury
Policy. 

Centralised treasury function
In accordance with our Group's Treasury
Policy,  all worldwide credit lines are
directly or indirectly managed by the
Group Treasury department.  Portions of
those lines are allocated to the Group's
subsidiaries and backed by parental
guarantees.  As a result of this centralised
liquidity management,  the Group is
well positioned to allocate resources
efficiently throughout the organisation. 
The Group's debt is generally unsecured
and may include standard financial
covenants,  which are reviewed on a
quarterly basis.  We maintain good
relations with numerous partner banksthereby avoiding a high dependency on
any single institution.  Banking partners
of the Group and our subsidiaries
are required to have at least a BBB+
long-term investment grade rating by
Standard & Poor's or an equivalent rating
by another leading rating agency.  Only in
exceptional cases are Group companies
authorised to work with banks with a
lower rating see Risk and Opportunity
Report,  p.  158.  To ensure optimal allocation
of the Group's liquid financial resourcessubsidiaries transfer excess cash to the
Group's headquarters in all instances
where it is legally and economically
feasible.

Financial flexibility ensured
The adidas Group's financial flexibility is
ensured by unutilised credit facilities in
an amount of € 3934 billion at the end
of 2010 (2009: € 4135 billion).  These
include a € 1860 billion committed
multi-year syndicated loan which was not
utilised at year-end (2009: € 2000 billion
unutilised) as well as bilateral credit
lines at different banks in an amount of
€ 2074 billion (2009: € 2135 billion).  We
monitor the ongoing need for available
credit lines based on the current level
of debt as well as future financing
requirements. 
Short-term credit lines decrease
Short-term credit lines declined 3%
to € 2169 billion at the end of 2010
from € 2238 billion in the prior year. 
Credit lines decreased in line with
lower financing needs and growing cash
surpluses.  Committed and uncommitted
credit lines represent approximately
30% and 70% of total short-term credit
lines,  respectively (2009: 37% and 63%)
see   45. 

Standard financial covenants
In the case of our committed credit
facilities,  we have entered into various
covenants.  These covenants may include
limits on the disposal of fixed assetsthe amount of debt secured by lienscross default provisions and change of
control.  In addition,  certain financial
arrangements contain equity ratio
covenants,  minimum equity covenants
as well as net loss covenants.  If we
failed to meet any covenant and were
unable to obtain a waiver from a majority
of partner banks,  borrowings would
become due and payable immediately. 
As at December 31,  2010,  we were in full
compliance with all of our covenantswith ample coverage above all stipulated
minimum requirements.  As a result
of our cash flow expectations,  we
are confident we will continue to be
compliant with these covenants going
forward see Subsequent Events and Outlookp.  174.  We currently believe that cash
generated by operations,  together with
access to external sources of funds,  will
be sufficient to meet our future operating
and capital needs. 

Gross borrowings decrease
Gross borrowings decreased 9% to
€ 1610 billion at the end of 2010 from
€ 1767 billion in the prior year.  Bank
borrowings declined 8% to € 95 million
from € 103 million in the prior year.  Our
private placements in the USA,  Europe
and Asia decreased 13% to € 1017 billion
in 2010 (2009: € 1166 billion).  Bonds
outstanding remained stable and
amounted to € 498 million (2009:
€ 498 million) see   43.  No commercial
paper was outstanding at the end of 2010
(2009: € 0 million). 
Euro dominates currency mix
The majority of our Group's gross
borrowings are denominated in euros
and US dollars.  At the end of 2010gross borrowings denominated in
euros accounted for 55% of total gross
borrowings (2009: 61%).  The share of
gross borrowings held in US dollars
increased to 40% (2009: 33%) see   46.

Stable debt maturity profile
Over the course of 2010,  the Group's
financing maturity profile remained
stable with the term structure of debt
evenly spread see   53.  At the end of
2010,  total refinancing needs in the next
12 months amounted to € 273 million
(2009: € 198 million). 

Interest rate slightly improved
The weighted average interest rate on
the Group's gross borrowings improved
slightly to 51% in 2010 (2009: 52%)
see   49.  Positive effects from lower
interest rates on short-term borrowings
were partly offset by the higher share of
longer-term borrowings in the Group's
financing mix,  which carry a higher
average interest rate.  Long-term fixedrate financing amounted to 76% of the
Group's total financing at the end of 2010
(2009: 68%).  Variable financing amounted
to 24% of total financing at the end of the
year (2009: 32%). 

Net debt position decreases
by € 696 million
Net borrowings at December 31,  2010
amounted to € 221 million,  which
represents a decrease of € 696 millionor 76%,  versus € 917 million in the
prior year see   47.  This development
was fully in line with our original target
of net debt to be below the prior year
level communicated at the beginning
of 2010.  Strong operating cash flow
and lower capital expenditure than
originally planned positively influenced
this development.  Currency effects had
 positive impact of € 43 million on net
borrowings development.  On a net debt
basis,  the utilisation of credit facilities
available to the Group at the end of 2010
was 4% versus 16% in the prior year. 
The Group's financial leverage declined
to 48% at the end of 2010 versus 243%
in the prior year see   51.  At the end
of 2010,  the ratio of net borrowings
over EBITDA was 02 (ratio in 2009:
12) and thus well within the Group's
medium-term guideline of less than
two times.  Efficient management of our
capital structure continues to be a top
management priority see Subsequent
Events and Outlook,  p.  174.

Currency management a key priority
Due to the Group's global activitiescurrency management is a key focus
of the Group's Treasury department. 
Hedging US dollars is a central part of
our programme.  This is a direct result
of our Asian-dominated sourcing,  which
is largely denominated in US dollars
see Global Operations,  p.  106.  In 2010,  the
Group Treasury department managed
 net deficit of around US $ 21 billion
against the euro (2009: US $ 19 billion). 
As governed by our Group's Treasury
Policy,  we have established a rolling
12- to 24-month hedging system,  under
which the vast majority of the anticipated
seasonal hedging volume is secured six
months prior to the start of a season. 
As a result,  we have almost completed
our anticipated hedging needs for 2011
and we have already started hedging our
exposure for 2012.  The rates for 2011
are slightly less favourable compared to
those of 2010.  The use or combination of
different hedging instruments,  such as
forward contracts,  currency options and
swaps,  protects us against unfavourable
currency movements,  while retaining
the potential to benefit from future
favourable exchange rate developments
see Risk and Opportunity Report,  p.  158.

adidas Sport Style sales grow 21% on a
currency-neutral basis
Currency-neutral adidas Sport Style
wholesale revenues grew 21% in 2010. 
This increase was driven by strong
momentum in all categories,  particularly
adidas Originals and the adidas NEO
label.  Currency translation effects
positively impacted revenues in euro
terms.  adidas Sport Style sales grew
27% to € 1559 billion in 2010 (2009:
€ 1225 billion). 
Reebok sales grow 12% on
 currency-neutral basis
In 2010,  Reebok wholesale revenues
increased 12% on a currency-neutral

sales growth in the walking and running
categories due to the toning and ZigTech
platforms as well as growth in trainingwhich more than offset declines in other
categories.  In euro terms,  Reebok sales
improved 19% to € 1505 billion in 2010
from € 1265 billion in 2009.

unfavourable regional mix
Wholesale gross margin decreased
03 percentage points to 413% in 2010
from 416% in 2009 see   01.  Lower
input costs as well as less clearance
sales were more than offset by an
unfavourable regional mix related to
 higher portion of sales from lowermargin countries.  The adidas brand
wholesale gross margin decreased
07 percentage points to 437% in
2010 (2009: 444%).  The wholesale
gross margin of the Reebok brand

Segmental operating expenses as
a percentage of sales up 10 percentage
points
Segmental operating expenses in
Wholesale primarily relate to sales
working budget expenses as well
as expenditures for sales forceadministration and logistics.  In euro
terms,  segmental operating expenses
grew 27% to € 807 million in 2010
from € 636 million in 2009.  Segmental
operating expenses as a percentage of
sales increased 10 percentage points to
99% (2009: 89%).  This was primarily due
to higher warehousing and distribution
costs.  Expenditures in conjunction with
the 2010 FIFA World Cup as well as
Reebok's growth strategy also had a
minor impact. 

152 

Segmental operating profit
increases 10%
Segmental operating profit improved
10% to € 2572 billion in 2010 versus
€ 2342 billion in the prior year.  In 2010segmental operating margin decreased
12 percentage points to 314% (2009:
327%) see   01.  This was the result
of the gross margin decline as well as
higher segmental operating expenses as
a percentage of sales. 
Number of Wholesale
employees decreases
At year-end 2010,  the Group employed
4329 people in the Wholesale segmentwhich represents a decrease of 8%
versus 4723 employees in the previous
year.  This development is mainly due to
reorganisation measures following the
implementation of the joint operating
model in 2009.  On a full-time equivalent
basis,  the Wholesale segment employed
4158 people at year-end 2010.  This
represents a decrease of 8% versus the
prior year-end level of 4511.

in 2010 from € 1142 billion in 2009.

32 percentage points
Gross margin in the Retail segment
increased 32 percentage points to
618% in 2010 from 586% in 2009,  with
improvements in all store formats. 
This was mainly a result of a higher
proportion of concept store sales at
higher margins.  Gross margin was also
positively impacted by the appreciation
of the Russian rouble.  By brand,  the
adidas gross margin grew 24 percentage
points to 632% (2009: 609%) and
Reebok's gross margin improved
67 percentage points to 548% (2009:

€ 1116 billion in 2009  see   08. 
Segmental operating expenses
as a percentage of sales down
21 percentage points

primarily relate to personnel and rent
expenses as well as the sales working
budget.  Segmental operating expenses
increased 19% to € 1024 billion in
2010 from € 857 million in 2009.  This
was a result of higher sales working
budget expenses and higher expenses
related to the expansion of the Group's
store base,  particularly in emerging
markets.  Segmental operating expenses
as a percentage of sales declined
21 percentage points to 429% (2009:
450%),  as a result of operating leverage
in the segment. 

Segmental operating profit up 74%
Segmental operating profit increased
74% to € 452 million in 2010 versus
€ 259 million in the prior year. 
Segmental operating margin improved
53 percentage points to 189% (2009:
136%)  see   08.  This was a result of
the gross margin increase and lower
segmental operating expenses as
a percentage of sales. 
Retail employee base grows
On December 31,  2010,  the Group
employed 22286 people in the Retail
segment.  This represents an increase
of 14% versus 19576 employees at the
end of the prior year.  The increase in
the number of employees relates to the
expansion of the Group's store base. 
The majority of employees in Retail are
employed on a part-time basis.  On a
full-time equivalent basis,  the number of
people employed in Retail grew 12% to
17017 at the end of 2010 (2009: 15229).

In euro terms,  sales grew 10% to
€ 1420 billion (2009: € 1293 billion). 
Gross margin increased 42 percentage
points to 435% (2009: 393%).  This
was mainly a result of improving
product margins and a reduction
in clearance sales in the Rockport
segment.  Gross profit improved 21% to
€ 618 million in 2010 from € 509 million
in 2009.  As a result of the increase in
gross margin and stable segmental
operating expenses as a percentage
of sales,  segmental operating margin
increased 41 percentage points to
260% (2009: 219%).  In absolute
terms,  segmental operating profit grew
30% to € 369 million in 2010 versus
€ 283 million in 2009. 

Currency-neutral sales of
Other Businesses up 2%
In 2010,  revenues for Other Businesses
increased 2% on a currency-neutral
basis,  with sales growth in all segments. 
Currency translation effects positively
impacted revenues in euro terms. 
Sales of Other Businesses grew
10% to € 1420 billion in 2010 (2009:
€ 1293 billion) see   16. 
Currency-neutral sales of Other
Businesses grow in all regions
Currency-neutral sales of Other
Businesses increased in all regions. 
Revenues in Western Europe were up
1% on a currency-neutral basis due to
sales growth at TaylorMade-adidas Golf
and Reebok-CCM Hockey,  partly offset by
declines at Rockport.  Sales in European
Emerging Markets increased 8% on a
currency-neutral basis,  primarily driven
by higher Rockport and Reebok-CCM
Hockey sales.  Currency-neutral sales in
North America were stable.  Revenues
in Greater China were up 12% on a
currency-neutral basis as a result of
higher TaylorMade-adidas Golf sales. 
Sales in Other Asian Markets grew 3%
on a currency-neutral basis,  driven by
increases at Rockport.  In Latin Americacurrency-neutral sales grew 10% due to
increases at TaylorMade-adidas Golf and
Rockport.  Currency translation effects
had a positive impact on regional sales in
euro terms see   20. 

Currency-neutral TaylorMadeadidas Golf sales increase 1%
In 2010,  TaylorMade-adidas Golf
revenues increased 1% on a currencyneutral basis.  Growth was driven by
revenue increases in balls and ironswith products such as the Penta TP ball
and the Burner irons contributing to this
expansion.  Sales for adidas Golf also
increased,  driven by both footwear and
apparel.  Ashworth's revenues declined
due to the non-recurrence of prior year
sales related to a licensing agreement
that was discontinued and product
clearance sales in 2009 to align the
brand with its new positioning.  Currency
translation effects positively impacted
sales in euro terms.  In 2010,  TaylorMadeadidas Golf revenues increased 9% to
€ 909 million from € 831 million in the
prior year. 
Currency-neutral Rockport
sales grow 2%
In 2010,  Rockport revenues increased 2%
on a currency-neutral basis.  Growth in
the footwear category more than offset
 decline in accessories and apparel. 
Regionally,  Rockport's revenues grew
significantly in Other Asian Marketsparticularly in Japan and South Koreamore than offsetting declines in North
America.  Currency translation effects
positively impacted sales in euro terms. 
Revenues in the Rockport segment
increased 9% to € 252 million in 2010
from € 232 million in 2009.

Reebok-CCM Hockey sales up 3%
on a currency-neutral basis
Currency-neutral Reebok-CCM Hockey
sales grew 3% in 2010.  This development
was driven by increases in hardware
supported by new product introductions
such as the Reebok 11K and CCM
U+ Crazy Light skates.  RegionallyReebok-CCM Hockey sales grew at a
mid-single-digit rate in Scandinavia
and at a low-single-digit rate in North
America.  Currency translation effects
positively impacted sales in euro terms. 
Reebok-CCM Hockey revenues increased
13% to € 200 million in 2010 from

Gross margin of Other Businesses
improves 42 percentage points
Gross margin of Other Businesses
increased 42 percentage points to 435%
in 2010 from 393% in 2009.  This was
mainly due to a strong gross margin
improvement at TaylorMade-adidas Golf
as a result of improving product margins. 
In addition,  the Rockport gross margin
increased significantly versus the prior
year due to a lower portion of clearance
sales.  In absolute terms,  gross profit
increased 21% to € 618 million in 2010
versus € 509 million in 2009  see   16.

Risk and Opportunity Report
The adidas Group continuously explores and develops opportunities to sustain earnings and drive long-term increases in
shareholder value.  In doing so,  we acknowledge that it is necessary to take certain risks to maximise business opportunities. 
Our risk and opportunity management principles and system provide the framework for our Group to conduct business in a
well-controlled environment. 

Risk and opportunity management
review 2010
As a result of the recent financial and
economic crisis,  investor and financial
market expectations with regard to
transparent and comprehensive risk
and opportunity communication have
intensified.  In 2010,  we therefore
reviewed our risk processes and systems
in order to enhance our Group-wide risk
and opportunity management approachto increase internal awareness,  as well
as to improve internal and external
reporting where necessary.  The task
of operating and evolving the system
has been delegated to the Group Risk
Management function,  which is the
owner of the centrally managed risk
and opportunity management process. 
The central Group Risk Management
function has defined a network of senior
management representatives,  so-called
Risk Owners,  which include all direct
reports to the adidas AG Executive Board
and the managing directors of all our
markets.  As part of their regular dutiesRisk Owners are obliged to manage and
monitor risks and opportunities within
their area of responsibility. 

158 

In the course of this process,  we have
developed and implemented an updated
Group Risk Management Policy.  This
policy,  which is available to all Group
employees online,  outlines the principlesprocesses,  tools,  risk areas and key
responsibilities within our Group.  It also
defines reporting requirements and
communication timelines. 

Risk and opportunity management
principles
The adidas Group is regularly confronted
with risks and opportunities which have
the potential to negatively or positively
impact the Group's asset value,  earningscash flow strength,  or intangible values
such as brand image. 
We define risk as the potential
financial impact caused by the
occurrence of an external or internal
event (or series of events) that may
negatively impact our ability to achieve
the Group's business objectives. 
Opportunity is defined as the potential
financial impact caused by an external
or internal event (or series of events)
that can positively impact the Group's
business objectives. 
We have summarised the most
important of these risks and opportun­
ities in this Risk and Opportunity Report
in three main categories: Strategic and
Operational,  Compliance-related and
Financial. 

  Group Management Report Financial Review 

  Risk and Opportunity Report 
Risk and opportunity management
system
The adidas AG Executive Board has
the overall responsibility to operate
an effective risk and opportunity
management system that ensures
comprehensive and consistent
management of all significant risks and
opportunities.  The adidas AG Supervisory
Board has the responsibility to monitor
the effectiveness of the Group's risk
management system.  These duties are
undertaken by the Supervisory Board's
Audit Committee.  In addition,  wherever
relevant,  our Global Internal Audit
department also includes an assessment
of Risk Owners' compliance with the
Group Risk Management Policy within
the scope of their audit,  as part of their
regular auditing activities. 
To facilitate effective risk and
opportunity management,  we have
an integrated risk and opportunity
management system in place,  which
focuses on the identification,  evaluationhandling,  monitoring and reporting of
risks and opportunities.  The key objective
of this system is to protect and further
grow shareholder value through an
opportunity-focused,  but risk-aware
decision-making framework.

Evaluation 
Identification 
We believe that a key component
of optimal risk and opportunity
management is the identification and
evaluation of risks,  risk-mitigating
actions and opportunities where they
arise.  In addition,  a concerted approach
to handling,  monitoring and reporting is
of key importance.  Therefore,  risk and
opportunity management is a Group-wide
activity which utilises critical day-to-day
management insight from local business
units. 
The main components of our risk and
opportunity management process are:
Risk and opportunity identification: The
adidas Group continuously monitors
the macroeconomic environmentdevelopments in the sporting goods
industry,  as well as internal processes
to identify risks and opportunities as
early as possible.  The Risk Owners
have primary responsibility for the
identification of risks and opportunities. 
The central Group Risk Management
function has defined a catalogue of
potential risks (Risk Universe) to
assist and facilitate the Risk Owners in
identifying and categorising risks and
opportunities.  On the one hand,  the
respective Risk Owners actively monitor
the potential financial impact from
changes in the overall macroeconomicpolitical and social landscape.  On the
other hand,  they closely observe branddistribution channel and price point
developments. 

 key element of the identification
process is primary qualitative and
quantitative research such as trend
scouting,  consumer surveys as well as
feedback from our business partners and
controlled space network.  These efforts
are supported by global market research
and competitor analysis.  Through this
process we seek to identify the marketscategories,  consumer target groups and
product styles which show most potential
for future growth at a local and global
level.  Equally,  our analysis focuses on
those areas that are at risk of saturationor exposed to increased competition or
changing consumer tastes. 
Risk and opportunity evaluation: In order
to manage risks and opportunities in an
effective way,  we evaluate identified risks
and opportunities individually according
to a systematic evaluation methodologywhich is applied consistently and allows
adequate prioritisation as well as
allocation of resources.  According to our
risk management methodology,  a risk
and opportunity score is calculated by
multiplying the potential financial impact
with the likelihood of occurrence.  The
financial impact represents the biggest
possible potential effect on contributionwith contribution being defined as
operating profit before intra-Group
royalties. 

The financial impact is evaluated by
utilising five categories: MarginalMinor,  Moderate,  Significant and Major. 
Likelihood represents the possibility that
 given risk or opportunity may occur. 
The likelihood of individual risks and
opportunities is evaluated on a scale of
0% to 100%,  using five classifications to
represent an aggregate likelihood for
various risk and opportunity categories:
Unlikely,  Possible,  Likely,  Probable and
Highly Probable. 
As risks and opportunities have
different characteristics,  we have defined
separate methodologies for assessing
the potential financial impact.  For each
individual risk,  the gross risk score and
the net risk score have to be evaluated. 
While the gross risk score reflects the
worst-case negative financial impact
before any mitigating actions,  the net
risk score reflects the expected financial
impact after all mitigating actions.  This
approach on the one hand allows for a
good understanding of the impact of an
individual mitigating action taken,  and
on the other hand provides the basis for
scenario analysis and simulations.  In
addition,  the respective Risk Owners are
also required to assess each risk from a
timing perspective in order to determine
when the risk could materialise.  In
assessing the potential effect on
contribution from opportunities,  each
opportunity is appraised with respect to
viability,  commerciality,  potential risks
and the expected profit contribution. 

This approach is applied to longer-term
strategic prospects but also to shorterterm tactical and opportunistic initiatives
at both the Group and,  more extensivelythe brand and market level. 
Risk and opportunity handling: Risks and
opportunities are treated in accordance
with the Group's risk and opportunity
management principles as described
in the Group Risk Management Policy. 
Risk Owners are in charge of developing
and implementing appropriate riskmitigating actions and exploiting
opportunities within their area of
responsibility.  In addition,  the Risk
Owners need to determine a general
risk handling strategy for the identified
risks,  which is either risk avoidance,  risk
reduction with the objective to minimise
financial impact and/or likelihood of
occurrence,  risk transfer to a third party
or risk acceptance.  The decision on the
implementation of the respective risk
handling strategy also takes into account
the costs in relation to the effectiveness
of any planned mitigating actions if
applicable. 

Group Management Report Financial Review 

  Risk and Opportunity Report 

  159

Risk and opportunity monitoring and
reporting: Our integrated risk and opportunity management system aims to
increase the transparency of Group risks
and opportunities.  As both risks and
opportunities are subject to constant
change,  Risk Owners not only monitor
developments,  but also the adequacy
and effectiveness of the current risk
handling strategy on an ongoing basis. 
Risk reporting consists of two separate
regular reporting streams:
On the one hand,  Risk Owners
are required to report to Group Risk
Management gross risks with a possible
impact on contribution above the
threshold of € 50 million regardless of
their likelihood of materialising and
net risks with a possible impact over
€ 1 million on contribution and the
likelihood of materialising.  Material
changes in previously reported risks and/
or newly identified risks with a potential
net impact on contribution of more than
€ 5 million are reported on an ad-hoc
basis.  Opportunities are aggregated
separately with Risk Owners reporting all
opportunities with a net impact of above
€ 1 million on contribution. 
On the other hand,  Group Risk
Management provides the adidas AG
Executive Board with a quarterly report
based on the Risk Owners' input.  Any
issues identified that,  due to their
material nature,  require immediate
reporting to the Executive Board are
reported outside the regular reporting
stream on an ad-hoc basis. 

160 

Description of the main features of
the internal control and risk management system relating to the financial
reporting process pursuant to § 315
section 2 no.  5 German Commercial
Code (Handelsgesetzbuch HGB)
We regard the internal control and
risk management system relating to
the consolidated financial reporting
process of the adidas Group as a system
which is embedded within the Groupwide risk management system.  The
risk management system with respect
to the financial reporting process
aims at minimising the risk of false
representation in our Group accounting
and in external financial reporting. 
To this end,  Group-wide compliance
with statutory provisions and internal
Group regulations must be ensured.  We
regard the risk management system
as a process based on the principle of
segregation of duties,  encompassing
various sub-processes in the areas of
Accounting,  Controlling,  Taxes,  TreasuryPlanning,  Reporting and Legal,  focusing
on the identification,  assessmenttreatment,  monitoring and reporting of
financial reporting risks.  Clearly defined
responsibilities are assigned to each
distinct sub-process in the various areas. 
In a first step,  the risk management
system serves to identify and assess
as well as to limit and control risks
identified in the consolidated accounting
process which might result in our
consolidated financial statements not
being in conformity with regulations. 

  Group Management Report Financial Review 

  Risk and Opportunity Report 
The internal control system relating to
the financial accounting process serves
to provide reasonable assurance that
the financial statements are prepared
in compliance with regulations despite
identified financial reporting risks.  To
ensure the effectiveness of the internal
control and risk management systemthe Internal Audit function regularly
reviews accounting-relevant processes. 
Additionally,  as part of the year-end
audit,  the external auditor examines
selected aspects of the systemincluding the IT systems,  to assess their
effectiveness.  Even with appropriate and
functional systems,  however,  absolute
certainty cannot be guaranteed. 
adidas AG defines uniform
consolidated accounting policies and
updates these on a regular basisdependent on regulatory changes and
internal developments.  Clear regulations
serve to limit employees' scope of
discretion with regard to inclusion
and valuation of assets and liabilitiesthus reducing the risk of inconsistent
accounting practices within the Group. 
These policies are available to all
employees involved in the financial
accounting process through the Groupwide intranet.  Material changes are
communicated to the subsidiaries Groupwide on a quarterly basis.  We aim to
ensure compliance with the financial
accounting rules through continuous
adherence to the four-eyes principle in
accounting-related processes.  Certain
reporting obligations and the extent
thereof are mandatory for the Group's
subsidiaries.  Adherence to reporting
obligations and timelines is monitored
centrally by Group Accounting. 

Financial accounting at subsidiaries is
conducted either locally by the respective
company or by a Shared Service Centre
that provides this service for several
subsidiaries.  Most of the IT systems
used are based on SAP AFS.  Some Group
companies use Navision-based ERP
software that was developed in-house. 
The individual financial statements are
subsequently transferred into a central
consolidation system based on SAP
SEM-BCS.  The regularity and reliability
of the financial statements prepared by
subsidiaries is reviewed at Group level
by Group Accounting and Controlling.  If
necessary,  the Group seeks the opinion of
independent experts to review business
transactions that occur infrequently
and cannot be processed as a matter of
routine.  Controls within the consolidation
process such as those relating to
the consolidation of liabilities or of
revenues and expenses are conducted
both automatically (system-based) and
manually.  Any inadequacies are remedied
and reported back to the subsidiaries. 
All financial systems used are
protected against malpractice by means
of appropriate authorisation concepts
and access restrictions.  Access authorisations are reviewed on a regular basis
and updated if required.  The risk of data
loss or outage of financial-accountingrelated IT systems is minimised by Group
IT through central control and monitoring of virtually all IT systems,  centralised management of change processes
and with support through regular data
backups. 

Strategic and
operational risks
Macroeconomic risks
Growth in the sporting goods industry
is highly dependent on consumer
spending and consumer confidence. 
Abrupt economic downturns,  socio-­
political factors such as civil unrestnationalisation or expropriation,  in
particular in regions where the Group
is highly represented,  therefore pose
 significant short-term risk to sales
development.  To mitigate this risk,  the
Group strives to balance sales across
key global regions and also between
developed and emerging markets. 
In addition,  a core element of our
positioning in performance sports is the
utilisation of an extensive global event
and partnership portfolio where demand
is more predictable and less sensitive to
macroeconomic influences.  In 2011,  we
expect the global economy to grow,  albeit
with varying degrees of performance
geographically  see Subsequent Events and
Outlook,  p.  174.  As a result,  we assess the
likelihood that adverse macroeconomic
events could impact our business as
likely,  which is a reduction compared to
the prior year.  Nevertheless,  we continue
to regard the potential financial impact of
such events as significant. 

Consumer demand risks
Failure to anticipate and respond to
changes in consumer demand for
sporting goods products is one of the
most serious threats to our industry. 
Consumer demand changes can be
sudden and unexpected,  particularly in
our fashion-related businesses.  Because
industry product procurement cycles
average 12 to 18 months,  the Group faces
 risk of short-term revenue loss in cases
where it is unable to respond quickly
to such changes.  Even more criticalhowever,  is the risk of continuously overlooking a new consumer trend or failing
to acknowledge its potential magnitude
over a sustained period of time. 
To mitigate this risk,  identifying and
responding to shifts in consumer demand
as early as possible is a key responsibility
of our brands and in particular of the
respective Risk Owners.  Therefore,  we
utilise extensive primary and secondary
research tools as outlined in our risk and
opportunity identification process. 
As a leader in our industry,  our brand
strategies are focused on influencing
rather than reacting to the changing
consumer environment.  We invest
significant resources in research and
development to innovate and bring fresh
new technologies and designs to market
 see Research and Development,  p.  110.

We also seek to enhance consumer
demand for our brands through
extensive marketing,  product and brand
communication programmes.  And we
focus on supply chain improvements to
speed up creation-to-shelf timelines
 see Global Operations,  p.  106. 
Given the broad spectrum of our
Group's product offering,  retailer
feedback and other early indicators  see
Internal Group Management System,  p.  126,  we
view the risk from consumer demand
shifts as unchanged versus the prior
year.  We therefore rate the likelihood of
changes in consumer demand as likelyand the potential financial impact as
moderate. 

Industry consolidation risks
The adidas Group is exposed to risks
from market consolidation and strategic
alliances amongst competitors and/or
retailers.  This can result in a reduction
of our bargaining power,  or harmful
competitive behaviour such as price
wars.  Abnormal product discounting
and reduced shelf space allocation from
retailers are the most common potential
outcomes of these risks.  Sustained
promotional pressure in one of the
Group's key markets could threaten
the Group's sales and profitability
development. 

162 

To moderate this risk,  we are committed
to maintaining a regionally balanced
sales mix and continually adapting the
Group's distribution strategy with a
particular focus on controlled space
initiatives  see Global Sales Strategy,  p.  82. 
Although the market capitalisation of
many companies within the sporting
goods industry increased substantially
in 2010,  merger and acquisition activity
is forecasted to intensify in the light
of good credit market conditions as
well as improving corporate balance
sheets and business projections.  As
 result,  we continue to regard risks
from market consolidation as having a
probable likelihood of occurrence.  The
potential financial impact is assessed as
significant. 

Hazard risks
The adidas Group is exposed to external
risks such as natural disastersepidemics,  fire and accidents.  Physical
damage to our own or our suppliers'
premises,  production units,  warehouses
and stock in transit can lead to property
damage and business interruption. 
These risks are mitigated by loss prevention measures such as working with
reliable suppliers and logistics providers
who guarantee high safety standards.  In
addition to the insurance coverage we
have secured,  the Group has also implemented contingency plans to minimise
potential negative effects. 

  Group Management Report Financial Review 

  Risk and Opportunity Report 
We assess the potential occurrence of
hazard risks as unlikely.  In connection
with the adjustment of our risk methodology in 2010,  however,  we have changed
our assessment of the potential financial
impact.  Should those risks materialisewe now expect hazard risks to have a
major financial impact,  reflecting the
fundamental and devastating consequences natural disasters or terrorist
acts might have on our business on a
theoretical basis. 

Risks from loss of brand image
The adidas Group faces considerable
risk if we are unable to uphold high
levels of consumer awareness,  affiliation
and purchase intent for our brands.  In
addition,  if the Group's brands are not
allocating sufficient marketing resources
to activate our sports assets and brand
campaigns in a sustainable mannerwe face the risk of fading consumer
awareness and attractiveness.  To
mitigate these risks,  we have defined
clear mission statements,  values and
goals for all our brands.  These form the
foundation of our product and brand
communication strategies.  We also
continually refine our product offering to
meet shifts in consumer demand and to
contemporise our offering to respond to
current trends. 

Central to all our brand initiatives is
ensuring clear and consistent messaging
to our targeted consumer audience. 
Market share gains at TaylorMade as well

World Cup give us confidence that brand
image risks for these brands are unlikely. 
In addition,  the successful introduction of
new Reebok product initiatives such as
in the toning category and ZigTech has
helped to stimulate consumer interest
and improve Reebok's brand image. 
Aggregating these factors,  we
believe that the risk from loss of brand
image for the Group has only a possible
likelihood of occurrence.  Neverthelessa considerable deterioration in brand
image could have a significant financial
impact on our Group. 

Own-retail risks
New adidas,  Reebok and Rockport
own-retail stores require considerable
up-front investment in furniture and
fittings as well as ongoing maintenance. 
In addition,  own-retail activities often
require longer-term lease or rent
commitments.  Retail also employs
significantly more personnel in relation
to net sales than our wholesale business. 
The higher portion of fixed costs
compared to our wholesale business
implies a larger profitability impact in
cases of significant sales declines. 

The Group reduces this risk by only
entering into lease contracts with
durations of less than ten years. 
Store performance is measured by
 retail scorecard consisting of nine
quantitative key performance indicators. 
Underperforming stores are reorganisedremodelled or closed as appropriate. 
Our increased focus on improving our
sophistication as a retailer by investing
in management expertise as well as in IT
systems remains a key priority for 2011
 see Global Sales Strategy,  p.  82.  Despite
the projected improvement in the global
macroeconomic environment in 2011risks to consumer spending due to rising
inflation are high  see Economic and Sector
Development,  p.  130.  Therefore,  we view the
risk of underperformance of some of our
own-retail stores as likely.  The potential
financial impact from own-retail underperformance,  which may also involve
impairment charges and store closuresis moderate. 

Risks from rising input costs
Raw material and labour costs account
for approximately 70% of the Group's
cost of sales.  Prices of materials such
as rubber,  cotton,  polyester and those
which closely correlate with the oil price
are especially subject to the risk of
price changes.  As our ordering process
and price negotiations usually take
place around six months in advance of
production,  our sourcing function has
visibility and reaction time to plan for
sharp increases in input costs. 

To reduce the financial impact on our
product margins from higher sourcing
costs,  we are implementing further lean
manufacturing techniques at our partner
factories,  reducing time and cost in the
procurement process,  re-engineering
our products and selectively increasing
prices where possible.  In addition,  within
our end-to-end profitability initiativeswe have implemented a dedicated team
which is responsible for elaborating
mitigation measures against rising input
costs throughout the supply chain  see
Global Operations,  p.  106.  In the medium
term,  we also have the ability to adapt
our sourcing structure to take advantage
of more competitive pricing in other
locations. 
As a result of the considerable
turnaround in global economic activityraw material prices have increased
significantly compared to the prior
year.  This development is forecasted to
negatively impact our sourcing costs in
2011.  As we begin planning for 2012further increases cannot be ruled out. 
Therefore,  the risks from rising input
costs have increased significantly
compared to the end of 2009 and are now
assessed as having a highly probable
likelihood of occurrence and a major
potential financial impact. 

Supplier default risks
Over 95% of our product offering is
sourced through independent suppliersmainly located in Asia  see Global
Operations,  p.  106.  To reduce the risk
of business interruptions following a
potential supplier default,  we work with
vendors who demonstrate reliabilityquality,  innovation and continuous
improvement. 

In addition,  we have bought insurance
coverage for the risk of business interruptions caused by physical damage to
supplier premises. 
Therefore,  we assess supplier default
risks as having a possible likelihood of
occurrence and a moderate potential
financial impact. 

Inventory risks
As we place initial production orders
around six months in advance of
delivery,  the adidas Group is exposed to
inventory risks relating to misjudging
consumer demand at the time of
production planning.  A sudden decline
in demand has the potential to cause
excess inventories.  This can have
negative implications for our financial
performance,  including higher levels
of clearance activity and inventory
obsolescence as well as reduced liquidity
due to higher operating working capital
requirements. 
On the other hand,  a sudden increase
in demand can lead to product shortfalls at the point of sale.  In this situationour Group faces the risk of missed
sales opportunities and/or customer
and consumer disappointment,  which
could lead to a reduction in brand loyalty
and our reputation as an on-time,  in-full
supplier.  In addition,  the Group faces
potential profitability impacts from costs
such as air freight in efforts to speed up
replenishment. 

In order to mitigate these risks,  we
continuously strive to improve our forecasting and material planning processes. 
Our replenishment programmes are
another example of how we are striving
to shorten production lead timesensuring availability of products while
avoiding excess inventories  see Global
Operations,  p.  106. 
Although the expected overproportionate growth of the Retail
segment will increase the exposure
towards swings in consumer demandour demand and inventory planning
accuracy for 2011 will benefit from the
improved macroeconomic climate versus
2010.  Therefore,  the associated inventory
risks have decreased slightly and are now
assessed as having a possible likelihood
of occurrence and a moderate potential
financial impact on our Group. 

Customer risks
Customer risks arise from our dependence on key customers who have the
ability to exert bargaining power and can
therefore cause considerable margin
pressure or cancel orders.  These risks
exist not only due to the relative size
of some of our major customers,  but
also as a result of our limited ability to
influence how they conduct business.  In
addition,  over recent years,  several large
customers have been expanding their
own private brand and private label businesses,  which can negatively impact our
efforts to increase shelf space. 

Group Management Report Financial Review 

  Risk and Opportunity Report 

  163

To limit these risks,  we utilise a broad
distribution strategy which includes
expanding our controlled space
activities.  This enables us to reduce
negative consequences resulting from
sales shortfalls that can occur with
key customers.  Specifically,  no single
customer of our Group accounted for
more than 10% of Group sales in 2010. 
When necessary,  we also restrict or
limit the distribution of our products to
protect brand image or product margins. 
By differentiating our product offer to
customers,  we limit the risk of increased
price competition on specific products
which can result in margin erosion. 
Furthermore,  with our substantial
marketing efforts we are aiming at
building desirable brands which resonate
with the tastes of our consumers and
ultimately drive high sell-through rates
for our customers,  thus providing less
incentive for our customers to engage in
private label initiatives. 
In light of improving retailer trendswe believe the risk of a strong reduction
of business with one of our biggest
retailers is unlikely.  Nevertheless,  due
to increasing customer activity with
regard to private brand and private
label business,  we now believe that on
an aggregate level customer risks have
increased and have a highly probable
likelihood of occurrence on a continuous
basis.  The potential financial impact on
the Group is regarded as major. 

164 

Regulatory risks
Regulatory risks predominantly include
potential losses from significant changes
to trade policies.  In particular,  the adidas
Group faces risks arising from sudden
increases of import restrictions,  as well
as import tariffs and duties that could
compromise the free flow of goods
within the Group and from suppliers. 
For example,  several Latin American
countries have significant import duties
on footwear imports from China in placewhich negatively impacts our profitability
in these markets. 
To limit these risks,  we proactively
utilise a regionally diversified supplier
base which provides some protection
against unforeseen changes in regulations and also allows us to shift production to other countries at an early stage if
necessary  see Global Operations,  p.  106. 
As a result of the likelihood of rising
protectionist activity by governmentswe continue to regard further political
and regulatory actions as having a likely
potential of occurrence.  An unexpected
significant change in the political and
regulatory environment could have a
significant financial impact on the Group. 

  Group Management Report Financial Review 

  Risk and Opportunity Report 
Risks from loss of key event or
promotion partnerships
Event and promotion partnerships play
an important role in building brand
image and product authenticity with
our consumers,  and this ultimately
supports the generation of sales of
licensed products.  The adidas Group
faces the risk of either losing key partnerships or having to accept unfavourable terms due to intensified competition for attractive contracts.  To mitigate
these inherent risks,  we not only seek to
extend our most important partnership
agreements before contract expiry,  but
also to broaden the Group's portfolio of
premium partnerships to help our brands
to expand their consumer reach and
reduce our reliance on single affiliations. 
Two examples in 2010 were the extension
of the partnership between adidas and
the Mexican Football Federation and
Reebok's global alliance with Giorgio
Armani to create special collections. 
We also regularly include changeof-control clauses as well as non-cash
compensation components in contracts
to avoid the risk that negotiations are
reduced solely to price.  We expect a high
level of competition for top promotion
partnerships to continue in the near to
medium term as smaller competitors are
expected to intensify their spending in
this area. 

Given the maturity of our most important
contracts,  we believe the risk of losing
important individual promotion contracts
is only likely.  We assess the potential
financial impact of this risk to be
moderate in the medium term. 

Product design and development risks
Innovative and attractive products
generate strong sales and more
importantly create a halo effect for
other products.  Furthermore,  fulfilling
highest standards in terms of product
quality and safety is critical to sustainable
commercial success and forms an
integral part of the product design and
development phase.  The speed with
which new product technologies and
fresh designs are brought to market
is decisive for maintaining competitive
advantage.  In 2010,  all brands generated
the majority of their sales with products
which had been brought to market
over the previous 12 to 18 months
 see Research and Development,  p.  110.  If
the adidas Group failed to maintain a
pipeline of new innovative products over
 sustained period of time,  we would
risk a significant sales decline.  We focus
on pursuing our innovation and design
strength.  To ensure we can quickly adapt
to changing consumer preferenceswe focus on streamlining research and
development processes to speed up the
time to market. 

We continue to assess the likelihood of
occurrence of risks from product design
and development as possible.  Howevergiven the broad spectrum of the adidas
Group's product offering,  on an aggregate
level,  the potential financial impact has
decreased and is now regarded as minor. 

Personnel risks
Achieving the adidas Group's goal
of becoming the global leader in the
sporting goods industry is highly
dependent on our employees and their
talents.  The loss of key personnel in
strategic positions is therefore an obvious
risk we face.  We also face the risk of
being unable to identify,  recruit and
retain the most talented people who best
meet the specific needs of our Group. 
In addition,  a lack of sufficient training
measures might cause the dilution of
critical knowledge,  in particular within
the product design and development
area. 
To reduce this risk,  we strongly
engage in developing a motivating
working environment.  Our goal is to
make the adidas Group the 'Employer
of Choice" within our industry.  Attractive reward and incentive schemes are
designed to supplement long-term
career opportunities and planning  see
Employees,  p.  115. 

With the expansion of our own-retail
activities and the increase of our
employee base in emerging marketswe believe that employee turnover
will slightly increase in the future. 
Moreover,  labour markets are becoming
increasingly more competitive,  with the
battle for the most talented employees
constantly intensifying. 
Therefore,  the likelihood of
occurrence of personnel risks has
increased and is now assessed as likely. 
If they materialise,  these risks could
have a moderate financial impact on our
Group. 

IT risks
Key business processes including
product marketing,  order managementwarehouse management,  invoice
processing,  customer support and
financial reporting are all dependent
on IT systems.  A significant systems
outage or loss of data could result in
considerable disruptions to our business. 
Insufficient project management could
delay the execution of projects critical to
the Group or make them more expensive
than planned. 
To mitigate these risks,  our IT
organisation proactively engages
in system preventive maintenanceservice ­ ontinuity planning and

adherence to applicable IT policies.  Data
security is managed by restricting user
access based on job description and
adhering to data protection regulations. 

We perform multiple backups at alternating data centre locations for the
Group's core enterprise resource
planning system (ERP) on a daily basis. 
In addition,  for the ERP system,  our
contingency solution allows us to quickly
switch to a remote site if necessary –
without any loss of data.  System securitycontrols and reliability are reviewed and
tested by the Internal Audit function. 
IT project risks are further mitigated
by utilising a proven project methodology
for all IT projects that includes tight
cost control and regular risk reviews for
all major projects.  In addition to these
fundamental controls,  the adidas Group
continued to focus on additional IT control
initiatives in 2010.  The IT organisation's
strategic direction and five-year plan is
aligned with the adidas Group's overall
Route 2015 strategic business plan. 
New quality reviews for major projects
have been implemented to ensure that
the progress,  quality and costs of those
projects are regularly evaluated by
members of senior management.  FinallyIT-related processes and systems were
key components of the Group risk and
opportunity management review in 2010. 
Based on these factors,  we believe
the risk of a major IT default continues
to be unlikely.  Such a default,  howeverwould result in a significant potential
financial impact. 

Compliance-related risks
Legal risks
The adidas Group is exposed to the risk of
claims and litigation for infringement of
third-party trademark,  patent and other
rights.  To reduce this risk,  new product
technologies,  designs and names are
carefully researched to identify and avoid
potential conflicts with the rights of third
parties.  We have further strengthened
our Intellectual Property department
resources to drive enhancements in our
patent portfolio,  and in the reviewing and
analysis of third-party patents. 
Due to the safeguards in place and
given that we are not dependent on single
products or product groups,  we believe
that the likelihood that our Group might
infringe third-party trademark or patent
rights in a material way is only possible. 
Nevertheless,  we believe that litigation
could have a moderate financial impact
on our Group. 
Social and environmental risks
We have a continuing responsibility
to our employees,  suppliers and the
environment.  Malpractice in these areasin particular human rights violationsdubious employment practices as well
as environmentally harmful production
processes can have a significant impact
on the reputation and operational
efficiency of our Group and our suppliers. 
To limit this risk,  we have established
Workplace Standards to which suppliers
must conform before and during business
relationships with the Group  see
Sustainability,  p.  120.  Internal inspections of
supplier factories verified by extensive
independent audits are conducted
regularly. 

Group Management Report Financial Review 

  Risk and Opportunity Report 

  165

In the event of non-compliance with
these standards,  we develop joint action
plans and set deadlines for compliance
and further improvement.  If these
deadlines are not met,  business relations
are terminated  see Sustainability,  p.  120and  www, adidas-Group, com/sustainability. 
In order to minimise the
environmental impact of producing
and distributing our products,  in 2010
the adidas Group developed its first
fully comprehensive environmental
strategy (Environmental Strategy 2015). 
This strategy takes a holistic approach
towards environmental issues such as
sustainable resource use,  climate change
mitigation,  emissions to water and airwaste treatment as well as hazardous
substances.  Part of this strategy is also
to extend our 'Better Place" initiative
to more adidas athletic footwear and
apparel products  see Sustainability,  p.  120. 
We currently believe that social and
environmental malpractice may occur
only in isolated cases.  Therefore,  we
assess the likelihood of occurrence as
unlikely.  Nevertheless,  we believe thatgoing forward,  legislative measures as
well as consumer expectations with
regard to socially and environmentally
sound business practices and behaviour
will become more demanding,  which
will add to our corporate responsibility
obligations.  Due to this development
we will,  for example,  have to cope
with rising costs in order to fulfil more
challenging environmental requirements. 
As a consequence,  the likelihood of
occurrence and the potential financial
impact from social and environmental
risks have increased and are now
assessed as probable and moderaterespectively. 

166 

Risks from product counterfeiting
and imitation
As popular consumer brands which rely
on technological and design innovation
as defining characteristics,  the Group's
brands are frequent targets for counterfeiting and imitation.  To reduce the loss of
sales and the potential damage to brand
reputation resulting from counterfeit
products,  the adidas Group makes use
of extensive legal protection (generally
through registration) and works closely
with law enforcement authorities,  investigators and outside counsel.  Although
we have stepped up measures such
as product security labelling with our
authorised suppliers,  the development of
these measures remains a key priority
on an ongoing basis.  In 2010,  more than
12 million counterfeit adidas Group
products were seized worldwide. 
We continue to regard the likelihood
of counterfeiting and imitation as highly
probable.  However,  we believe we have
adequate costs budgeted to support
our ongoing efforts to successfully
combat counterfeiting and imitationwhich also include adding more local
brand protection officers.  Therefore,  we
assess the risk from counterfeiting and
imitation to potentially negatively impact
our forecasted financial contribution as
moderate. 
Product quality risks
The adidas Group faces a risk of selling
defective products,  which may result
in injury to consumers and/or image
impairment.  We mitigate this risk by
employing dedicated teams that monitor
the quality of our products on all levels
of the supply chain through rigorous
testing prior to production,  close
cooperation with suppliers throughout
the manufacturing process,  random 
  Group Management Report Financial Review 

  Risk and Opportunity Report 
testing after retail delivery,  open
communication about defective products
and quick settlement of product liability
claims when necessary.  In 2010,  we did
not recall any products. 
Our assessment of product quality
risks remains unchanged versus the
prior year.  We regard the likelihood of
occurrence of significant product liability
cases or having to conduct wide-scale
product recalls as possible.  As we have
insurance protecting us against the
financial consequences of significant
product liability cases,  we assess the
potential financial impact as moderate. 

Risks from non-compliance
We face the risk that our employees
breach rules and standards that guide
appropriate and responsible business
behaviour.  In order to successfully
manage this risk,  the Group Policy
Manual was launched at the end of
2006 to provide the framework for basic
work procedures and processes.  It also
includes a Code of Conduct which stipulates that every employee shall act
ethically in compliance with the laws and
regulations of the legal systems where
they conduct Group business.  All of our
employees have to participate in a special
Code of Conduct training as part of our
Global Compliance Programme. 
We continue to regard the risks
of grave misconduct as unlikely.  In
connection with the updated risk
management methodology,  our
assessment of the financial impact on the
Group,  in case they should materialisehas decreased and is now regarded as
minor. 

Financial Risks
Credit risks
 credit risk arises if a customer or other
counterparty to a financial instrument
fails to meet its contractual obligations. 
The adidas Group is exposed to credit
risks from its operating activities and
from certain financing activities.  Credit
risks arise principally from accounts
receivable and to a lesser extent from
other third-party contractual financial
obligations such as other financial
assets,  short-term bank deposits and
derivative financial instruments  see
Note 28,  p.  208.  Without taking into account
any ­ ollateral,  the carrying amount of

financial assets and accounts receivable
represents the maximum exposure to
credit risk. 
At the end of 2010,  there was no
relevant concentration of credit risk
by type of customer or geography. 
Instead,  our credit risk exposure is
mainly influenced by individual customer
characteristics.  Under the Group's
credit policy,  new customers are
analysed for creditworthiness before
standard payment and delivery terms
and conditions are offered.  Tolerance
limits for accounts receivable are also
established for each customer.  Both
creditworthiness and accounts receivable
limits are monitored on an ongoing
basis.  Customers that fail to meet the
Group's minimum creditworthiness are
in general allowed to purchase products
only on a prepayment basis. 

Other activities to mitigate credit risks
include retention of title clauses as well
as,  on a selective basis,  credit insurances,  accounts receivable sales without
recourse and bank guarantees. 
Objective evidence that financial
assets are impaired includes,  for
instance,  significant difficulty of the
issuer or debtor,  indications of the
potential bankruptcy of the borrower and
the disappearance of an active market
for a financial asset because of financial
difficulties.  The Group utilises allowance
accounts for impairments that represent
our estimate of incurred credit losses
with respect to accounts receivable. 
Allowance accounts are used as long
as the Group is satisfied that recovery
of the amount due is possible.  Once this
is no longer the case,  the amounts are
considered irrecoverable and are directly
written off against the financial asset. 
The allowance consists of two
components:
(1) an allowance established for all
receivables dependent on the ageing
structure of receivables past due date
and
(2) a specific allowance that relates
to individually assessed risk for each
specific customer irrespective of
ageing. 
At the end of 2010,  no Group
customer accounted for more than 10%
of accounts receivable.  We therefore
believe that the potential financial impact
of our credit risks from customersparticularly smaller retailers,  is
moderate and we rate the likelihood of
occurrence as possible  see Economic and
Sector Development,  p.  130. 

The adidas Group Treasury department arranges currency and interest
rate hedges,  and invests cash,  with
major banks of a high credit standing
throughout the world.  adidas Group
companies are authorised to work with
banks rated BBB+ or higher. 
Only in exceptional cases are
subsidiaries authorised to work with
banks rated lower than BBB+.  To limit
risk in these cases,  restrictions are
clearly stipulated,  such as maximum
cash deposit levels.  In addition,  the credit
default swap premiums of our partner
banks are monitored on a weekly basis. 
In the event that the defined threshold is
exceeded,  credit balances are shifted to
banks compliant with the limit.  During
2010,  the credit default swap premiums
for many banks further declined
from their highs in the aftermath of
the financial turmoil in 2008.  This
development indicates a slight decrease
of the associated risks. 
Although financial market conditions
improved in 2010,  we continue to
believe that the potential financial
impact of credit risks from these assets
is moderate and the likelihood of
occurrence is possible.  Neverthelesswe believe our risk concentration is
limited due to the broad distribution
of our investment business with more
than 24 banks.  At December 31,  2010no bank accounted for more than 8% of
our investment business and the average
concentration,  including subsidiaries'
short-term deposits in local banks,  was
1%.  This leads to a maximum exposure
of € 105 million in the event of default of
any single bank. 

Furthermore,  we held derivatives with a
positive fair market value in the amount
of € 86 million.  The maximum exposure
to any single bank resulting from these
assets amounted to € 8 million and the
average concentration was 1%. 

Financing and liquidity risks
Liquidity risks arise from not having
the necessary resources available to
meet maturing liabilities with regard to
timing,  volume and currency structure. 
In addition,  the adidas Group faces the
risk of having to accept unfavourable
financing terms due to liquidity
restraints.  Our Group's Treasury
department uses an efficient cash
management system to manage liquidity
risk.  At December 31,  2010,  Group
cash and cash equivalents amounted
to € 116 billion (2009: € 775 million). 
Moreover,  our Group maintains
€ 217 billion bilateral short-term credit
lines and a € 186 billion committed
medium-term syndicated loan facility
with international banks,  which does not
include a market disruption clause.  The
€ 403 billion in credit lines are designed
to ensure sufficient liquidity at all times
 see Treasury,  p.  146.

This includes payments to settle obligations from borrowings as well as cash
outflows from cash-settled derivatives
with negative market values.  Financial
liabilities that may be settled in advance
without penalty are included on the
basis of the earliest date of potential
repayment.  Cash flows for variableinterest liabilities are determined with
reference to the conditions at the balance
sheet date. 
In 2010,  we reduced net debt to
€ 221 million (2009: € 917 million).  With
 ratio of net borrowings over 12-month
rolling EBITDA of 02 times at year-endwe are within the Group's medium-term
guideline of a ratio below two times.  In
the light of our available credit linesfinancing structure and business modelwe assess the likelihood of occurrence of
financing and liquidity risks as unlikelyand therefore expect only a minor
potential financial impact on the Group. 

Currency risks
Currency risks for the adidas Group are
 direct result of multi-currency cash
flows within the Group.  The biggest
single driver behind this risk results
from the mismatch of the currencies
required for sourcing our products
versus the denominations of our sales. 
The vast majority of our sourcing
expenses are in US dollars while sales
are denominated in other currencies to
 large extent most notably the euro. 
Our main exposures are presented in the
adjacent table see  05.  The exposure
from firm commitments and forecasted
transactions was calculated on a
one-year basis. 

168 

In line with IFRS 7 requirements,  we
have estimated the impact on net income
and shareholders' equity based on
changes in our most important currency
exchange rates.  The calculated impacts
mainly result from fair value changes of
our hedging instruments.  The analysis
does not include effects that arise from
the translation of our foreign entities'
financial statements into the Group's
reporting currency.  The sensitivity
analysis is based on the net balance
sheet exposure,  including intercompany
balances from monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies.  Moreover,  all outstanding
currency derivatives were re-evaluated
using hypothetical foreign exchange rates
to determine the effects on net income
and equity.  The analysis was performed
on the same basis for both 2009 and
2010. 
Based on this analysis,  a 10%
increase in the euro versus the US dollar
at December 31,  2010 would have led
to a € 3 million increase in net income. 
The more negative market values of the
US dollar hedges would have decreased
shareholders' equity by € 157 million. 
 10% weaker euro at December 312010 would have led to a € 4 million
decrease in net income.  Shareholders' equity would have increased by
€ 193 million  see  06.  To better reflect
the current foreign exposure structurewe have included EUR/JPY sensitivity
analysis.  Following the change in the
business model in 2010,  the exposure
of the currency pair USD/JPY was bifurcated into EUR/JPY and EUR/USD.  The
impacts of fluctuations of the US dollar
against the Russian rouble and of the
euro against the British pound and the
Japanese yen on net income and shareholders' equity are also included in
accordance with IFRS requirements. 

  Group Management Report Financial Review 

  Risk and Opportunity Report 
However,  many other financial and operational variables that could potentially
reduce the effect of currency fluctuations are excluded from the analysis. 
For instance:
−  nterest rates,  commodity prices and

all other exchange rates are assumed
constant. 
−  xchange rates are assumed at a

year-end value instead of the more
relevant sales-weighted average
figure,  which we utilise internally to
better reflect both the seasonality of
our business and intra-year currency
fluctuations.

exposure (which the hedge instrument
mainly relates to) is not required to be
revalued in this analysis. 
−  perational issues,  such as potential

discounts to key accounts,  which
have high transparency regarding the
impacts of currency on our sourcing
activities (due to their own private label
sourcing efforts),  are also excluded
from this presentation. 
Utilising a centralised currency risk
management system,  our Group
hedges currency needs for projected
sourcing requirements on a rolling 12to 24-month basis  see Treasury,  p.  146. 
Our goal is to have the vast majority of
our hedging volume secured six months
prior to the start of a given season.  In
rare instances,  hedges are contracted
beyond the 24-month horizon.  The Group
also largely hedges balance sheet risks. 
Due to our strong global position,  we are
able to minimise currency risk to a large
extent by utilising natural hedges.

1) Rounding differences may arise in totals. 
2) Adjusted for the USD/RUB forecasted transactions. 

Nevertheless,  our net US dollar cash flow
exposure after natural hedges calculated
for 2011 was roughly € 33 billion at
year-end 2010,  which we hedged using
forward contracts,  currency options and
currency swaps see  05.  Our Group's
Treasury Policy allows us to utilise
hedging instruments,  such as currency
options or option combinations,  which
provide protection while at the same
time retaining the potential to benefit
from future favourable exchange rate
developments in the financial markets. 
As 2011 hedging has almost been
completed,  it is clear that conversion
rates on major currencies will be slightly
less favourable compared to those of
2010.  Volume forecast variances,  greater
currency volatility and an increasing
portion of our business in emerging
markets will expose the adidas Group
to additional currency risks in 2011. 
Furthermore,  translation impacts from
the conversion of non-euro-denominated
results into our Group's functional
currency,  the euro,  might lead to a
material negative impact on our Group's
financial performance.  As a consequencethe assessment of currency risks has
increased.  We now believe the likelihood
of currency risks is highly probable and
we regard the possible financial impact of
currency risks as major. 

Interest rate risks
Changes in global market interest rates
affect future interest payments for
variable-interest liabilities.  As a resultsignificant interest rate increases can
have an adverse effect on the Group's
profitability,  liquidity and financial
position. 
In line with IFRS 7 requirements,  we
have analysed the impact of changes
in the Group's most important interest
rates on net income and shareholders'
equity.  The effect of interest rate changes
on future cash flows is excluded from
this analysis.  Nevertheless,  accrued
interest,  which is recognised as a liabilityhas been re-calculated based on the
hypothetical market interest rates as
at December 31,  2010.  Fair values for
derivative interest rate instruments
accounted for as cash flow hedges
were then re-evaluated based on the
hypothetical market interest rates with
the resulting effects on net income and
equity included in the sensitivity analysis. 
The fair value interest rate risk from
private placements that are hedged with
fair value hedges was also taken into
consideration. 

However,  the effect on the income
statement from changes in the fair values
of hedged items and hedging instruments
attributable to interest rate changes
was not material.  Exclusions from this
analysis are as follows:
−  ome fixed-rate financial instrumentsS
such as certificates of deposit,  which
our Group values at 'fair value through
profit or loss" due to the short-term
maturity of these instruments.  Potential
effects due to changes in interest rates
are considered immaterial and are not
recognised in the sensitivity analysis. 
−  ther fixed-rate financial instruments

are measured at amortised cost.  Since
 change in interest rates would not
change the carrying amount of this
category of instruments,  there is no net
income impact and they are excluded
from this analysis.

The interest rate sensitivity analysis
assumes a parallel shift of the interest
yield curve for all currencies and
was performed on the same basis for
both 2009 and 2010.  A 100 basis point
increase in interest rates at December
31,  2010 would have increased shareholders' equity by € 004 million (2009:
€ 050 million) and decreased net income
by € 022 million (2009: € 065 million).  A
100 basis point decrease of the interest
rates at December 31,  2010 would have
resulted in a € 004 million decrease in
shareholders' equity (2009: € 005 million)
and a € 022 million increase in net
income (2009: € 063 million). 

Group Management Report Financial Review 

  Risk and Opportunity Report

We believe the IFRS 7 interest rate
analysis represents a realistic if rough
estimate of our current interest rate risk. 
To moderate interest rate risks and
maintain financial flexibility,  a core tenet
of our Group's financial strategy is to
continue to use surplus cash flow from
operations to reduce net borrowings
 see Treasury,  p. 146.  Beyond that,  the
adidas Group is constantly looking for
adequate hedging strategies through
interest rate derivatives in order to
mitigate interest rate risks. 
In 2010,  interest rate levels in
North America and Europe reached
new all-time lows.  In the light of the
low interest rate levels,  the easing of
government fiscal action to stimulate
economic growth and rising inflation,  the
risk of upward interest rate adjustments
compared to the prior year has increased. 
Therefore,  we now believe that the
likelihood of a Group-wide interest rate
increase is highly probable.  Neverthelessgiven the increase in our Group's portion
of longer-term fixed rate financing in
2010,  we project any potential interest
rate increases as having a moderate
financial effect.

Strategic and operational
opportunities
Favourable macroeconomic
developments
Since we are a consumer goods companyconsumer confidence and spending
can impact our sales development. 
Therefore,  better than initially forecasted
macroeconomic developments which
support increased discretionary private
consumption can have a positive impact
on our sales and profitability.  In additionlegislative changes,  e.g.  with regard to
the taxation of corporate profits,  can
positively impact Group profitability. 
Growing importance of sports
to fight obesity
Governments are increasingly promoting
living an active lifestyle to fight obesity
and cardiovascular disease.  According
to the International Obesity Task Force
(IOTF),  more than 600 million adults
were considered obese in 2010.  An
additional 10 billion were estimated
to be overweight.  Furthermore,  up to
200 million school-age children were
either obese or overweight.  Once
considered a problem only in affluent
nations,  obesity is also becoming an
issue in countries with low per capita
income.  This development has serious
health consequences and a dramatic
effect on health care expenditures. 

  Group Management Report Financial Review 

  Risk and Opportunity Report 
As a result,  governments and
non-governmental organisations are
increasing their efforts to promote
 healthy lifestyle and encourage
sports participation.  For examplethe US Department of Education
awarded US $ 80 million to schools
and community-based organisations
for use in innovative physical education
classes through the Carol M.  White
Physical Education Program.  Given our
strong market position,  in particular
in categories considered suitable for
weight loss such as training,  running and
swimming,  we expect to benefit from this
trend. 

Ongoing fusion of sport and lifestyle
The border between pure athletics
and lifestyle continues to blur as sport
becomes a more integral part in the lives
of more and more consumers.  People
want to be fashionable when engaging in
sporting activities without compromising
on quality or the latest technological
advances.  At the same time,  performance
features and styles are finding their way
into products meant for more leisureoriented use.  We estimate the global
sports lifestyle market to be at least
three times larger than the performance
market.  This development opens up
additional opportunities for our Group
and our brands which already enjoy
strong positions in this market.  One
example of this is our plan to expand the
adidas NEO label as part of our Route
2015 strategic business plan  see Global
Brands Strategy,  p.  87.

Emerging markets as long-term
growth drivers
According to estimates by the United
Nations,  the global population is
projected to grow from currently 69
billion to 73 billion by the end of 2015
and is estimated to exceed 9 billion by
2050.  A large portion of this growth is
being driven by emerging economies. 
Rising employment rates and real
incomes as well as a growing middle
class are fuelling these economies –
and subsequently our industry.  Sports
participation in countries such as China
or India has historically been lower than
in industrialised countries.  We expect
sports participation rates to increase
over time with increasing leisure timeinvestment in infrastructure and the
broadening of awareness of the benefits
of physical activity.  In addition,  European
and North American sporting goods
brands are often seen as highly desirableeasily accessible,  affordable luxury goods
in emerging markets,  which presents an
additional growth opportunity. 

Women's segment offers
long-term potential
In our opinion,  the women's sports
market is one of the most attractive
segments in the sporting goods industrywith women accounting for more than
 third of total spending on athletic
footwear.  Our Group still generates the
majority of its revenues in men's and
unisex categories.  The adidas Group
will continue to invest in developing
women-specific product offerings in both
performance and lifestyle that emphasise
female individuality,  authenticity and
style.  Examples today include the adidas
Women's Techfit apparel collection,  which
was developed in collaboration with the
Berlin State Ballet,  toning footwear and
apparel at Reebok,  and a specifically
designed series of Burner drivers and
irons at TaylorMade for women. 
Increasing consumer demand
for functional apparel
Consumer demand for functional apparel
has increased significantly in recent
years as consumers realise the benefits
of functional apparel over traditional
cotton sportswear.  Improved moisture
management,  superior ease of motion
and increased comfort are all factors
encouraging consumers to switch to
high-performance apparel. 

The design and development of functional apparel requires significantly
­
more expertise,  product and material
research as well as production
know-how compared to low-tech apparel. 
Therefore,  only a few companies are
able to supply high-end functional
apparel.  Our resources and our positioning as a sports performance leader
enable us to constantly develop innovative products and capitalise on them.  In
2010,  for example,  adidas launched the
Terrex Softshell Jacket.  Engineered for
high-performance comfort on the trailit combines breathable wind protection
with specific fit characteristics that move
with the consumer. 

Growing popularity of 'green" products
Today's consumers are increasingly
aware of the impact their consumption
has on the environment.  Therefore,  they
demand more and more products that
are environmentally benign.  In 2010the adidas Group continued its efforts to
create meaningful product platforms to
drive growth in this area.  In particularwe focused on the extension of the
adidas "Better Place" programme,  for
which the first products were introduced
globally in 2009.  Products and packaging
in the programme are designed taking
sustainability principles into accountsuch as broadening the use of recycled
materials and monitoring energy use in
material and product preparation. 

With all adidas Sport Performance
categories participating in the
programme,  the adidas Group is
moving forward with ambitious plans
in the build-up to the London 2012
Olympic Games  see Sustainability,  p.  120. 
It is our target that 100% of adidas
Sport Performance athletic footwear
products and 20% of apparel products
will have some sustainable content by
2012.  Reebok has also been steadily
introducing eco-friendly products. 
In January 2010,  Reebok launched
the Kids' Green Easy Collection of
toddler and infant footwear.  The Kids'
Green Easy collection addresses
environmental concerns by utilising
recycled raw materials.  Our efforts to
use environmentally friendly materials in
our products are of course not exclusive
to these specific programmes and are
also used in other categories,  albeit to a
lesser extent.

Social media offering new ways
of consumer engagement
Advances in digital communication offer
significant opportunities for our brands to
engage with consumers more frequently
and enhance our opportunity to build
long-lasting relationships and brand
loyalty.  The adidas Group constantly
monitors latest developments and trends
in communication technologies.  The
emergence of social media and social
networks is one such example which
is already helping our brands increase
their consumer reach.  A key advantage
of these tools is that they allow our
brands to engage in a direct dialogue
with our consumers.  For example,  by
offering consumers the opportunity to
actively participate in brand campaigns
or in the design and creation of new
products,  we can generate a far superior
brand experience which resonates in
particular with the young generation. 
In this regard,  most of our divisions are
investing considerable resources to
present the adidas Group's brands within
different social media platforms,  such
as Facebook or Twitter.  For examplethe adidas Originals Facebook page has
attracted more than 7 million followers. 

172 

Strong market positions worldwide
The adidas Group is the market leader in
numerous countries around the world. 
This strong competitive position offers
us many advantages in terms of global
brand visibility,  market power and the
ability to effectively expand our position
in emerging markets.  As a result of
our strong partnership portfolio and
marketing efforts,  consumers around the
globe are highly aware of our brands and
are receptive to our brand messaging. 
This makes demand for our products
more stable compared to smaller
competitors.  Hence,  many retailers
consider our products as core to their
offering.  The adidas Group can therefore
compete more effectively for shelf space. 
Multi-brand approach
We believe there is a natural limit to the
audience size a single brand can appeal
to,  given the diverse tastes and expectations of a highly fragmented consumer
market.  Our multi-brand approach
provides us with the opportunity to
leverage the power of our brands in a
more precise and meaningful way  see
Group Strategy,  p.  80.  We are able to utilise
the combined strengths of each brand to
compete for a higher percentage of the
total market covering a greater number
of demographics,  consumer needs and
price points. 

  Group Management Report Financial Review 

  Risk and Opportunity Report 
Personalisation and customisation
replacing mass wear
Today's consumers are looking for choice
and variety that go beyond choosing
from a wide selection of products.  We
engage in developing unique and relevant
products that fit specific functional and
aesthetic requirements  see Group
Strategy,  p.  80.  For example,  the adidasReebok and TaylorMade brands all
offer different personalisation and
customisation platforms reflecting
each brand's strategy.  Key concepts at
adidas include mi adidas,  miTeam and
miCoach.  For example,  miCoach is a
personalisation concept that combines
product technologies with an intelligent
web platform.  It offers the consumer
 personal and real-time audible
training system.  In August 2010,  adidas
introduced the miCoach app which
allows smart phone users to turn their
phone into a personal coach.  With 'Your
Reebok",  consumers can design and
order completely customised footwear
online.  At TaylorMade-adidas Golfthe myTPball online platform offers
customers the opportunity to create
and order their own golf balls,  and our
Centers of Excellence provide customised
fitting sessions for golfers with expert
fitters and technicians.  We expect the
market for personalised and customised
footwear,  apparel and hardware to grow
strongly and evolve further in the coming
years and we will therefore continue to
invest in the space. 

Exploiting potential of new and
fast-growing sports categories
Exploiting the potential of emerging,  fastgrowing sports categories is another
opportunity for our brands.  Our brand
teams conduct market research and
engage in trend marketing to detect
changes in lifestyle and consumer
needs of their target audience as early
as possible.  Changes in lifestyle,  habits
and attitudes can potentially result in
the emergence of new consumer needs
that are not addressed by current market
product offerings.  For example,  muscle
toning has evolved into a meaningful
category in less than two years.  Having
launched the Reebok EasyTone in 2009
as a walking shoe,  the Reebok brand has
successfully introduced additional styles
and has extended the toning platform
to other sports categories as well as to
apparel.  Similarly,  a growing trend is the
move by athletes and sports enthusiasts
towards more minimalistic products
that promote natural body movement. 
The demand for sports equipment that
promotes natural body movement is seen
as potentially a major future trend.  In
order to tap into this opportunity,  we are
expanding our efforts to bring to market
more lightweight and flexible products
that support the athlete's natural course
of motion. 

Expanding distribution scope
The sporting goods retail environment is
changing constantly.  People increasingly
want to get involved with our brands. 
We therefore continue to adapt our
distribution strategy to cater for this
change and have made controlled
space initiatives a strategic priority. 
This includes retail space management
with key retail partners as well as the
introduction of new own-retail store
formats.  For example in November 2010the Reebok Reetone World opened its
doors in Munich.  In close cooperation
with major retailers,  Reebok offers
alongside the popular toning shoe some
exclusive pieces of the 'On the Move"
collection.  Customers can also design
and personalise their own Reebok shoes
at the YourReebok station.  In additionin the run-up to the 2010/11 basketball
season,  adidas launched exclusive NBA
shop-in-shops within several hundred
Champs Sports locations throughout the
USA.  Through initiatives like these,  we
believe we will be able to more effectively
target consumers and involve them
emotionally with our products. 

Cost optimisation drives profitability
improvements
Continued optimisation of key business
processes and strict cost control are
vital to achieving high profitability and
return on invested capital.  We are
confident that there is still significant
opportunity to further streamline cost
structures throughout our Group.  For
example,  we believe we will be able to
realise medium-term economies of scale
as we look for possibilities to further
integrate adidas and Reebok functions. 
In addition,  we continue searching
for ways to increase efficiency in our
supply chain and make it truly demanddriven.  Furthermore,  by implementing
end-to-end planning processes and
improving our replenishment capabilitieswe see opportunities to not only better
serve our customers but also to reduce
our operating working capital needs
 see Global Operations,  p.  106.  Another
example in this respect is the reduction
of the number of articles; this reduces
workload in the creation area and
warehouse costs,  and allows us to
offer more focused ranges to our retail
partners. 

Financial opportunities
Favourable financial market changes
Favourable exchange and interest rate
developments can potentially have a
positive impact on the Group's financial
results.  Our Group Treasury department
closely monitors the financial markets to
identify and exploit opportunities  see
Treasury,  p.  146. 

Management assessment
of overall risks and
opportunities
Overall risk profile unchanged
versus prior year
Management aggregates all risks
reported by different business units and
functions.  Based on the compilation
of risks taking into account the
occurrence likelihood and potential
financial impact and the current business
outlook explained within this report –
adidas Group Management does not
foresee any individual or aggregate risks
which could materially jeopardise the
viability of the Group as a going concern. 
This assessment is also supported by
the historical response to our financing
demands  see Treasury,  p.  146.  The adidas
Group therefore has not sought an
official rating by any of the leading rating
agencies. 
Management remains confident
that the Group's earnings power forms
 solid basis for our future business
development and provides the necessary
resource to pursue the opportunities
available to the Group. 
Compared to the prior year's
assessment,  the following risks have
increased: hazard risks,  risks from rising
input costs,  customer risks,  personnel
risks,  social and environmental riskscurrency risks as well as interest rate
risks.  The assessment of the following
risks has decreased: macroeconomic
risks,  inventory risks,  product design
and development risks,  risks from
non-compliance as well as financing and
liquidity risks.  Nonetheless,  the changes
in individual risks have no substantial
impact on the overall adidas Group
risk profile,  which we believe remains
unchanged compared to the prior year.

Subsequent Events and Outlook
In 2011,  most major economies are projected to expand,  with the sporting goods industry and the adidas Group expected to
benefit from increasing consumer confidence and spending.  Based on our innovative strength,  extensive pipeline of new and
fresh products as well as marketing initiatives,  we expect top- and bottom-line improvements in our Group's financial results in
2011.  We forecast adidas Group sales to increase at a mid- to high-single-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis due to growth in
the Wholesale and Retail segments as well as in Other Businesses.  Group gross margin is expected to be in a range between
475% and 480%.  Pressures from higher input costs will weigh on otherwise positive effects anticipated from our regional
and product mix.  Operating margin is forecasted to improve to a level between 75% and 80%,  driven by lower other operating
expenses as a percentage of sales.  As a result,  we project earnings per share to grow at a rate between 10% and 15% to a
level between € 298 and € 312.

  Subsequent Events and Outlook 
Global economic recovery to support
Group growth in 2011
The speed of economic recovery in
2010 has led to a higher degree of
confidence amongst economic analysis
bodies and research institutes for 2011. 
According to the World Bank,  growth of
the global economy in 2011 is expected
to be at around 33%.  Forecasters
in general predict strong growth in
emerging markets and a continuation
of the modest recovery in advanced
economies.  Nonetheless,  structural
issues such as high levels of sovereign
debt and high unemployment in many
developed economies pose risks to
global economic growth.  In addition,  the
potential overheating of some emerging
economies with rising asset prices and
significant inflationary pressures are
 concern,  despite monetary policies
and quantitative measures being
implemented to rein in these excesses. 
On the positive side,  regardless of
anticipated inflation,  economists predict
that consumer spending will pick up
globally in 2011. 

Therefore,  we believe the economic
environment will be supportive to our
growth aspirations in 2011.  The growth
of the economy,  however,  is likely to
continue to drive commodity prices
higher,  which we predict will further add
to input cost pressures in the second half
of 2011 and beyond. 

In Western Europe,  GDP is expected to
increase at a low rate of around 15% in
2011,  driven by growth in Germany and
France.  Manufacturing investmentsexport activity and a steady improvement
in consumer spending are expected to
be the key drivers of growth.  Howevernegative headwinds from austerity
measures due to sovereign debt concerns
and high unemployment levels in many
peripheral economies of the region are
expected to persist.  European emerging
markets are estimated to grow at around
41% in 2011,  with most of the economies
in this region forecasted to be positively
impacted by rising exports and steadily
improving consumer spending.  Russia
in particular is projected to benefit from
expected increases in commodity prices. 
In North America,  GDP is forecasted
to grow approximately 33% in 2011. 
Expansion in the USA is expected to be
supported by further stimulus measures
such as quantitative easing,  tax cuts and
benefit payments.  Low interest ratesincreases in consumer and corporate
spending as well as strong exports
supported by a weakening dollar are
also forecasted to contribute to growth. 
Nevertheless,  the USA's significant debt
obligations,  high unemployment rates
and low wage and personal income
growth are all negative factors for the
region. 

In Asia,  growth rates are expected to
remain high,  but to decelerate slightly
to 48% in 2011.  This will be driven by
growth in the region's emerging markets. 
Of these,  GDP growth in China and India
is expected to remain robust at 89% and
80%,  respectively,  driven by domestic
demand.  In Japan,  however,  growth rates
are projected to decelerate to around
10% in 2011.  As government stimulus
comes to an end,  low levels of domestic
demand including declines in consumer
spending are expected to weigh on the
economy. 
In Latin America,  growth rates are
likely to moderate to a level of around
48% in 2011.  Increases in commodity
prices as well as strong export levels
are expected to positively impact many
of the region's economies.  Most Latin
American economies are also forecasted
to see continued wage growth and strong
consumer spending levels. 

Increases in consumer spending to
support sporting goods industry growth
In the absence of any major economic
shocks,  we expect the global sporting
goods industry to expand in 2011.  In
advanced economies,  despite high
unemployment rates and modest levels
of wage growth,  consumer spending
increases are forecasted to be higher
compared to the prior year.  Private
consumption in the emerging markets
is forecasted to continue at robust
rates,  with increases particularly in
discretionary spending.  While these
trends underpin the opportunity for
growth for the sporting goods industry
in 2011,  inflation in footwear and apparel
prices due to higher input costs may
dampen growth. 

In Western Europe,  the sporting goods
industry is expected to grow modestly
in 2011,  despite tough prior year
comparisons due to the 2010 FIFA World
Cup.  Growth in apparel in particular
is expected to be challenging,  with
increasing pressure on prices from
rising input costs.  The improvement in
trends seen in the European emerging
markets is expected to continue in 2011. 
Growth is projected to be led by Russiawhere increasing disposable incomes
and consumer spending are promoting
expansion in the retail and sporting
goods industry. 
In North America,  stimulus
programmes and tax breaks are expected
to support consumer spending in 2011which is reflected in increasing levels
of consumer confidence.  Footwear and
apparel sales in the sporting goods
industry are projected to grow in 2011. 
From a category perspective,  basketballlightweight running and outdoor apparel
are seen as particular drivers for the
year. 
In Greater China,  rising domestic
consumption is forecasted to propel
sporting goods sales in 2011.  Income
levels have also been growing in the
lower tier cities,  which will support the
expansion of the industry into these
markets as these consumers spend more
on discretionary items. 

In other Asian markets,  the sporting
goods industry is forecasted to growhowever with regional variances.  Rapidly
growing markets such as India,  Indonesia
and Vietnam are expected to provide
further potential for sporting goods
brands.  India should receive an additional
tailwind from the 2011 ICC Cricket World
Cup.  However,  in Japan falling consumer
confidence and spending is forecasted to
continue in 2011,  with lacklustre demand
ensuring the sporting goods sector is
likely to remain challenged. 
The sporting goods industry in Latin
America is projected to grow in 2011with falling unemployment rates and
rising income levels promoting consumer
spending.  This is expected to support
discretionary spending in this region
and positively impact the sporting goods
sector.  However,  inflationary pressureparticularly on apparel,  is a potential
headwind to growth.

adidas Group currency-neutral sales to
increase at a mid- to high-single-digit
rate in 2011
We expect adidas Group sales to increase
at a mid- to high-single-digit rate on
 currency-neutral basis in 2011.  The
positive sales development will be
driven by rising consumer confidence
as the global economy continues to
improve.  The positive impacts of our
high exposure to fast-growing emerging
markets,  the further expansion of Retail
as well as continued momentum at the
Reebok brand will more than offset the
non-recurrence of sales related to the
2010 FIFA World Cup.  As a result,  we
expect the adidas Group to outperform
global economic growth in 2011. 
Currency-neutral Wholesale
revenues expected to increase
at a mid-single-digit rate
We project currency-neutral Wholesale
segment revenues to increase at a
mid-single-digit rate compared to the
prior year.  Order backlog development
as well as positive retailer and trade
show feedback support our growth
expectations for 2011.  Currency-neutral
adidas Sport Performance sales are
forecasted to increase at a low- to
mid-single-digit rate due to growth in
key categories such as running and
training.  adidas Sport Style revenues are
projected to increase at a high-singleto low-double-digit rate on a currencyneutral basis as a result of the expanded
distribution scope and continued
momentum in our product lines,  in
particular adidas NEO.  Currency-neutral
Reebok sales are expected to increase
due to growth in the women's fitness
and men's training category as well as
increases in the Classics business. 

176 

Retail sales to increase at a low-doubledigit rate on a currency-neutral basis
adidas Group currency-neutral Retail
segment sales are projected to grow at a
low-double-digit rate in 2011.  Expansion
of the Group's own-retail store base and
comparable store sales are expected to
contribute at a similar rate to the revenue
growth.  The Group expects a net increase
of its store base by around 100 adidas
and Reebok stores in 2011.  We forecast to
open around 200 new stores,  depending
on the availability of desired locations. 
New stores will primarily be located in
emerging markets in Eastern Europe. 
Approximately 100 stores will be closed
over the course of the year.  Around 220
stores will be remodelled.  Comparable
store sales are expected to increase at
 mid-single-digit rate compared to the
prior year.  As a result of the forecasted
improvements in the consumer
environment in 2011,  concept stores are
expected to perform slightly better than
factory outlets.

  Subsequent Events and Outlook 
Currency-neutral sales of Other
Businesses to increase at a midsingle-digit rate
In 2011,  revenues of Other Businesses
are expected to increase at a mid-singledigit rate on a currency-neutral basis. 
TaylorMade-adidas Golf currency-neutral
sales are projected to grow at a low- to
mid-single-digit rate compared to the
prior year.  Product launches in core
categories such as metalwoods,  irons
and putters should support growth in
this segment against a slow recovery
in the global golf market.  Revenues at
Rockport are forecasted to increase
at a high-single- to low-double-digit
rate as a result of improvements in the
brand's product portfolio and own-retail
expansion.  Sales at Reebok-CCM Hockey
are expected to grow at a low-single-digit
rate in 2011,  mainly due to new product
introductions.

adidas Group sales expected
to grow in all regions
We expect Group currency-neutral
revenues to increase in all our regions
in 2011,  however at varying growth
rates.  In Western Europe,  despite the
non-recurrence of the 2010 FIFA World
Cup which provided a positive stimulus
in the region in 2010,  the gradual
improvement in the macroeconomic
environment will positively impact
sales development in this regionalbeit at a moderate level.  Growth
in Central Europe is likely to offset
challenging conditions in the region's
peripheral markets.  In European
Emerging Markets,  the expansion of
and increasing sophistication in our
own-retail activities as well as improving
wholesale conditions in some of the
region's markets are forecasted to have
 positive influence on Group sales.  In
North America,  we expect to benefit from
continued momentum in particular with
the adidas and Reebok brands.  This will
be driven by new product introductions
and product extensions.  In Greater Chinafollowing a sales decline in 2010,  we
expect a return to strong growth in this
region in 2011.  This will be driven by
more current levels of inventory as well
as the expansion of our retail footprintincluding the further roll-out of adidas
Originals and adidas NEO.  In Other Asian
Markets,  lacklustre consumer demand
in Japan will be more than offset by a
strong performance in the region's other
markets such as South Korea and India. 
Lastly,  in Latin America,  the strong
positioning of our brands is expected
to more than compensate for the
non-recurrence of the positive impetus
from sales associated with the 2010 FIFA
World Cup. 

Group gross margin to be in a
range from 475% to 480%
In 2011,  the adidas Group gross margin
is forecasted to be roughly in line with
the prior year,  at a level between 475%
and 480% (2010: 478%).  While we expect
gross margin in our Retail segment as
well as Other Businesses to improvegross margin in the Wholesale segment
is forecasted to decline.  In 2011,  Group
gross margin will benefit from positive
regional mix effects,  as growth rates
in emerging markets are projected to
be above growth rates in more mature
markets.  In addition,  improvements in the
Retail segment as well as at the Reebok
brand will positively influence Group
gross margin development.  Howeverthese positive effects will be offset by
several factors.  In particular,  sourcing
costs will increase significantly compared
to the prior year as a result of rising raw
material costs and capacity constraints. 
In addition,  hedging terms in 2011 will be
slightly less favourable compared to the
prior year.

Group other operating expenses to
decrease as a percentage of sales
In 2011,  the Group's other operating
expenses as a percentage of sales are
expected to decrease modestly (2010:
421%).  Sales and marketing working
budget expenses as a percentage of
sales are projected to decline modestly
compared to the prior year.  Marketing
investments to support Reebok's growth
strategy in the men's and women's
fitness category,  as well as investments
to support growth in our key attack
markets North America,  Greater China
and Russia/CIS will be offset by the
non-recurrence of expenses in relation to
adidas' presence at the 2010 FIFA World
Cup.  Operating overhead expenditures
as a percentage of sales are forecasted
to decline slightly in 2011.  Higher
administrative and personnel expenses
in the Retail segment due to the planned
expansion of the Group's store base will
be offset by leverage and efficiency gains
in the Group's non-allocated central
costs. 
We expect the number of employees
within the adidas Group to increase
versus the prior year level.  Additional
hires will be mainly related to own-retail
expansion.  The majority of new hires will
be employed on a part-time basis and
will be located in emerging markets. 
The adidas Group will continue to spend
around 1% of Group sales on research
and development in 2011.  Areas of
particular focus include customisation
and digital sports products at adidasas well as supporting the expansion of
Reebok's fitness and training positioning
 see Research and Development,  p.  110. 

178 

Operating margin to continue to expand
In 2011,  we expect the operating margin
for the adidas Group to increase to a level
between 75% and 80% (2010: 75%). 
Lower other operating expenses as a
percentage of sales are expected to be
the primary driver of the improvement. 
Earnings per share to increase to a
level between € 298 and € 312
Earnings per share are expected to
increase at a rate of 10% to 15% to a level
between € 298 and € 312 (2010 diluted
earnings per share: € 271).  Top-line
improvement and an increased operating
margin will be the primary drivers of
this positive development.  In additionwe expect lower interest rate expenses
in 2011 as a result of a lower average
level of net borrowings.  The Group tax
rate is expected to be at a similar level
compared to the prior year level (2010:
295%). 
Operating working capital as a
percentage of sales to increase
In 2011,  average operating working
capital as a percentage of sales is
expected to increase compared to the
prior year level (2010: 208%).  This is
mainly due to working capital increases
to support the growth of our business. 

  Group Management Report Financial Review 

  Subsequent Events and Outlook 
Investment level to be between
€ 350 million and € 400 million
In 2011,  investments in tangible and
intangible assets are expected to amount
to € 350 million to € 400 million (2010:
€ 269 million).  Investments will focus
on adidas and Reebok controlled space
initiatives,  in particular in emerging
markets.  These investments will account
for almost one-third of total investments
in 2011.  Other areas of investment
include the further development of
the adidas Group Headquarters in
Herzogenaurach,  Germany,  and the
increased deployment of SAP and other
IT systems in major subsidiaries within
the Group.  All investments within the
adidas Group in 2011 are expected to be
fully financed through cash generated
from operations. 
Excess cash to be used to support
growth initiatives
In 2011,  we expect continued positive
cash flows from operating activities.  Cash
will be used to finance working capital
needs,  investment activities,  as well as
dividend payments.  We intend to largely
use excess cash to invest in our Route
2015 growth initiatives and to further
reduce net borrowings.  Over the long
term,  we aim to maintain a ratio of net
borrowings over EBITDA of less than two
times as measured at year-end (2010
ratio: 02). 

Efficient liquidity management in
place for 2011 and beyond
Efficient liquidity management continues
to be a priority for the adidas Group
in 2011.  We focus on continuously
anticipating the cash inflows from
the operating activities of our Group
segments,  as this represents the main
source of liquidity within the Group.  On
 quarterly basis,  liquidity is forecasted
on a multi-year financial and liquidity
plan.  Long-term liquidity is ensured
by continued positive free cash flows
and sufficient unused committed and
uncommitted credit facilities.  In 2011,  we
do not expect any financing activities in
order to replace maturing credit facilities
 see Treasury,  p.  146. 
Management to propose
dividend of € 080
In light of the strong cash flow generation
in 2010 and the significantly reduced
level of net borrowings,  Management
will recommend paying a dividend of
€ 080 to shareholders at the Annual
General Meeting (AGM) on May 122011,  representing an increase of 129%
compared to 2009 (2009: € 035).  Subject
to shareholder approval,  the dividend will
be paid on May 13,  2011.  The proposal
represents a payout ratio of 30% of net
income as in the prior year and complies
with our dividend policy,  according to
which we intend to pay out between 20%
and 40% of net income attributable to
shareholders annually.  Based on the
number of shares outstanding at the end
of 2010,  the dividend payout will increase
to € 167 million compared to € 73 million
in the prior year. 

adidas Group defines long-term
strategic goals
Based on the adidas Group's strong
brands,  premium products,  extensive
global presence and its commitment
to innovation and the consumer,  the
adidas Group aspires to grow its business
significantly until 2015.  According
to our 2015 strategic business plan
'Route 2015",  which was announced
in November 2010,  total Group sales
are targeted to grow 45% to 50% on a
currency-neutral basis over the five-year
period,  thereby outperforming total
market growth (both GDP and sporting
goods industry).  In addition,  we aim to
grow our bottom line faster than the
top line.  It is targeted to grow annual
earnings at a compound annual growth
rate of 15% and to reach an operating
margin of 11% sustainably by 2015 at
the latest.  For 2012,  in line with our
mid-term guidance,  we project adidas
Group sales and net income to increase
compared to 2011. 

In order to reach our strategic goals and
create long-term sustainable shareholder value,  we have defined clear
strategic pillars.  These include:
− Clear market positioning and brand
prioritisation: We believe that we have
significant growth potential to exploit
from our portfolio of brands.  The majority
of our targeted growth will come from
Global Brands which we anticipate will
contribute 90% of the Group's expected
revenue increase over the period  see
Global Brands Strategy,  p.  87.  Areas within
the adidas and Reebok brands that
were identified as key contributors to
sustainable growth for the adidas Group
include:
–  aining sales and market share in the

running and basketball categories
within adidas Sport Performance
–  xpanding adidas Sport Style in the fast

fashion business with NEO
–  stablishing Reebok as the leading

fitness and training brand
–  eading the industry in the fields of

customisation and interactivity. 
By brand,  we expect adidas Sport
Performance sales to grow at a midto high-single-digit compound annual
growth rate.  We plan to increase adidas
Sport Style and Reebok sales at a
double-digit compound annual growth
rate until 2015. 

− Expand presence in key growth
markets: We have identified North
America,  Greater China,  Russia/CISLatin America,  Japan,  UK and India
as key growth markets for the next
five years.  Of those markets,  the three
"attack markets" North America,  Greater
China and Russia/CIS are expected to
contribute around 50% of the total Group
growth until 2015,  with each market
targeting a double-digit compound
annual growth rate.  In the USA,  the
Group's brands have enormous potential
to gain market share by focusing on
improved distribution and allowing a
higher share of products to be specifically
designed for that market.  In emerging
markets such as China and Russia,  rising
standards of living,  increasing disposable
income,  positive demographic trends
and growing sports participation should
support demand for sporting goods. 
− Intensify controlled space focus: We
intend to increase the portion of sales
that comes from controlled space
initiatives to at least 45% of Group sales
in the coming years.  This includes
new openings of adidas and Reebok
own-retail stores,  the further extension of
our mono-branded store base in markets
such as China,  as well as new shopin-shop initiatives with retail partners
around the world.  In terms of our own
retail,  we intend to open at least 500
adidas and Reebok stores over the next
five years,  as well as grow significantly
our eCommerce business,  which we
project to increase to € 500 million over
the period  see Global Sales Strategy,  p.  82. 

− Leverage growth and operational
scale through to bottom line: A higher
exposure to emerging markets as well
as expanding controlled space activities
are important levers to improving brand
presence,  increasing sell-through
and driving higher Group profitability. 
In addition,  we continuously work on
streamlining internal processes to
accelerate decision-making,  reduce
complexity and make our organisation
leaner and more efficient.  Therefore,  we
believe there is significant potential to
increase the Group's operating margin to
11% sustainably by 2015. 
− Maintain financial flexibility: We strive
over the long term to maintain a ratio
of net borrowings over EBITDA of less
than two times.  A strong balance sheet
increases our flexibility to realise valuegenerating medium- and long-term
opportunities in the best interests of our
shareholders as they arise.

Auditor's Report
We have audited the consolidated financial statements prepared by adidas AG,  Herzogenaurach,  comprising the statement of financial position,  income
statement,  statement of comprehensive income,  statement of changes in equity,  statement of cash flows and the notes,  together with the Group
management report for the fiscal year January 1 to December 31,  2010.  The preparation of the consolidated financial statements and the Group
management report in accordance with IFRS,  as adopted by the EU,  and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315a (1)
German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch HGB) is the responsibility of the company's Executive Board.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on the consolidated financial statements and on the Group management report based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with § 317 HGB and German generally accepted standards for the audit
of financial statements promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (Institute of Public Auditors in Germany,  'IDW").  Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit such that misstatements materially affecting the presentation of the net assets,  financial position,  and profit or loss in the
consolidated financial statements in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework and in the Group management report are detected
with reasonable assurance.  Knowledge of the business activities and the economic and legal environment of the Group and evaluations of possible
misstatements are taken into account in the determination of audit procedures.  The effectiveness of the accounting-related internal control system
and the evidence supporting the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and the Group management report are examined primarily on
 test basis within the framework of the audit.  The audit includes assessing the annual financial statements of the entities included in consolidationthe determination of entities to be included in consolidation,  the accounting and consolidation principles used,  and significant estimates made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and Group management report.  We believe that
our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
Our audit has not led to any reservations. 
In our opinion,  based on the findings of our audit,  the consolidated financial statements comply with IFRS,  as adopted by the EU,  the additional
requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315a (1) HGB and give a true and fair view of the net assets,  financial position and profit or loss
of the Group in accordance with these requirements.  The Group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and as a
whole provides a suitable view of the Group's position and suitably presents the opportunities and risks of future development.

Summary of significant accounting policies

02

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the consolidationaccounting and valuation principles described below. 

Principles of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of adidas AG and its direct
and indirect subsidiaries,  which are prepared in accordance with uniform accounting principles. 
 company is considered a subsidiary if it is controlled by adidas AG,  e.g.  by directly or
indirectly governing the financial and operating policies of the respective enterprise.

 schedule of the shareholdings of adidas AG is shown in Attachment II to these Notes.  Furthera schedule of the shareholdings of adidas AG will be published on the electronic platform of the
German Federal Gazette. 
Within the scope of the first-time consolidation,  all acquired assets and liabilities are
recognised in the statement of financial position at fair value at the acquisition date.  A debit
difference between the acquisition cost and the proportionate fair value of assets,  liabilities and
contingent liabilities is shown as goodwill.  A credit difference is recorded in the income statement. 
Acquisitions of additional investments in Group companies which are already controlled are
recorded as equity transactions.  Therefore,  neither fair value adjustments of assets and liabilities
nor gains or losses are recognised.  Any difference between the cost for such an additional
investment and the carrying amount of the net assets at the acquisition date is directly recorded in
shareholders' equity. 
The financial effects of intercompany transactions,  as well as any unrealised gains and
losses arising from intercompany business relations are eliminated in preparing the consolidated
financial statements.

Currency translation
Transactions of assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into the respective
functional currency at spot rates on the transaction date. 
In the individual financial statements of subsidiaries,  monetary items denominated in nonfunctional currencies of the subsidiaries are generally measured at closing exchange rates at the
balance sheet date.  The resulting currency gains and losses are recorded directly in the income
statement.

  Notes 
Assets and liabilities of the Group's non-euro functional currency subsidiaries are translated into
the reporting currency,  the 'euro",  which is also the functional currency of adidas AG,  at closing
exchange rates at the balance sheet date.  Revenues and expenses are translated at exchange
rates on the transaction dates.  All cumulative differences from the translation of equity of foreign
subsidiaries resulting from changes in exchange rates,  are included in a separate item within
shareholders' equity without affecting the income statement.

Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments,  such as currency options,  forward contracts
as well as interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps,  to hedge its exposure to
foreign exchange and interest rate risks.  In accordance with its Treasury Policy,  the Group does
not enter into derivative financial instruments with banks for trading purposes. 
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised in the statement of financial position
at fair value,  and subsequently also measured at their fair value.  The method of recognising the
resulting gains or losses is dependent on the nature of the item being hedged.  On the date a
derivative contract is entered into,  the Group designates certain derivatives as either a hedge of a
forecasted transaction (cash flow hedge),  a hedge of the fair value of a recognised asset or liability
(fair value hedge) or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign entity. 
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedgesand that are effective,  as defined in IAS 39 'Financial instruments: recognition and measurement"are recognised in equity.  When the effectiveness is not 100%,  the ineffective portion of the
fair value is recognised in the income statement.  Accumulated gains and losses in equity are
transferred to the income statement in the same periods during which the hedged forecasted
transaction affects the income statement. 
For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges,  the gains or losses on the
derivatives and the offsetting gains or losses on the hedged items are recognised immediately in
the income statement. 

Certain derivative transactions,  while providing effective economic hedges under the Group's risk
management policies,  may not qualify for hedge accounting under the specific rules of IAS 39. 
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting
under IAS 39 are recognised immediately in the income statement. 
Hedges of net investments in foreign entities are accounted for in a similar way to cash flow
hedges.  If,  for example,  the hedging instrument is a derivative (e.g.  a forward contract) or,  for
example,  a foreign currency borrowing,  effective currency gains and losses in the derivative and all
gains and losses arising on the translation of the borrowing,  respectively,  are recognised in equity. 
The Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items at
transaction inception,  as well as the risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking
various hedge transactions.  This process includes linking all derivatives designated as hedges
to specific firm commitments and forecasted transactions.  The Group also documents its
assessment of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective
by using different methods of effectiveness testing,  such as the 'dollar offset method" or the
'hypothetical derivative method". 
The fair values of forward contracts and currency options are determined on the basis of
market conditions on the reporting dates.  The fair value of a currency option is determined
using generally accepted models to calculate option prices.  The fair market value of an option is
influenced not only by the remaining term of the option but also by additional factors,  such as the
actual foreign exchange rate and the volatility of the underlying foreign currency base. 

Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents represent cash and short-term bank deposits with maturities of three
months or less from the date of acquisition. 
Cash equivalents are short-term,  highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to
known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 
Receivables and other financial assets
Receivables and other financial assets are recognised at fair value,  which is estimated as the
present value of future cash flows discounted at the market rate of interest at the balance sheet
date.  Subsequently,  these are measured at amortised cost using the 'effective interest method".  If
necessary,  required allowances are determined on the basis of individual risk assessment and of
the ageing structure of receivables past due. 
Inventories
Merchandise and finished goods are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value,  which
is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of
completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.  Costs are determined using
 standard valuation method: the 'average cost method".  Costs of finished goods include cost
of raw materials,  direct labour and the components of the manufacturing overheads which can
reasonably be attributed.  The allocation of overheads is based on the planned average utilisation. 
The net realisable value allowances are computed consistently throughout the Group based on
the age and expected future sales of the items on hand. 

Assets/liabilities classified as held for sale
Assets and liabilities (primarily non-current) that are expected to be recovered principally through
sale rather than through continuing use are classified as held for sale.  These are measured at the
lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.  A potential gain or loss is offset
against the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities classified as held for sale. 
Property,  plant and equipment
Property,  plant and equipment are measured at amortised cost.  This comprises any costs directly
attributable to bringing the asset to the condition necessary for it to be capable of operating
in the manner intended by Management less accumulated depreciation (except for land and
construction in progress) and accumulated impairment losses.  Depreciation is recognised
utilising the 'straight-line method",  except where the 'declining-balance method" is more
appropriate in light of the actual utilisation pattern.  Estimated useful lives are as follows:
Estimated useful lives of property,  plant and equipment
Years 
Buildings/Leasehold improvements 
5 – 50

Technical equipment and machinery as well as other equipment
and furniture and fittings 
2 – 10

Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.  Renewals and improvements
are capitalised and depreciated separately,  if the recognition criteria are met. 

Impairment losses
If facts and circumstances indicate that non-current assets (e.g.  property,  plant and equipmentintangible assets including goodwill and certain financial assets) might be impaired,  the
recoverable amount is determined.  It is measured as the higher of its fair value less costs to sell
and value in use.  An impairment loss is recognised in other operating expenses if the carrying
amount exceeds the recoverable amount.  If there is an impairment loss for a cash-generating
unit,  first the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cash-generating unit is reducedand subsequently the other non-current assets of the unit are reduced pro rata on the basis of the
carrying amount of each asset in the unit. 
Irrespective of whether there is an impairment indication,  intangible assets with an indefinite
useful life and goodwill acquired in business combinations are tested annually for impairment. 
An impairment loss recognised in goodwill is not reversible.  With respect to all other impaired
assets,  an impairment loss recognised in prior periods is reversed affecting the income statement
if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.  An
impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed
the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of depreciation or amortisation) if no
impairment loss had been recognised. 

Consolidated Financial Statements

Leases
Under finance lease arrangements,  substantially all risks and rewards associated with an asset
are transferred to the Group as the lessee.  At the beginning of the lease arrangement the
respective asset and a corresponding liability are recognised at the fair value of the asset or,  if
lower,  the net present value of the minimum lease payments.  For subsequent measurementminimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction of the
outstanding liability.  The finance expense is allocated to each period during the lease term so as
to produce a constant periodic interest rate on the remaining balance of the liability.  In additiondepreciation and any impairment losses for the associated assets are recognised. 
Under operating lease agreements,  rent expenses are recognised on a straight-line basis over the
term of the lease. 
Intangible assets (except goodwill)
Intangible assets are valued at amortised cost less accumulated amortisation (except for assets
with indefinite useful lives) and impairment losses.  Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line
basis with the following estimated useful lives:
Estimated useful lives of intangible assets
Years 
Trademarks
Software
Patents,  trademarks and concessions 
indefinite
3 – 5
5 – 15

The adidas Group determined that there was no impairment necessary for any of its trademarks
with indefinite useful lives in the years ending December 31,  2010 and 2009,  respectively. 
The recoverable amount is determined on the basis of fair value less costs to sell (costs to
sell are calculated with 1% of the fair value).  The fair value is determined in discounting notional
royalty savings after tax and adding a tax amortisation benefit,  resulting from the amortisation of
the acquired asset ('relief-from-royalty method").  These calculations use projections of net sales
related royalty savings,  based on financial planning which covers a period of five years in total.  The
level of the applied royalty rate for the determination of the royalty savings is based on contractual
agreements between the adidas Group and external licensees as well as public available royalty
rate agreements for similar assets.  Notional royalty savings beyond this period are extrapolated
using steady growth rates of 17% (2009: 17%).  The growth rates do not exceed the long-term
average growth rate of the business to which the trademarks are allocated. 

192 

  Consolidated Financial Statements 

  Notes 
The discount rate is based on a weighted average cost of capital calculation derived using a fiveyear average market-weighted debt/equity structure and financing costs referencing the Group's
major competitors.  The discount rate used is an after-tax rate and reflects the specific equity and
country risk.  The applied discount rate depends on the respective intangible asset being valued
and ranges between 64% and 83% (2009: 93%). 
Expenditures during the development phase of internally generated intangible assets are
capitalised when they occur if they qualify for recognition under IAS 38 'Intangible Assets". 

Goodwill
Goodwill is an asset representing the future economic benefits arising from assets acquired in a
business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognised.  This results
when the purchase cost exceeds the fair value of acquired identifiable assets,  liabilities and
contingent liabilities.  Goodwill arising from the acquisition of a foreign entity and any fair value
adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets,  liabilities and contingent liabilities of that foreign
entity are treated as assets,  liabilities and contingent liabilities of the respective reporting entityand are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the date of the initial consolidation.  Goodwill is
carried in the functional currency of the acquired foreign entity. 
Acquired goodwill is valued at cost and is tested for impairment on an annual basis and
additionally when there are indications of potential impairment. 
As a result of the Group's reorganisation in the second half of 2009,  goodwill was reallocated
to the corresponding cash-generating units based on a relative value approach.  The corresponding
cash-generating units comprise 17 regional markets which are responsible for the joint
distribution of adidas and Reebok as well as TaylorMade-adidas Golf,  Rockport and Reebok-CCM
Hockey. 
The cash-generating units (or groups of units) represent the lowest level within the Group at
which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes after the Group's reorganisation. 
The impairment test for goodwill has been performed based on cash-generating units (or
groups of units). 
Overall,  no impairment of goodwill resulted. 

The recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is determined on the basis of value in use. 
This calculation uses cash flow projections based on the financial planning covering a five-year
period in total.  The planning is based on the strategic business plan of the adidas Group 'Route
2015" as communicated on November 8,  2010 see Subsequent Events and Outlook,  p.  174 and reflects
an expected mid- to high-single-digit sales increase for the majority of the cash-generating units
(or groups of units).  For a few emerging markets,  we expect,  on average,  a low-double-digit sales
growth rate.  Furthermore,  we expect the operating margin to improve primarily driven by a slight
improvement in the gross margin as well as lower operating expenses as a percentage of sales. 
The planning for capital expenditure and working capital is primarily based on past experience. 
The planning for future tax payments is based on current statutory corporate tax rates of the
single cash-generating units (or groups of units).  Cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated
using steady growth rates of 17% (2009: 17%).  According to our expectations,  these growth rates
do not exceed the long-term average growth rate of the business in which each cash-generating
unit operates. 
Discount rates are based on a weighted average cost of capital calculation considering a fiveyear average market-weighted debt/equity structure and financing costs referencing the Group's
major competitors for each cash-generating unit (or group of units).  The discount rates used are
after-tax rates and reflect the specific equity and country risk of the relevant cash-generating unit. 
The carrying amounts of acquired goodwill as well as of intangible assets allocated to the
respective cash-generating unit (or group of units) and the respective discount rates applied to the
cash flow projections are as follows:

Research and development
Research costs are expensed in full as incurred.  Development costs are also expensed as incurred
if they do not meet the recognition criteria of IAS 38 'Intangible Assets". 
The Group spent € 102 million and € 86 million on product research and development for the
years ending December 31,  2010 and 2009,  respectively. 

Allocation of goodwill 
Other provisions and accrued liabilities
Other provisions are recognised where a present obligation (legal or constructive) to third parties
has been incurred as a result of a past event which can be estimated reliably and is likely to lead
to an outflow of resources,  and where the timing or amount is uncertain.  Other non-current
provisions are discounted if the effect of discounting is material. 
Accrued liabilities are liabilities to pay for goods or services that have been received or
supplied but have not been paid,  invoiced or formally agreed with the supplier,  including amounts
due to employees.  Here,  however,  the timing and amount of an outflow of resources is not
uncertain.

Financial assets
All purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade date.  Costs of purchases
include transaction costs.  If the fair value of available-for-sale financial assets (i, e.  non-derivative
financial assets which are not allocable under another category of IAS 39) can be measured
reliably,  they are subsequently carried at fair value.  Realised and unrealised gains and losses
arising from changes in the fair value of financial assets are included in the income statement
for the period in which they arise,  except for available-for-sale financial assets where unrealised
gains and losses are recognised in equity unless they are impaired. 
Borrowings and other liabilities
Borrowings and other liabilities are recognised at fair value using the 'effective interest method"net of transaction costs incurred.  In subsequent periods,  long-term borrowings are stated at
amortised cost using the 'effective interest method".  Any difference between proceeds (net of
transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the term
of the borrowing. 

The goodwill shown in the table under Other Asian Markets,  Western Europe and Other Cashgenerating Units is an aggregation of several cash-generating units,  as the goodwill of each
individual cash-generating unit is insignificant compared to the total amount of goodwill.  The
determination of the recoverable amounts of the cash-generating units aggregated under Other
Asian Markets as well as Western Europe is based on the same key parameter assumptions. 

Consolidated Financial Statements 

  Notes

Pensions and similar obligations
Provisions and expenses for pensions and similar obligations relate to the Group's obligations
for defined benefit and defined contribution plans.  Obligations under defined benefit plans are
determined separately for each plan by valuing the employee benefits accrued in return for their
service during the current and prior periods.  These benefit accruals are discounted to determine
their present value,  and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted in order to determine the net
liability.  The discount rate is set on the basis of yields at the balance sheet date for high-quality
corporate bonds.  Calculations are performed by qualified actuaries using the 'projected unit credit
method" in accordance with IAS 19 'Employee Benefits".  Obligations for contributions to defined
contribution plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred. 
In addition to recognising actuarial gains and losses in the income statement according to
the 'corridor method",  the amendment to IAS 19 issued in December 2004 grants the option to
immediately recognise actuarial gains and losses within equity.  As of January 1,  2005,  the Group
utilises this option in order to avoid earnings volatility and recognises actuarial gains or losses
for defined benefit plans arising during the financial year immediately in 'other reserves" within
equity,  as shown in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
Recognition of revenues
Sales are recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable,  net of returnstrade discounts and volume rebates,  when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the
goods are transferred to the buyer,  and when it is probable that the economic benefits associated
with the transaction will flow to the Group. 
Royalty and commission income is recognised based on the contract terms on an accrual
basis. 
Advertising and promotional expenditures
Production costs for media campaigns are included in prepaid expenses (other current and noncurrent assets) until the services are received,  and upon receipt expensed in full.  Significant media
buying costs are expensed over the intended duration of the broadcast. 
Promotional expenses that involve payments,  including one-time up-front payments for
promotional contracts,  are expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the agreement. 
Interest
Interest is recognised as income or expense as incurred (using the 'effective interest method")
with the exception of interest that is directly attributable to the acquisition,  construction or
production of a qualifying asset.  This interest is capitalised as part of the cost of the qualifying
asset.

  Consolidated Financial Statements 

  Notes 
Income taxes
Current income taxes are computed in accordance with the applicable taxation rules established in
the countries in which the Group operates. 
The Group computes deferred taxes for all temporary differences between the carrying
amount and the tax base of its assets and liabilities and tax loss carry-forwards.  As it is not
permitted to recognise a deferred tax liability for goodwill,  the Group does not compute any
deferred taxes thereon. 
Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences and tax loss carry-forwards
which exceed taxable temporary differences are only recognised to the extent that it is probable
that the company concerned will generate sufficient taxable income to realise the associated
benefit. 
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items
recognised directly in equity,  in which case it is recognised in equity. 
Equity compensation benefits
Stock options were granted to members of the Executive Board of adidas AG as well as to the
managing directors/senior vice presidents of its affiliated companies and to further senior
executives of the Group in connection with the Management Share Option Plan (MSOP) of
adidas AG see also Note 38.  For the final time in 2009,  the company had the choice to settle its
arising obligations by issuing new shares or providing the equivalent cash compensation.  The
company decided to issue new shares,  whereby the proceeds were credited net of any transaction
costs to share capital and capital surplus. 
In accordance with IFRS 2 'Share-based Payment",  an expense and a corresponding entry to
equity for equity-settled stock options is recorded. 
Estimation uncertainties and judgements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of assumptions
and estimates that affect reported amounts and related disclosures.  Although such estimates
are based on Management's best knowledge of current events and actions,  actual results may
ultimately differ from these estimates. 
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty
at the balance sheet date which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are outlined in the
respective Notes,  in particular goodwill see Note 12,  trademarks see Note 13,  other provisions
see Note 19,  pensions
see Note 23,  derivatives
see Note 28 as well as deferred taxes
see Note 33. 
Judgements have for instance been used in classifying leasing arrangements as well as in
determining valuation methods for intangible assets. 

Acquisition/disposal of subsidiaries as well as assets and liabilities

Pre-acquisition carrying amounts were based on applicable IFRS standards. 
The following valuation methods for the acquired assets were applied:
– Trademarks and other intangible assets: The 'multi-period-excess-earnings method" was used
for the valuation of patents.  The respective future excess cash flows were identified and adjusted
in order to eliminate all elements not associated with these assets.  Future cash flows were
measured on the basis of the expected sales by deducting variable and sales-related imputed
costs for the use of contributory assets.  Subsequently,  the outcome was discounted using the
appropriate discount rate and adding a tax amortisation benefit. 
The excess of the acquisition cost paid versus the net of the amounts of the fair values
assigned to all assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recognised as goodwill.  Any acquired
asset that did not meet the identification and recognition criteria for an asset was included in the
amount recognised as goodwill. 
The goodwill arising on this acquisition was allocated to the cash-generating unit adidas at
the time of the acquisition.  As part of the Group's reorganisation in the second half of 2009,  it has
been reallocated and is denominated in the local functional currency of the acquired entity see
also Note 2. 
If this acquisition had occurred on January 1,  2009,  total Group net sales would have been
€ 104 billion and net income would have been € 245 million for the year ending December 312009.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash at banks and on hand as well as short-term bank
deposits.  Short-term financial assets are only shown as cash and cash equivalents if they are
readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes
in value. 

Short-term financial assets

05

Short-term financial assets are classified at 'fair value through profit or loss".  Changes in the fair
value are recognised in the income statement as they occur. 
The majority of short-term financial assets are marketable securities relating to money

Assets/liabilities classified as held for sale

10

Part of the assets of GEV Grundstücksgesellschaft Herzogenaurach mbH & Co.  KG and of
Immobilieninvest und Betriebsgesellschaft Herzo-Base GmbH & Co.  KG are presented as
held for sale following a contract signed in 2010.  At December 31,  2010,  the disposal groups
contained assets amounting to € 30 million (2009: € 53 million).  The prior year amount includes
certain assets which have been reclassified to property,  plant and equipment due to a change in
conditions.  For 2009,  depreciation in the amount of € 0 million has been reflected for the assets
reclassified to property,  plant and equipment. 
In addition,  a warehouse in an amount of € 17 million in the Netherlands continues to be
presented as held for sale due to a new Memorandum of Understanding.  In 2010,  impairment
losses in the amount of € 6 million related to this warehouse were recognised in other operating
expenses. 
Due to a Memorandum of Understanding signed in 2009,  assets of € 51 million in the USA
were classified as held for sale as at December 31,  2009.  In 2010,  these have been reclassified to
property,  plant and equipment due to a change in conditions.  For 2009,  depreciation in the amount
of € 0 million has been reflected for the assets reclassified to property,  plant and equipment. 
At December 31,  2009,  the previous Reebok warehouse in the UK was classified as held for
sale as a result of the intention to sell and the existence of purchase offers (€ 2 million).  The
warehouse was sold in the third quarter of 2010.

€ 16 million for the years ending December 31,  2010 and 2009,  respectively see Note 30.  These
are related to assets within other equipment,  furniture and fittings,  mainly in the Group's
own-retail activities,  for which contrary to expectations there will be an insufficient flow of future
economic benefits.  In 2010,  reversals of impairment losses were recorded in an amount of
€ 7 million. 
In 2010,  assets amounting to € 80 million in connection with the unrealised sale of assets
see Note 10 were transferred from 'assets classified as held for sale" to 'land and buildings"
within property,  plant and equipment. 
The reclassified depreciation expenses consist of depreciation subsequently reflected see
also Note 10 and the formerly reclassified depreciation which has now been taken back. 
Contractual commitments for the acquisition of property,  plant and equipment mainly relate
to building projects in Herzogenaurach amounting to € 33 million.

The majority of goodwill which primarily relates to the acquisition of the Reebok business in 2006
is denominated in US dollars.  A positive currency translation effect of € 61 million and negative
€ 27 million was recorded for the years ending December 31,  2010 and 2009,  respectively. 
The Group determines whether goodwill impairment is necessary at least on an annual basis. 
This requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill
is allocated.  Estimating the value in use requires the Group to make an estimate of the expected
future cash flows from the cash-generating unit and also to choose a suitable discount rate in
order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.  There was no impairment expense for the
years ending December 31,  2010 and 2009. 
Future changes in expected cash flows and discount rates may lead to impairments of the
accounted goodwill in the future.  For details see Statement of Movements of Intangible and
Tangible Assets see Attachment I to these Notes.

At December 31,  2010,  trademarks,  mainly related to the acquisition of Reebok International Ltd. 
(USA) in 2006 and Ashworth,  Inc.  in 2008,  have indefinite useful lives.  This is due to the expectation
of permanent use of the acquired brand names. 
The Group tests at least on an annual basis whether trademarks with indefinite useful lives
are impaired.  This requires an estimation of the fair value less costs to sell of the trademarks. 
Estimating the fair value less costs to sell requires the Group to make an estimate of the expected
future brand-specific sales and appropriate arm's length notional royalty rates from the cashgenerating unit and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value
of those cash flows.  There was no impairment expense for the years ending December 31,  2010
and 2009. 
Future changes in expected cash flows and discount rates may lead to impairments of the
accounted trademarks in the future. 
Amortisation expenses for intangible assets with definite useful lives were € 55 million and
€ 66 million for the years ending December 31,  2010 and 2009,  respectively see also Note 30. 
Impairment losses amounted to € 11 million and € 19 million for the years ending December 312010 and 2009,  respectively see also Note 30.  These are related to distribution and licensing rightsfor which no future economic benefit exists.

Long-term financial assets

Long-term financial assets include a 97% investment in FC Bayern München AG (2009: 10%) of
€ 79 million (2009: € 79 million).  The percentage share held in the investment has decreased due
to the issuance of new shares which have been bought by another shareholder.  This investment is
classified as 'fair value through profit or loss" and recorded at fair value.  This equity security does
not have a quoted market price in an active market,  therefore existing contractual settlements
were used in order to calculate the fair value as at December 31,  2010.  Dividends are distributed
by FC Bayern München AG instead of regular interest payments. 
Additionally,  long-term financial assets include investments which are mainly invested in
insurance products and are measured at fair value,  as well as other financial assets.

Borrowings are denominated in a variety of currencies in which the Group conducts its business. 
The largest portions of effective gross borrowings (before liquidity swaps for cash management
purposes) as at December 31,  2010 are denominated in euros (2010: 55%; 2009: 61%) and
US dollars (2010: 40%; 2009: 33%). 
The weighted average interest rate on the Group's gross borrowings remained stable at 51%
in 2010 (2009: 52%). 
As at December 31,  2010,  the Group had cash credit lines and other long-term financing
arrangements totalling € 55 billion (2009: € 59 billion); thereof unused credit lines accounted
for € 39 billion (2009: € 41 billion).  In addition,  the Group had separate lines for the issuance of
letters of credit and guarantees in an amount of approximately € 03 billion (2009: € 04 billion). 
The Group's outstanding financings are unsecured and may include standard financial
covenants,  which are reviewed on a quarterly basis.  These covenants may include limits on the
disposal of fixed assets,  the maximum amount of debt secured by liens,  cross default provisions
and change of control.  In addition,  certain financial arrangements contain equity ratio covenantsminimum equity covenants as well as net loss covenants. 
As of December 31,  2010,  and December 31,  2009,  actual shareholders' equity was well above
the amount of the minimum equity covenant.  Likewise,  the relevant amount of net income clearly
exceeded net loss covenants.

Defined benefit plans
Given the diverse Group structure,  different defined benefit plans exist,  comprising a variety of
post-employment benefit arrangements.  The benefit plans generally provide payments in case of
death,  disability or retirement to former employees and their survivors.  The obligations arising
from defined benefit plans are partly covered by plan assets.

The asset ceiling effect arises from the German funded defined benefit plan and is recognised in
the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 

In the rest of the world,  the plan assets consist predominantly of insurance contracts,  with the
expected return based on the expected return on these insurance contracts. 

The determination of assets and liabilities for defined benefit plans is based upon statistical and
actuarial valuations.  In particular,  the present value of the defined benefit obligation is driven by
financial variables (such as the discount rates or future increases in salaries) and demographic
variables (such as mortality and employee turnover).  The actuarial assumptions may differ
significantly from the actual results,  i, e.  the present value of the actual future performance may
differ from the reported present value.

The actuarial assumptions as at the balance sheet date are used to determine the defined benefit
liability at that date and the pension expense for the upcoming financial year. 
The actuarial assumptions for withdrawal and mortality rates are based on statistical
information available in the various countries,  the latter for Germany on the Heubeck 2005 G
mortality tables. 
The Group recognises actuarial gains or losses arising in defined benefit plans during
the financial year immediately outside the income statement in the consolidated statement
of comprehensive income.  The actuarial losses recognised in this statement for 2010 amount
to € 13 million (2009: € 16 million).  The accumulated actuarial losses recognised amount to
€ 38 million (2009: € 25 million) see also Note 25. 
The expected return on plan assets assumption is set separately for the various benefit plans. 
Around 90% of the plan assets are related to plan assets in the UK,  Germany and Switzerland.  The
overall expected rate of return on assets is derived by aggregating the expected rate of return for
each asset class over the underlying asset allocation.  Historical markets are studied and expected
returns are based on widely accepted capital market principles. 
In the UK,  the assumed long-term rate of return on each asset class is assumed to be in
line with long-term government bonds,  with an additional investment return of 35% for equity
securities and 10% for corporate bonds. 
In Germany,  the plan assets are invested in insurance contracts and in a pension fund,  and
the expected return on assets is set equal to the expected return on the underlying insurance
contracts. 
The plan assets in Switzerland are held by a pension foundation and the expected rate of
return is calculated as a weighted average per asset class,  based on the investment strategy and
the expected return on the varying asset categories.

On December 31,  2009,  the nominal capital of adidas AG ('the company") amounted to
€ 209216186 divided into 209216186 no-par-value bearer shares and was fully paid in. 
On May 6,  2010,  the Annual General Meeting of the company resolved the conversion from
no-par-value bearer shares into registered no-par-value shares.  The corresponding amendments
to the Articles of Association were entered into the commercial register on July 13,  2010 and
thus became effective on the same date.  On October 11,  2010,  the no-par-value bearer shares of
the company were converted into registered no-par-value shares ('registered shares") see Our
Share,  p.  34. 
At the balance sheet date,  the nominal capital of the company amounted to a total of
€ 209216186 and was divided into 209216186 registered shares.  The nominal capital is fully
paid in. 
The nominal capital remained unchanged.  Consequently,  on February 15,  2011,  the nominal
capital of adidas AG amounts to € 209216186 and is divided into 209216186 registered shares. 
Each share grants one vote and is entitled to dividends starting from the beginning of the year
it was issued.  Treasury shares held directly or indirectly are not entitled to dividend payment in
accordance with § 71b German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz AktG).  As at February 152011,  the company does not hold any treasury shares. 

Authorised Capital
The Executive Board of adidas AG did not make use of the existing amounts of authorised capital
of up to € 95000000 in the 2010 financial year or in the period beyond the balance sheet date up
to and including February 15,  2011.  The following description of the existing authorised capital
does not contain the cancellation of the Authorised Capital 2006,  resolved by the Annual General
Meeting on May 6,  2010,  which had also not been made use of up to May 6,  2010. 
The authorised capital of the company,  which is set out in § 4 sections 2,  3 and 4 of the Articles
of Association as at the balance sheet date,  entitles the Executive Board,  subject to Supervisory
Board approval,  to increase the nominal capital

Repurchase of adidas AG shares
At the Annual General Meeting on May 6,  2010,  the shareholders of the company cancelled the
authorisation to repurchase adidas AG shares granted by the Annual General Meeting on May
7,  2009,  which had not been used.  At the same time,  the Annual General Meeting granted the
Executive Board a new authorisation to repurchase adidas AG shares up to an amount totalling
10% of the nominal capital until May 5,  2015.  The authorisation may be used by the company but
also by its subsidiaries or by third parties on account of the company or its subsidiaries or third
parties assigned by the company or one of its subsidiaries.  For further information see Disclosures
pursuant to § 315 Section 4 of the German Commercial Code,  p.  143. 
The authorisation was not utilised in the year under review and up to and including February
15,  2011. 

Contingent Capital
The following description of the Contingent Capital is based on § 4 section 5 of the Articles
of Association of the company as well as on the underlying resolutions of the Annual General
Meeting held on May 6,  2010.  Additional contingent capital does not exist. 
Contingent Capital 2010
At the balance sheet date,  the nominal capital is conditionally increased by up to € 36000000
divided into no more than 36000000 registered shares (Contingent Capital 2010).  The contingent
capital increase will be implemented only to the extent that holders or creditors of option or
conversion rights or the persons obligated to exercise option or conversion duties on bonds issued
by the company or a group company,  pursuant to the authorisation of the Executive Board granted
by the resolution adopted by the Annual General Meeting of May 6,  2010 up to May 5,  2015 and
guaranteed by the company,  exercise their option or conversion rights or,  if they are obliged to
exercise the option or conversion duties,  meet their obligations to exercise the warrant or convert
the bond,  or to the extent that the company exercises its rights to choose to deliver shares in the
company for the total amount or partially instead of a payment and insofar as no cash settlementtreasury shares or shares of another public-listed company are used to serve these rights.  The
new shares shall be issued at the respective option or conversion price to be established in
accordance with the aforementioned authorisation resolution.  The new shares shall carry dividend
rights from the commencement of the financial year in which the shares are issued.  The Executive
Board is authorised,  subject to Supervisory Board approval,  to stipulate any additional details
concerning the implementation of the contingent capital increase. 
The Executive Board of adidas AG did not issue any option or conversion rights,  or any shares
from the Contingent Capital 2010 in the 2010 financial year or in the period beyond the balance
sheet date up to and including February 15,  2011.

Capital management
The Group's policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to uphold investor,  creditor and
market confidence and to sustain future development of the business. 
The Group seeks to maintain a balance between a higher return on equity that might be
possible with higher levels of borrowings and the advantages and security afforded by a sound
capital position.  Following the achievement of the medium-term goal of financial leverage below
50% in 2009,  the Group aims to maintain net debt below two times EBITDA over the long term. 
Financial leverage is derived by dividing net borrowings (short- and long-term borrowings less
cash and cash equivalents as well as short-term financial assets) in an amount of € 221 million
(2009: € 917 million) by shareholders' equity in an amount of € 4616 billion (2009: € 3771 billion). 
EBITDA amounted to € 1159 billion for the fiscal year ending December 31,  2010 (2009:
€ 780 million).  The ratio between net borrowings and EBITDA amounted to 02 for the fiscal year
ending December 31,  2010 (2009: 12).

  Notes to the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position 
Reserves
Reserves within shareholders' equity are as follows:
– Capital reserve: comprises the paid premium for the issuance of share capital. 
– Cumulative translation adjustments: this reserve comprises all foreign currency differences
arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations. 
– Hedging reserve: comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value
of cash flow hedges related to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred as well as of hedges
of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. 
– Other reserves: comprise the cumulative net change of actuarial gains or losses and the asset
ceiling effect regarding defined benefit plans,  expenses recognised for share option plans as well
as fair values of available-for-sale financial assets. 
– Retained earnings: comprise the accumulated profits less dividends paid. 

Distributable profits and dividends
Distributable profits to shareholders are determined by reference to the retained earnings of
adidas AG and calculated under German Commercial Law. 
The dividend for 2009 was € 035 per share (total amount: € 73 million),  approved by the 2010
Annual General Meeting.  The Executive Board of adidas AG will propose to shareholders a dividend
payment of € 080 per dividend-entitled share for the year 2010 to be made from retained earnings
of € 368 million reported as at December 31,  2010.  The subsequent remaining amount will be
carried forward. 
209216186 dividend-entitled shares exist as at December 31,  2010,  which would lead to a
dividend payment of € 167 million. 

Finance leases
The Group also leases various premises for administration,  warehousing,  research and
development as well as production,  which are classified as finance leases. 
The net carrying amount of these assets of € 7 million and € 7 million was included in propertyplant and equipment as at December 31,  2010 and 2009,  respectively.  For the year ending
December 31,  2010,  interest expenses were € 1 million (2009: € 1 million) and depreciation
expenses were € 3 million (2009: € 1 million). 
The minimum lease payments under these contracts over their remaining terms up to 2016 and
their net present values are as follows:

This line item within equity comprises the non-controlling interests in several subsidiaries,  which
are not directly or indirectly attributable to adidas AG. 
Non-controlling interests are assigned to seven subsidiaries as at December 31,  2010 and 2009respectively see Shareholdings of adidas AG/Attachment II to these Notes.  These subsidiaries were partly
acquired in connection with the acquisition of Reebok and partly through purchases or foundations
in the last years. 
In compliance with IAS 32 'Financial Instruments: Presentation",  certain non-controlling interests
are not reported within non-controlling interests.  These include non-controlling interests of GEV
Grundstücksgesellschaft Herzogenaurach mbH & Co.  KG (Germany) as the company is a limited
partnership.  The fair value of these non-controlling interests is shown within other liabilities and
the result for these non-controlling interests is reported within financial expenses see Note 32. 

Leasing and service arrangements

27

Operating leases
The Group leases primarily retail stores as well as offices,  warehouses and equipment.  The
contracts regarding these leases with expiration dates of between one and fourteen years partly
include renewal options and escalation clauses.  Rent expenses,  which partly depend on net salesamounted to € 544 million and € 480 million for the years ending December 31,  2010 and 2009respectively. 
Future minimum lease payments for minimum lease durations on a nominal basis are as

  Consolidated Financial Statements 

  Notes 

Due to the short-term maturities of cash and cash equivalents,  short-term financial assetsaccounts receivable and payable as well as other current financial receivables and payables,  their
respective fair values approximate their carrying amount. 
The fair values of non-current financial assets and liabilities are estimated by discounting
expected future cash flows using current interest rates for debt of similar terms and remaining
maturities,  and adjusted by an adidas Group specific credit risk premium. 
Fair values of long-term financial assets classified as available-for-sale are based on quoted
market prices in an active market or are calculated as present values of expected future cash
flows. 
The fair values of forward contracts and currency options are determined on the basis of
market conditions at the balance sheet date.  The fair value of a currency option is determined
using generally accepted models to calculate option prices,  such as the 'Garman-Kohlhagenmodel".  The fair market value of an option is influenced not only by the remaining term of the
option,  but also by other determining factors such as the actual foreign exchange rate and the
volatility of the underlying foreign currency base.

Net gains or losses on financial assets or financial liabilities held for trading include the effects
from fair value measurements of the derivatives that are not part of a hedging relationship,  and
changes in the fair value of other financial instruments as well as interest payments which mainly
relate to investment funds. 
Net gains or losses on loans and receivables comprise mainly impairment losses and
reversals. 
Net gains or losses on financial liabilities measured at amortised cost include effects from
early settlement and reversals of accrued liabilities. 
The disclosures required by IFRS 7 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures",  paragraphs 31 – 42
('Nature and Extent of Risks arising from Financial Instruments"),  can be found in Note 6 and the
Group Management Report see Risk and Opportunity Report,  p.  158. 

Financial instruments for the hedging of foreign exchange risk
The adidas Group uses natural hedges and arranges forward contracts,  currency options and
currency swaps to protect against foreign exchange risk.  As at December 31,  2010,  the Group had
outstanding currency options with premiums paid totalling an amount of € 7 million (December
31,  2009: € 6 million).  The effective part of the currency hedges is directly recognised in hedging
reserves and the acquisition costs of secured inventories,  respectively,  and posted into the income
statement at the same time as the underlying secured transaction is recorded.  An amount of
€ 16 million (2009: € 4 million) for currency options and an amount of negative € 25 million (2009:
negative € 41 million) for forward contracts were recorded in hedging reserves.  Currency option
premiums impacted net income in the amount of € 4 million in 2010 (2009: € 4 million). 
The total time value of the currency options not being part of a hedge in an amount of
€ 1 million (2009: € 3 million) was recorded in the income statement in 2010.  Due to a change
in the exposure,  some of the currency hedges were terminated and consequently an amount of
negative € 3 million was reclassified from hedging reserves to the income statement. 
The total net amount of US dollar purchases related to product sourcing versus other
currencies was US $ 37 billion and US $ 37 billion in the years ending December 31,  2010 and
2009,  respectively. 
The notional amounts of all outstanding currency hedging instruments,  which are mainly
related to cash flow hedges,  are summarised in the following table:

 total net fair value of negative € 35 million (2009: negative € 57 million) for forward contracts
related to hedging instruments falling under hedge accounting as per definition of IAS 39
'Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement" was recorded in hedging reserve.  The
remaining net fair value of negative € 11 million (2009: € 5 million) mainly related to liquidity
swaps for cash management purposes and forward contracts hedging intercompany dividend
receivables was recorded in the income statement.  The total fair value of € 23 million (2009:
€ 10 million) for outstanding currency options related to cash flow hedges. 
The fair value adjustments of outstanding cash flow hedges for forecasted sales will be
reported in the income statement when the forecasted sales transactions are recorded.  The
vast majority of these transactions are forecasted to occur in 2011.  As at December 31,  2010inventories were adjusted by € 6 million (2009: € 4 million) which will be recognised in the income
statement in 2011. 
In hedging reserve,  an amount of negative € 3 million (2009: negative € 3 million) is included
for hedges of net investments in foreign entities.  This reserve will remain until the investment in
the foreign entity has been sold or the loan has been paid back. 
In order to determine the fair values of its derivatives that are not publicly traded,  the
adidas Group uses generally accepted quantitative financial models based on market conditions
prevailing at the balance sheet date. 
The fair values of the derivatives were determined applying the 'zero method".  The 'zero
method" is a theoretical model for the determination of forward rates based on deposit and swap
interest rates.  An alternative method is the 'par method" which uses actively traded forward
rates.  A comparison of the fair valuation based on the alternative methods revealed no substantive
differences.

The above summary for 2010 includes an interest rate swap in the amount of € 75 million (2009:
€ 79 million) which is classified as a fair value hedge pursuant to IAS 39.  The aim of this US dollar
interest rate swap was to obtain variable financing for a private placement in US dollars.  The total
positive fair value of € 8 million (2009: € 4 million) was offset by a total negative fair value change
in the hedged private placements in the amount of € 8 million (2009: negative € 4 million). 
The above summary further includes interest rate swaps in the nominal amount of € 150 million
(2009: € 279 million),  which are classified as cash flow hedges pursuant to IAS 39.  The goal of
these hedges is to protect future cash flows arising from private placements with variable interest
rates by generating synthetic fixed interest rate financing.  These interest rate swaps classified
as cash flow hedges had a positive fair value in the amount of € 0 million (2009: € 0 million) and
 negative fair value of € 6 million (2009: negative € 10 million).  The negative fair value change
of € 2 million (2009: negative € 7 million) for interest rate swaps which were classified as cash
flow hedges was booked in hedging reserves.  The amount that was reclassified from equity to the
income statement for the period was negative € 4 million (2009: negative € 4 million).  Interest
rate swaps classified as cash flow hedges in a nominal amount of € 45 million and € 105 million
secure variable interest payments arising from private placements with maturities in 2011 and
2012,  respectively.

as for logistics and central administration.  In addition,  they include impairment losses as well
as depreciation on tangible assets and amortisation on intangible assets,  with the exception of
depreciation and amortisation which is included in the cost of sales. 
Marketing working budget is the largest component of other operating expenses.  The
marketing working budget consists of promotion and communication spending such as promotion
contracts,  advertising,  events and other communication activities.  However,  it does not include
marketing overhead expenses,  which are presented in marketing overheads.  In 2010,  marketing
working budget accounted for approximately 26% (2009: 23%) of the total other operating
expenses. 
Expenses for central administration include the functions IT,  Finance,  Legal,  Human
Resources,  Facilities & Services as well as General Management. 
Depreciation and amortisation expense for tangible and intangible assets (excluding goodwill)
and impairment losses were € 263 million and € 299 million for the years ending December 312010 and 2009,  respectively.  Thereof,  € 3 million and € 5 million were recorded within the cost of
sales as they are directly attributable to the production costs of goods sold.

Income taxes

adidas AG and its German subsidiaries are subject to German corporate and trade taxes.  For
the years ending December 31,  2010 and 2009,  respectively,  the statutory corporate income tax
rate of 15% plus a surcharge of 55% thereon is applied to earnings.  The municipal trade tax is
approximately 116% of taxable income. 
For non-German subsidiaries,  deferred taxes are calculated based on tax rates that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the closing date. 

Deferred tax assets and liabilities
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if they relate to the same fiscal authority.  The
following deferred tax assets and liabilities,  determined after appropriate offsetting,  are presented

Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the realisation of the related benefit is
probable.  For the assessment of probability,  in addition to past performance and the respective
prospects for the foreseeable future,  appropriate tax structuring measures are also taken into
consideration. 
Deferred tax assets for which the realisation of the related tax benefits is not probable
increased on a currency-neutral basis from € 297 million to € 325 million for the year ending
December 31,  2010.  These amounts mainly relate to tax losses carried forward and unused
foreign tax credits of the US tax group.  The remaining unrecognised deferred tax assets relate to
subsidiaries operating in markets where the realisation of the related tax benefit is not considered
probable.

  Notes to the Consolidated Income Statement 
The Group does not recognise deferred tax liabilities for unremitted earnings of non-German
subsidiaries to the extent that they are expected to be permanently invested in international
operations.  These earnings,  the amount of which cannot be practicably computed,  could become
subject to additional tax if they were remitted as dividends or if the Group were to sell its
shareholdings in the subsidiaries.

The effective tax rate of the Group differs from an assumed tax rate of 30% for the year ending
December 31,  2010 as follows:

Earnings per share

34

Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net income attributable to shareholders by
the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. 
In 2009,  dilutive potential shares arose under the Management Share Option Plan (MSOP) of
adidas AG,  which was implemented in 1999.  As the required performance criteria for the exercise
of the stock options of all tranches of the share option plan were fulfilled in 2009,  dilutive potential
shares impacted the diluted earnings per share calculation for the year ending December 31,  2009
see Note 38. 
It was also necessary to include dilutive potential shares arising from the convertible bond
issuance in October 2003 in the calculation of diluted earnings per share of the 2009 financial year
until conversion as the required conversion criteria were fulfilled at the balance sheet date 2009
see Note 17.  During the financial year 2009,  the convertible bond was assumed to be converted
into ordinary shares and the net income is adjusted to eliminate the interest expense less the tax
effect. 
Following the full conversion of the Group's convertible bond in the fourth quarter of 2009 and
as no share options are outstanding anymore from the MSOP,  the Group had no dilutive potential
shares for the year ending December 31,  2010.

Segmental information

The Group operates predominantly in one industry segment the design,  distribution and
marketing of athletic and sports lifestyle products. 
Due to the Group's reorganisation in 2009,  the Group's internal management reporting has
changed.  The structure of the Group has been organised according to the two channels Wholesale
and Retail and a joint business model for adidas and Reebok has been established.  The reason for
the change in organisational structure is to leverage channel synergies across both the adidas and
Reebok brands as well as to facilitate the sharing of best practices and further alignment of brand
management to drive long-term sustainable growth.  Against this background and in accordance
with the definition of IFRS 8 'Operating Segments",  six operating segments have been identified:
Wholesale,  Retail,  TaylorMade-adidas Golf,  Rockport,  Reebok-CCM Hockey and Other Centrally
Managed Brands.  According to the criteria of IFRS 8 for reportable segments,  the business
segments Wholesale and Retail are reported separately while the remaining are aggregated under
Other Businesses due to their only subordinate materiality.  The reportable segments Wholesale
and Retail correspond with the presentation in the internal reporting. 
The adidas and Reebok brands are reported under the segments Wholesale,  Retail and Other
Centrally Managed Brands. 
The operating segment TaylorMade-adidas Golf contains the brands TaylorMade,  adidas Golf
and Ashworth. 
Rockport and Reebok-CCM Hockey were formerly part of the Reebok segment. 
Certain centralised Group functions do not meet the definition of IFRS 8 for a reportable
operating segment.  This includes functions such as central treasury,  global sourcing as well
as other headquarter departments.  Assets,  liabilities,  income and expenses relating to these
corporate functions are presented together with other non-allocable items and intersegment
eliminations in the reconciliations. 
The chief operating decision maker for the adidas Group has been defined as the joint
Executive Board of adidas AG. 
Information about the Group's segments,  in accordance with Management's internal reporting
structure,  is outlined below. 
There are no intersegment sales between the reportable segments.  Transactions between
the segments are based on the dealing-at-arm's-length principle.  Accounting policies applied for
reporting segmental information are the same as those used for the adidas Group as described in
Note 2. 

218 

  Consolidated Financial Statements 

  Notes 

  Notes Additional Information 
The results of the operating segments are reported in the line item "Segmental operating profit". 
This is defined as gross profit minus costs directly attributable to the segment or the group of
segments (primarily sales and logistics costs) before marketing working budget expenditures and
operating overhead costs not directly attributable. 
Segmental assets include accounts receivable and inventories.  Only these items are reported
to the chief operating decision maker on a regular basis.  Depreciation,  amortisation,  impairment
losses and reversals of impairment losses as well as capital expenditures for tangible and
intangible assets are part of the segmental reporting,  even though segmental assets do not
contain tangible and intangible assets.  Depreciation and amortisation as well as impairment
losses and reversals of impairment losses not directly attributable to a segment or a group of
segments are presented under HQ/Consolidation in the reconciliations. 
Segmental liabilities contain accounts payable from operating activities.  No other liability
items are reported regularly to the chief operating decision maker. 
Interest income and interest expenses as well as income taxes are not allocated to the
reportable segments and are not reported separately to the Executive Board of adidas AG. 
Following minor changes to the adidas Group's organisational structure in the first quarter
of 2010,  the assignment of certain functions has been changed compared to the consolidated
financial statements for the year ending December 31,  2009.  This development has a limited effect
on the Group segmental structure.  To ensure full comparability of Group financial results in 2010the Group has decided to adjust the segmental reporting for 2009 retrospectively.  While these
adjustments have no effect on total Group financial results,  results of the individual segments
have changed.  2009 Wholesale revenues now amount to € 7164 billion (instead of € 7174 billion
reported).  2009 Retail revenues remain unchanged at € 1906 billion.  Sales of Other Businesses
amount to € 1293 billion (instead of € 1283 billion reported).  Operating profit for 2009 now
amounts to € 2342 billion in the Wholesale segment (instead of € 2346 billion reported) and
€ 259 million in the Retail segment (instead of € 267 million reported).  Operating profit of Other
Businesses now amounts to € 283 million (instead of € 281 million reported).  2009 segmental
assets now amount to € 1938 billion in the Wholesale segment (instead of € 1943 billion
reported) and to € 420 million for Other Businesses (instead of € 415 million reported).  Segmental
liabilities for 2009 now amount to € 78 million for Other Businesses (instead of € 74 million
reported).  Capital expenditure of Other Businesses now amounts to € 23 million (instead of
€ 14 million reported).  In the consolidated financial statements for the year ending December 312010,  these adjustments have already been reflected in the 2009 comparison base.

In 2010,  the decrease in cash provided by operating activities compared to the prior year was
primarily due to increased receivables and inventories. 
Net cash outflow from investing activities was mainly related to spending for property,  plant
and equipment such as investments in the furnishing and fitting of stores in the Retail segment,  in
new office buildings and IT systems as well as the purchase of short-term financial assets. 
Cash outflows from financing activities were related to repayment of short-term borrowings
totalling € 198 million and dividends paid in an amount of € 73 million. 
In 2009,  the line item 'Acquisition of subsidiaries and other business units net of cash
acquired" in the consolidated statement of cash flows includes the acquisition of Life Sport Ltd. 
and Bones in Motion,  Inc.  see Note 3.

1) Due to the share split effective May 2006,  one option grants the right to purchase four shares.  Accordingly,  the share price information refers to four shares each. 

There were no stock options outstanding at the end of the years ending December 31,  2010 and
2009.  No stock options were issued during 2010. 
Stock options could only be exercised subject to the attainment of at least one of the following
performance objectives:
(1) Absolute Performance: During the period between the issuance and exercise of the stock
options,  the stock market price for the adidas AG share calculated upon the basis of the 'total
shareholder return approach" has increased by an annual average rate of at least 8%. 
(2) Relative Performance: During the same period,  the stock market price for the adidas AG share
must have developed by an annual average of 1% more favourably than the stock market prices of
 basket of global competitors of the adidas Group and in absolute terms may not have fallen. 

222 

  Consolidated Financial Statements 

  Notes 

  Notes Additional Information 
The stock options could only be exercised against payment of the exercise price.  The exercise price
corresponded to the arithmetical mean of the closing price of the adidas AG share over the last 20
trading days of the respective exercise period,  less a discount,  based on the extent to which the
share price at exercise exceeded the absolute and relative performance hurdles outlined above. 
In any case,  the exercise price was at least the lowest issue price as stated in § 9 section 1 of the
German Stock Corporation Act (AktG),  currently € 100 (i, e.  € 400 per option). 
Option terms and conditions stipulated that the stock options could have been used for existing
common shares in lieu of new shares from the contingent capital,  or in the place of common
shares the discount was paid in cash. 
The new shares participated in profits from the beginning of the year in which they were
issued.
