Herbert Hainer 
Chief Executive Officer 
   In 2011,  the adidas Group commenced its
five-year strategic business plan Route 2015. 
With currency-neutral sales growth of 13%earnings per share increasing 18% and a net
cash position of € 90 million at year-end,  the
Group has set off at a fast pace towards its
strategic goals.  As a result of this strong performance,  Management is proposing a dividend to
shareholders of € 100,  an increase of 25%. 

   Supported by major international sporting
events and an exciting product pipeline,  2012
is shaping up to be another record year for the
adidas Group. 
   In the following interview,  Herbert Haineradidas Group CEO,  reflects on 2011 and
discusses the Group's strategic and financial
outlook. 

  adidas Group 
2011 Annual Report 
  T o O u r S h a r e h o l d e r s 
012    Interview with the CEO

	

 ?

	

At the start of any strategic plan,  it is important to gain
momentum quickly and set a precedent by hitting targets.  In this
respect,  2011 certainly met my expectations,  and in most cases
exceeded them.  We enjoyed the Group's highest organic growth rate
since 2006,  as sales increased 13% currency-neutral.  This means
we added € 14 billion in revenues,  achieving over € 133 billion for
the year.  We also made strong bottom-line progress,  with earnings
per share growing 18% to a new record level of € 320.  And we ended
the year with our balance sheet in top shape,  with operating working
capital as a percentage of sales remaining at all-time lows of 208%and a net cash position of € 90 million.  All in all,  we have come out
of the blocks fast and are well on our way towards our 2015 strategic
goals. 
 !

	

 ?

Looking at the business,  which parts really stand out for you
in delivering this impressive growth?

  !	
What is most striking in our top-line development is the
broad-based growth we generated across all of our markets,  brands
and channels.  Clearly,  we were big winners in our three key attack
markets,  which accounted for more than 50% of the growth.  Currencyneutral sales in North America grew 15%,  Russia/CIS was up 26% and
Greater China increased 23%.  But an even greater achievement in my
opinion was our strong growth in Western Europe.  Revenues were up
10% in a region facing significant economic pressure.  This highlights
that,  in tough times,  the consumer and the customer gravitate towards
those brands that bring real and tangible value through innovation
and cutting-edge design.  On a segmental basis,  all of our segments
grew at a double-digit rate for the year.  A key highlight was Retailwhich generated comparable store sales growth of 14%,  a major
achievement following 11% comparable growth in the prior year.  That
says a lot about the great progress we are making on improving our
Retail operations. 

	
Looking at product categories,  we resonated with consumers
around the world in all categories.  Footwear sales were up 18%
currency-neutral,  with football and running each growing over 20%and outdoor growing almost 50%.  In apparel,  sales were up a solid
8% currency-neutral,  with growth in training and running more than
compensating for declines in football apparel due to high volumes
related to the FIFA World Cup in the prior year.  In hardware,  sales
were also exceptional for the year,  as TaylorMade-adidas Golf drove
the category up 10%.  Finally,  it goes without saying that,  once againadidas Sport Style was a major highlight,  adding almost half a billion
in sales as it grew 24% to over € 26 billion.  The global popularity of
adidas Originals as well as the expansion of the adidas NEO label in
the emerging markets drove this development. 

One of your key Route 2015 goals is to achieve an operating
margin of 11%.  In 2011,  your margins only modestly
increased.  Are you disappointed with that?

	
No,  quite the contrary,  when I look back at the year,  even
considering all the great top-line achievements,  our operating margin
development is one of the key financial highlights we are most proud of
for 2011.  As flagged several times over the past 18 months,  the severe
pricing pressure we faced in procuring our products due to record-high
raw material costs and wage inflation in our Asian sourcing markets
restricted our progress.  This eroded 23 percentage points of gross
margin in 2011,  and being able to limit the negative effect to a mere
30 basis points is no small feat.  And,  in some areas,  we were even
able to increase gross margins,  such as in Retail by 80 basis pointsand at Reebok by 40 basis points.  In terms of operating leverage,  we
delivered as we promised,  achieving a reduction in other operating
expenses as a percentage of sales of 70 basis points.  Therefore,  you
can take confidence from these results.  They show our ability to tackle
major challenges and they highlight the discipline we are instilling in
the organisation to leverage our cost base as we grow.

North America has been a major turnaround story for the
adidas brand.  But the jury is still out on whether you can
make this a long-term success.  What is your recipe to
succeed in the world's largest sporting goods market?

  !	
At the end of the day,  it's all about track record.  And this is what
we are creating.  With our Route 2015 plan for the US,  we are setting
up the right conditions for adidas to be successful in North America
long-term.  This includes being more focused in our choices,  consistent
in our execution,  and consequent with our follow-through once we
start an initiative.  Over the past two years,  we have concentrated our
efforts on a smaller number of key initiatives,  supporting them in the
right distribution channels and targeting our communication to attract
the next-generation consumer.  And the numbers are coming through
powerfully.  adidas brand sales in North America have increased
41% over the past two years,  the biggest jump we have achieved
as a management team,  with the 21% currency-neutral growth in
2011 being our best ever.  All of our key categories be it Originalsrunning,  basketball or training posted solid growth.  The shape of our
distribution mix is also evolving nicely,  with strong market share gains
in the high-quality mall and sporting goods channels as well as further
diversification with important directional accounts regionally.  When I
look at this,  our outstanding product pipeline and how the brand is
resonating with the consumer and our customers,  the consistency is
now where it needs to be.  You will see this again in 2012 as we push to
achieve a hat-trick of years of double-digit growth for adidas in North
America.

News flow from the local players suggests that the Chinese
market will be difficult in 2012.  What kind of visibility do
you have and do you expect momentum to continue?

has regained its touch at creating broad-based innovative and highly
attractive products.  However,  as we have learnt from our years of
brand-building with adidas,  while continuous innovation is the most
important ingredient for long-term sustainable brand success,  it
alone is not enough without a clear
consumer understanding of what
the brand truly represents.  And this
is where we turn our attention to for
Reebok in 2012. 

	
The
Chinese
consumer
is discerning and recognises the
innovation and quality of our brands
and products.  Furthermore,  we have
worked hard to keep retail channels
clean,  while at the same time
ranging a comprehensive offering
of our freshest and latest products. 
This is in contrast to many domestic
players who are facing challenges
from a lack of differentiation and
from over-inventories.  Additionallywe continue to build strong and close
relationships with our customers in
China,  which provide us with daily
or weekly feedback to coordinate
 faster and more efficient supply
chain.  Consequently,  from our order
book and the clear visibility on our
strong brand momentum in our
franchise store base of almost 7000I am fully confident in delivering
another year of double-digit growth in
line with our Route 2015 aspirations.

Reebok has seen momentum
slow and faces some
challenges with the end of the
NFL licence and the difficult
toning market.  What are
your priorities for continuing
progress for the brand in 2012?

  !	
We have brought Reebok
back on the map with three highly
successful commercial product hits EasyTone,  ZigTech and RealFlex. 
We can be proud of our achievements,  as sales have grown by more
than 20% and improved the gross margin by over 4 percentage points
since 2009.  While the toning market provided rapid growth early in this
period,  the fact that ZigTech and RealFlex have fully compensated for
the equally swift deceleration in the category highlights that Reebok 
	
Reebok's brand positioning
is about making fitness aspirational
and fun for everyone,  by providing
consumers with experiences that
are exciting and engaging.  To that
end,  we now have the right tools
in place to tell this message more
broadly and boldly.  It starts with the
introduction of a new global brand
campaign 'The Sport Of Fitness
Has Arrived".  Our partnership with
CrossFit is an integral part of this. 
CrossFit is one of the fastest-growing
fitness movements in the world and
involves a community passionate
about living a healthy lifestyle and
the camaraderie that can be found
in fitness.  With the support of the
CrossFit community,  we are aiming
to change the way people perceivedefine and experience fitnessempowering consumers to be fit for
life in a fun way.  This resonates in
 very real and authentic way with
the values of Reebok.  The campaign
will also be used to reinforce the
performance credentials of ZigTech
and RealFlex to sustain their
commercial success.  While the end
of the NFL licence and the transfer of
our US-related NHL business to the Reebok-CCM Hockey segment
will see Reebok sales decline in 2012,  the core of the Reebok brand
is expected to remain stable in this year of brand consolidation.  As we
begin building our fitness empire and continue our work in invigorating
Reebok Classics,  2012 will give us the platform to build a robust and
sustainable business as we go forward.

There is no doubt that the star player of the golf industry
in 2011 was TaylorMade-adidas Golf,  as sales broke through the
€ 1 billion barrier for the first time.  The speed and game-changing
impact of our innovation and technology launches over several years
has yielded clear market leadership in the sport.  Last year was no
exception.  The white R11 series of drivers were without doubt the
story of the year.  Not only did they change the colour of the game,  this
tuneable metalwood also catapulted our market share in the category
in the US to over 40% for a large part of the year.  In addition,  the R11
irons also helped us to sustain leadership in that category,  which we
now have held for over a year. 
 !

	
As I look forward,  we will use 2012 to secure these market
share wins and build on them further.  Already,  our latest revolutionsthe R11S and RocketBallz,  are shaping up to be retail hits as we
deliver on our promise to help golfers to increase ball speed,  distance
and accuracy.  Our success will also not just be limited to hard goods. 
In performance golf apparel,  we are adding an exciting new Fashion
Performance line,  which features bold colours and unique patternscombining our proven apparel technologies with contemporaryfashion-forward styling.  And with some other surprises in the bagwhich you will see later in the year,  our best days in golf are still
ahead. 

	

 ?

What kind of innovations have you planned for 2012particularly in light of the two major sporting events,  the
London 2012 Olympic Games and the UEFA EURO 2012?

  !	
There is always great product buzz and excitement around
major sports events.  When the sporting elite take centre stagethe pinnacle of adidas innovation accompanies them as they strive
to reach their personal impossible.  We wouldn't be adidas if we
didn't have something special for the major events.  Guided by our
five-pillared innovation approach faster,  cooler,  stronger,  smarter
and natural we will unveil new product and consumer experiences
like never seen before.  Building on our multi-category leadership in
lightweight technologies,  which are part of our faster pillar,  in 2012
we are going to fuse various elements of our other technology pillars
to create more holistic and exciting experiences for the consumer.  For
example,  in football and running,  you have already seen the beginning
of this through the introduction of the smarter element with our new 
SpeedCell technology and miCoach platform extensions in products
such as the adizero f50 miCoach and adizero Feather.  These
capabilities will be rolled out in other categories like basketballAmerican football and tennis this year.  In addition,  we are going to
bring revolutionary new products in natural motion,  extending the
adipure franchise we introduced in 2011 with the adipure trainer. 
This will start in the running category.  Over the course of three yearsour adidas Innovation Team has carried out extensive research and
testing to develop the adipure running range.  This is a collection of
three shoes with a variety of heel gradients that mimic the natural
movement of the foot,  by helping the body gradually adapt to the
demands of mid- to forefoot running.  Using 500 sensors located on
the bare foot,  our engineers have measured exactly where the foot
stretches on impact and where the maximum stress occurs.  On the
back of these findings,  we have created a new TechFit upper and
outsole.  These work as one to help the runner use their muscles more
effectively,  improving balance and flow without sacrificing stability,  for
 more natural running experience. 

	

 ?

Do you have any specific goals or targets for these events?

  !	
With the UEFA EURO 2012,  the clear target is to set new
record sales in the football category of more than € 15 billion. 
Here,  in particular,  our aim is to sustain the market share gains we
have enjoyed since the 2010 FIFA World Cup.  And we have all the
ammunition we need as the official sponsor and partner of the event
as well as six high-calibre teams in Spain,  Germany,  Russia,  UkraineDenmark and Greece. 

	
For the London 2012 Olympic Games,  we have specific
commercial targets mainly focused on increasing our exposure in the
UK.  As official partner to the London Organising Committee (LOCOG)only our branding will be visible at all the events and key Olympic
sites.  And,  for the first time,  we are selling the official products as
worn by the athletes on the field for Team GB,  designed together with
Stella McCartney.  However,  more important for us is ensuring the
Games live up to the spirit of what they are all about.  Here,  we are
fully embracing LOCOG's sustainability goals in terms of responsible
sourcing practices and product creation.  90% of all adidas products
for the Games will contain sustainable content.  100% of athlete Village
wear and Volunteer wear as well as 73% of on-field performance
products are designed and developed as 'Better Place",  adidas'
sustainable product creation programme.

Beyond your Olympic sustainability goals,  have you other
specific sustainability targets for the Group?

 ?

  !	
As part of our Environmental Strategy,  which is an integral
part of our overall Route 2015 strategic business plan,  we have
numerous programmes in place to use resources more efficiently. 
Like our consumers,  we are also concerned about the rate of natural
resource depletion and we have to push the boundaries to become
more efficient and environmentally benign.  Building on the Olympic
initiatives I just mentioned,  another great example on the product side
is our commitment to the Better Cotton Initiative,  which the adidas
Group co-founded.  Here,  adidas has committed to use 100% Better
Cotton by 2018,  which aims to improve the environmental impact in
the mainstream cotton industry.  In addition,  within our own operations
it is also our goal to reduce the emission of carbon dioxide by 30% by
2015,  the usage of paper by 50% and the usage of water by 20%.  There
is still a lot to be done and we are nowhere close to being 'there' yet. 
However,  our initiatives definitely show that we are actively working
on being more environmentally sustainable,  using resources more
efficiently and taking the next generation's needs into consideration
when doing business today. 

	

There is a lot of media excitement about the adidas
NEO label.  Can you tell us about your aspirations with
this sub-brand?

After looking closely at the market,  it was clear that there is
 younger consumer out there looking for fresh fashion options.  For
us,  this consumer is the 14- to 19-year-old global teen.  To step into
this market,  we created the adidas NEO label.  NEO means new.  New
by definition.  New in concept.  New in spirit.  It brings the heritage of
sport and translates that into fashion at an accessible price point for
teen consumers.  No other brand has the history,  credibility and style
to do this.  Like everything we do at adidas,  we offer these consumers
something special just for them,  with fashionable products grounded
in their likes,  dislikes,  trends and behaviours.  Looking at the size of
the fast-fashion market,  the sales potential is significant and our
aspiration is to create € 1 billion in sales from the adidas NEO label
over time.  This is why NEO is one of the selected growth projects of
Route 2015. 
 !

And how does your growing expertise in own retail play into
making adidas NEO a success?

  !	
It is critically important,  because this business will only be
successful in a controlled space environment.  Operationally,  the
adidas NEO label is something new for our Group.  This business model
requires additional capabilities in our supply chain to facilitate greater
in-season flexibility and responsiveness to changing trends.  We have
been working hard to build these skills and will comprehensively test
them this year.  In February,  we kicked off a pilot phase by opening
our first own-retail NEO store in Hamburg,  Germany.  We will open
ten altogether in Germany this year,  complementing our existing
NEO own-retail store base of 29 in Russia.  These new stores are
roughly 200 to 250m² in size.  In them,  new technology,  processes
and merchandising techniques,  including RFID (Radio Frequency
Identification),  will be leveraged to support and optimise daily product
delivery.  We will also engage the consumer with unique in-store
experiences like the Social Mirror,  where consumers can try on their
favourite NEO outfits,  take a picture or video and upload it to Facebook
or Twitter. 

 ?

	

 ?

	

	

Now that the adidas Group has achieved a net cash positiondoes this change your policies towards capital management
and dividends or other shareholder return opportunities?

  !	
Over the past three years,  through our ongoing focus on
improving cash flow,  we have reduced our net borrowings by
€ 23 billion.  This highlights the strength of our business model
and puts us in a great position to further support and invest in our
opportunities and growth initiatives.  With Route 2015,  we have a great
plan,  ambitious and realisable.  And executing on this will ultimately
yield superior returns for our shareholders in the long term.  In terms
of our approach towards capital management,  I see no reason to
change anything.  In fact,  the current economic climate only reinforces
our pursuit of conservative and cost-effective capital management
policies.  Nevertheless,  this still leaves plenty of room to continue
advancing direct shareholder returns.  And we are fully committed to
this.  For now,  our focus is on the annual dividend.  Here,  we have a
clear target to increase the payout ratio within our 20% to 40% target
range.  For 2011,  we intend to pay a dividend per share of € 100,  25%
more than last year,  representing an increase in the payout ratio of
17 percentage points to 312%.

execute our Route 2015 plan.  We expect sales to increase at a mid- to
high-single digit rate on a currency-neutral basis,  with growth in all
regions.  While gross margin pressures will persist,  particularly in the
first half,  we expect a similar gross margin compared to the prior year
at a level around 475%.  We will again leverage our operating cost base
and expect our operating margin to increase to a level approaching
8%.  And earnings per share will improve at a rate of 10% to 15% to a
level between € 352 and € 368. 

Herbert,  to sum up,  the title of this annual report is
'Together We Win".  What does this mean for you and the
adidas Group?

	
This statement really sums who we are: our attitude,  our
ambition,  our passion and the responsibility we have undertaken in
sport and society.  It's taking the ups with the downs,  never giving upand always striving for better.  From the time the first Olympians wore
Adi Dassler shoes in 1928 to today's age of real-time social engagement
this has not changed.  Our role as creator,  innovator and inspirer is
only made possible by our openness to serve the desires,  hopes and
dreams of millions of people.  On the pitch and on the street.  To be
there when great athletes do great things or simply take inspiration
from the energy and creativity of youth.  This is what pushes us to raise
our game every day.  It lives in everything we do: the boot with a brainCrossFit,  miCoach,  RocketBallz and our unwavering commitment to
being a responsible corporate citizen.  This is
life at the adidas Group.  It's a team effort,  and
it's all inclusive.  For me,  I am proud of our team
and I thank them for bringing this culture to
life.  We have accomplished so much in 2011and I am convinced their passion,  discipline and
dedication to succeed will continue our legacy
well into the future.  Together we win. 
 !

Herbert,  thank you for this interview.

Igor L and a u 
Chairman of the Supervisory Board 
Dear ShareholdersWe look back on an extremely successful year 2011.  Thanks to strong brands as well as innovative products
and marketing campaigns,  the Group was able to grow in all regions and to considerably improve its results.  The
sales and earnings guidance,  which the Executive Board had raised several times during the year,  was exceeded. 

Supervision and advice in dialogue with the Executive Board
In the past year,  we again regularly advised the Executive Board on the management of the company and
carefully and continuously supervised its activities.  In particular,  we examined the legality,  expediency and
regularity of the Executive Board's management. 
The Executive Board informed us regularly,  extensively and in a timely manner through oral and written reportsboth at Supervisory Board meetings and in the periods between our meetings.  This information covered the
Group's business policy as well as all relevant aspects of business planning,  including finance,  investment
and personnel planning.  We were also kept up-to-date on the course of business,  the operational position of
adidas AG and the Group (including the risk situation and risk management),  the Group's financial position and
profitability,  as well as all major decisions and business transactions. 
We were directly involved in all of the Group's fundamental decisions.  After in-depth consultation and
examination of the detailed information submitted to us by the Executive Board,  we approved transactions
requiring Supervisory Board approval. 
We held five Supervisory Board meetings in 2011,  and passed one written circular resolution.  In addition,  we
held a meeting in February 2012,  at which we discussed matters relating to the 2011 financial year.  Apart from
two meetings which,  in each case,  one member was not able to attend due to an urgent business appointment
that could not be postponed,  all Supervisory Board members attended all meetings in the year under review.  The
external auditor,  KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft (KPMG),  attended all meetings of the Supervisory
Board,  inasfar as they did not deal with Executive Board matters,  and all meetings of the Audit Committee.  In
addition to the meetings,  the Supervisory Board Chairman and the Audit Committee Chairman were informed
regularly in written and oral form on the current developments of the business situation and major business
transactions by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer.  The Executive Board regularly provided 
  adidas Group 
2011 Annual Report 
  T o O u r S h a r e h o l d e r s 
015    Supervisory Board Report 
us with very detailed reports for the preparation of our meetings.  We thus always had the opportunity to critically
analyse the reports and resolution proposals within the committees and the Supervisory Board as a wholeand to put forward any suggestions we might have had before resolving upon the Executive Board's resolution
proposals after in-depth examination and consultation.  These discussions did not give rise to any doubt as
to the legality,  expediency or regularity of the Executive Board's management in carrying out its duties.  The
consultations and examinations of the entire Supervisory Board focused on the following topics:

Transactions requiring Supervisory Board approval
In accordance with the Rules of Procedure of the Supervisory Board and Executive Board or statutory regulationscertain transactions and measures require Supervisory Board approval. 
In view of this requirement,  we resolved upon the budget and investment planning for the year under review and
the 2012 financial year following detailed presentations by the Executive Board and comprehensive discussions
at our meetings on February 9,  2011 and November 2,  2011,  taking into account risks and opportunities for the
Group.  At our February 9,  2011 meeting,  we furthermore dealt with the planned sale of real estate assets on
Herzo Base,  Germany,  as well as of some real estate companies founded in connection with this project,  and
approved these transactions.  The resolutions to be proposed to the Annual General Meeting were resolved upon
at our meeting on March 1,  2011. 
At our May 11,  2011 meeting,  we additionally considered the possibility of participating in a bidding process.  At
the same meeting,  we comprehensively discussed with the Executive Board a proposal to construct the Group's
largest distribution centre at the Niedersachsenpark near Osnabrueck,  Germany,  and subsequently approved
this project with a total investment sum of up to € 100 million.  The establishment of this distribution centre
will support the growth targets set out by the Executive Board as part of the Group's strategic business plan
Route 2015. 
At our Supervisory Board meeting held on November 2,  2011,  we intensively discussed the possibility of
acquiring Five Ten,  a leading brand in outdoor action sports and approved the acquisition based on the detailed
documentation and presentations.  This transaction underscores the adidas Group's potential to significantly
grow its presence in the outdoor category. 

Matters relating to the Executive Board
 key topic of our meetings on February 9,  2011 and March 1,  2011 was the determination of the variable
compensation components payable to the Executive Board for the 2010 financial year.  Following in-depth
discussions,  we resolved upon the General Committee's proposal on the 2010 Performance Bonus to be
granted to the Executive Board members.  Furthermore,  we discussed the General Committee's proposal
regarding the short-term targets relevant for granting the 2011 Performance Bonus as well as on the individual
Performance Bonus targets for 2011.  In line with the General Committee's recommendations,  when passing
the respective resolutions we took into account that the compensation incentive of the Performance Bonus Plan
shall not exceed the compensation incentive resulting from the sustainability-orientated variable compensation
component,  the LTIP 2009/2011. 
Having resolved at our meeting in May to reappoint Messrs.  Bennett and Stalker to the Executive Board,  we
reappointed Mr.  Stalker to the position of Labour Director at our November meeting.

The development of sales and earnings,  the employment situation as well as the financial position of the Group
and the business development of the individual markets were presented to us in detail by the Executive Board at
every Supervisory Board meeting following the close of the respective quarter and were subsequently discussed
together.  The KPMG-certified 2010 consolidated financial statements and annual financial statements including
the respective Management Reports,  as well as the Executive Board's proposal regarding the appropriation
of retained earnings,  were discussed and examined in the presence of the Executive Board and the auditor on
March 1,  2011.

As proposed by the General Committee and following in-depth discussions,  at our meeting on February 8,  2012
we resolved upon the amount of the 2011 Performance Bonus to be granted to each member of the Executive
Board based on the determined degree of individual target achievement.  Furthermore,  following in-depth
discussions,  we resolved upon the LTIP Bonus to be granted for the years 2009 to 2011 in view of the Executive
Board's outstanding target achievement.  Subsequently,  we discussed the General Committee's proposal
regarding the 2012 Performance Bonus Plan as well as regarding a new compensation plan with long-term
incentive effect covering the three-year period from 2012 to 2014.

Further information on compensation for the 2011 financial year can be found in the Compensation Report 
 see Compensation Report,  p.  50. 

Corporate Governance
Corporate Governance is always one of the focus points at our February meetings.  In this regard,  we dealt
extensively with the future composition of the Supervisory Board and determined specific objectives in
accordance with section 541 of the German Corporate Governance Code.  The current degree of internationality
of our Supervisory Board members,  which is vital for a successful,  globally operating company,  is to be
maintained to the current extent.  At the Supervisory Board elections taking place in 2014,  we intend to increase
the number of female Supervisory Board members from currently two to three women. 
Following in-depth consultation from and the recommendation of the Audit Committee,  which is also responsible
for corporate governance topics,  we issued the 2011 Declaration of Compliance in February 2011 and the 2012
Declaration of Compliance in February 2012.  The Declarations of Compliance were made permanently available
to shareholders on the corporate website at  :  www, adidas-Group, com/corporategovernance.  Further information on
corporate governance at the adidas Group can be found in the Corporate Governance Report including the
Declaration on Corporate Governance   see Corporate Governance Report including the Declaration on Corporate Governancep.  45.  At our meeting on May 11,  2011,  we dealt comprehensively with significant changes of law and jurisdiction
concerning 'Duties and responsibilities of Supervisory Board members".  With this presentation held by an
external consultant,  the Executive Board supported our individual training and further development measures. 
There are no direct consulting or other service relationships between the company and a member of the
Supervisory Board.  In 2011,  there was,  however,  a non-exclusive,  project-related consulting agreement with a
finance consultancy of which Dr.  Jentzsch is a partner.  The General Committee,  of which Dr.  Jentzsch is not a
member,  thoroughly examined the consulting agreement at its April meeting,  approving it before the consulting
agreement was signed.  For such cases,  the Supervisory Board has delegated the authority to examine and
approve to the General Committee.  The Chairman of the Supervisory Board then informed the Supervisory Board
of the decision at the Supervisory Board meeting held in May,  at which the project that was the object of the
consulting agreement was discussed in detail.  In order to avoid any conflicts of interest,  Dr.  Jentzsch excluded
himself from the discussion of and the decision on the project. 
Beyond this,  no conflicts of interest arose in 2011 in regard to the Supervisory Board and Executive Board
members. 
In preparation for the efficiency examination scheduled for this year,  we reviewed the efficiency of our activities
at our meeting held on November 2,  2011. 

Efficient committee work
In order to perform our tasks in an efficient manner,  we have five standing Supervisory Board committees and
also the project-related Committee for Real Estate Projects,  which was established ad hoc in 2009   see Supervisory
Board,  p.  38.  These committees not only have the task of preparing topics and resolutions of the Supervisory Boardthey also partly make decisions on behalf of the Supervisory Board. 
The committees' work in the year under review is summarised as follows:
– The Steering Committee,  which is authorised to pass resolutions on behalf of the entire Supervisory Board in
particularly urgent cases,  did not meet in the year under review.  All Supervisory Board resolutions were able to
be passed by the Supervisory Board as a whole. 

  adidas Group 
2011 Annual Report 
  T o O u r S h a r e h o l d e r s 
015    Supervisory Board Report 
– The General Committee,  which prepares the resolutions of the Supervisory Board on Executive Board related
matters,  held three meetings in 2011,  one of them by way of a conference call.  An additional meeting also dealing
with the variable compensation to be granted to the Executive Board for 2011 took place in February 2012. 

– The Audit Committee held five meetings in 2011,  and also one meeting in March 2012 dealing with topics
of the year under review.  The Chief Financial Officer and the auditor were present at these meetings.  The
committee members focused on the examination of the annual financial statements and the consolidated
financial statements for 2010 as well as the Management Reports,  an in-depth discussion of the audit reports
with the auditor and the detailed examination of the first half year report and quarterly financial reports prior
to publication.  Furthermore,  the Audit Committee obtained the required auditor's declaration of independence
and dealt with the proposal to the Supervisory Board recommending the selection of the auditor for the 2011
financial year.  Together with the auditor,  the Audit Committee established the priority topics for the audit of the
2011 annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements,  resolved upon the assignment of
the audit to the auditor as well as the audit fees,  and examined the independence of the auditor in accordance
with the provisions of the German Corporate Governance Code.  The Audit Committee obtained information on
the measures taken by the auditor to guarantee independence and assured itself that the auditor does not face
any conflicts of interest.  As in the previous year,  the meeting in September focused on the examination of the
effectiveness of the Group-wide risk management and internal control system as well as the internal audit
system and the compliance organisation.  In the course of this examination,  the members of the Audit Committee
were informed in detail on the applied methods and systems as well as on their efficiency,  through written
and oral reports.  In the course of the following detailed discussions,  inter alia with the auditor,  they assured
themselves of the effectiveness of the systems. 
The Audit Committee was informed regularly regarding current compliance cases.  At its November meeting,  it
dealt with the 2011 Internal Audit Report,  which did not detect any major infractions in business processes,  and
subsequently took note of the planning of Internal Audit for 2012. 
Furthermore,  the committee,  which is also responsible for matters relating to corporate governance in
accordance with the Rules of Procedure of the Supervisory Board,  discussed at its respective meetings in
February 2011 and November 2011 the contents of the Declaration of Compliance to be issued by the Supervisory
Board for 2010 and 2011. 
 The Mediation Committee established in accordance with the German Co-Determination Act
(Mitbestimmungsgesetz MitbestG) again had no reason to meet in 2011. 
 The same applies to the Nomination Committee. 
 The Committee for Real Estate Projects,  which had been established ad hoc in 2009,  also did not meet in 2011. 
The Chairmen of the committees reported to the Supervisory Board on the results of the meetings in a timely
and regular manner,  in oral and sometimes written form.

At its meetings on February 9,  2011 and February 8,  2012,  the committee discussed the resolution proposals
for the determination of the Performance Bonuses to be granted to each Executive Board member for the 2010
financial year and for the year under review,  respectively,  based on the determined degree of target achievement. 
Furthermore,  at its meeting on February 8,  2012,  the General Committee focused on the Executive Board's
achievement of the targets of the 2011 Performance Bonus and the LTIP Bonus 2009/2011 and developed
detailed resolution proposals to be presented to the Supervisory Board concerning the amounts of the 2011
Performance Bonus and LTIP Bonus 2009/2011.  Another topic of this meeting was the discussion on the 2012
Performance Bonus Plan as well as on a new compensation plan with long-term incentive effect,  effective
as of the 2012 financial year and covering the three-year period from 2012 to 2014.  In April 2011,  the General
Committee approved the conclusion of a non-exclusive,  project-related consulting agreement.

Examination of the adidas AG annual financial statements and
consolidated financial statements

44

KPMG audited the 2011 consolidated financial statements prepared by the Executive Board in accordance
with § 315a German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch HGB) in compliance with IFRS and issued an
unqualified opinion thereon.  The auditor also approved without qualification the 2011 annual financial statements
and the combined Management Report of adidas AG prepared in accordance with HGB requirements.  The
financial statements,  the proposal put forward by the Executive Board regarding the appropriation of retained
earnings and the auditor's reports were distributed to all Supervisory Board members by the Executive Board
in a timely manner.  We examined them in depth in the presence of the auditor at the Audit Committee meeting
held on March 2,  2012 and at the Supervisory Board's March 6,  2012 financial statements meeting during which
the Executive Board explained the financial statements in detail.  At both meetings,  the auditor reported the
material results of the audit with a focus on the priority topics of the year under review as agreed with the Audit
Committee and was available for questions and the provision of additional information.  The auditor did not report
any significant weaknesses with respect to the system for early risk detection and the internal control system. 
We also discussed with the Executive Board the proposal concerning the appropriation of retained earnings
with regard to the dividend policy and adopted it in light of the company's good financial situation as well as
the expectations of our shareholders.  Based on our own examinations of the annual financial statements and
consolidated financial statements,  we are convinced that there are no objections to be raised.  Following the
recommendation of the Audit Committee,  at our financial statements meeting we therefore approved the audit
results and the financial statements prepared by the Executive Board.  The annual financial statements of adidas
AG were thus approved. 

Expression of thanks
The Supervisory Board wishes to thank the Executive Board,  the management of the Group companies,  the
Works Council and all adidas Group employees for their tremendous personal dedication,  their performance and
their ongoing commitment which were decisive for achieving such excellent results.

Corporate Governance stands for responsible and transparent management and corporate control
orientated towards a sustainable increase in value.  These principles apply to all corporate functions
and are an essential foundation for sustainable corporate success.  We are convinced that good corporate
governance enhances the confidence placed in our Group by our shareholders,  business partnersemployees and the financial markets. 

The following report includes the Corporate Governance Report and
the Declaration on Corporate Governance issued by the Executive
Board and Supervisory Board. 

Dual board system
In accordance with statutory provisions,  adidas AG has a dual board
system,  which assigns the management of the company to the
Executive Board and advising and supervision of the Executive Board
to the Supervisory Board.  These two boards are strictly separated in
terms of membership and duties and responsibilities. 

Composition and working methods of the Executive Board
Our Executive Board consists of four members   see Executive Boardp.  34.  There are no Executive Board committees.  The Executive Board
is responsible for independently managing the company,  developing
the Group's strategic orientation,  agreeing this with the Supervisory
Board and ensuring its implementation.  Additionally,  the Executive
Board is responsible for establishing and monitoring an efficient
risk management system.  It is bound to the company's interests and
obligated to achieve a sustainable increase in company value. 
Irrespective of the Executive Board's overall responsibility,  its
members are individually responsible for managing their respective
business areas.  The CEO is responsible in particular for leading the
entire Executive Board as well as for management of the Group's
business policy.  In addition,  he is in charge of various fields such as
Global Sales,  Internal Audit and Social & Environmental Affairs as
well as Compliance.  The business areas Finance,  Global Brands and
Global Operations are each assigned to a different member of the
Executive Board.  The Rules of Procedure and the Business Allocation
Plan of the Executive Board set out the tasks and responsibilities of
the Executive Board.  These documents specifically stipulate requirements for meetings and resolutions as well as for cooperation with the
Supervisory Board. 
At the Supervisory Board meetings,  the Executive Board reports
in writing and orally on the agenda items and resolution proposals
and answers all questions from the individual Supervisory Board
members.  Furthermore,  the CEO discusses the Group's strategy and
business development with the Chairman of the Supervisory Board on
 regular basis.

Composition and working methods of the
Supervisory Board
Our Supervisory Board consists of six shareholder representatives
and six employee representatives in accordance with the German
Co-Determination Act (Mitbestimmungsgesetz MitbestG)   see
Supervisory Board,  p.  38.  The Supervisory Board currently has two female
members.  Five members of the Supervisory Board have many years
of international experience.  The composition of the Supervisory Board
is characterised by a high degree of diversity and comprehensive
knowledge of the industry resulting from the different professional
backgrounds of the members.  The members of our Supervisory Board
do not exercise directorship or similar positions or advisory tasks for
key competitors of the company.  With the exception of one already
expired project-related consulting agreement concluded between
the company and a financial consultancy,  which one Supervisory
Board member is a partner of,  they do not have business or personal
relations with adidas AG or the Executive Board   see Supervisory Board
Report,  p.  40. 
At its meeting held on February 9,  2011,  and in accordance with
the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Codethe Supervisory Board determined the following objectives for its
composition:
–  aintain the composition of the Supervisory Board including

members with international background to the current extent
–  aintain two female members on the Supervisory Board until the

next election of the Supervisory Board in 2014
– ncrease the degree of female representation on the Supervisory

Board as of the next election of shareholder representatives and

The chairmen of the committees report to the entire Supervisory
Board on the results of the committee work on a regular basis.  The
composition of the committees and their respective tasks can be found
on our website. 

In the 2011 financial year,  the composition of the Supervisory Board
did not change.  The present composition of the Supervisory Board
is in compliance with the aforementioned objectives.  An increase in
the percentage of female members is to be endeavoured at the next
regular Supervisory Board elections,  to be held at the Annual General
Meeting in 2014.  In selecting nominees,  further criteria that we
consider to be important for members of the Supervisory Board are
also taken into account,  such as 
expert and industry knowledge,  as
well as particular knowledge of and experience in applying accounting
principles and internal control systems. 

Apart from the tasks and responsibilities,  the Rules of Procedure of
the Supervisory Board and of the Audit Committee also set out the
individual requirements expected of the members and the procedure
for meetings and passing resolutions.  These Rules of Procedure are
available on our website.  The activities of the Supervisory Board and
its committees are outlined in the Supervisory Board Report   see
Supervisory Board Report,  p.  40. 

Irrespective of the consideration of these objectives and criteria,  the
best interests of the company will continue to play a decisive role
for the Supervisory Board when nominating candidates for election. 
The Nomination Committee was provided with the aforementioned
objectives that are to be taken into account when nominating
candidates.  The Supervisory Board also recommends that the
employee representatives consider the determined objectives,  while
observing the fundamental principles for the election of employee
representatives. 
The Supervisory Board supervises and advises the Executive Board in
matters relating to the management of the company.  The Executive
Board reports to the Supervisory Board regularly,  expeditiously and
comprehensively on business development and planning as well as
the risk situation and coordinates the strategy of the company and its
implementation with the Supervisory Board.  Moreover,  the Executive
Board provides the Supervisory Board with the annual financial statements of adidas AG and the annual consolidated financial statements
of the adidas Group for its approval,  taking into consideration the
auditor's reports.  Certain business transactions and measures of the
Executive Board are subject to Supervisory Board approval. 
In order to increase the efficiency of its work,  the Supervisory Board
has formed five permanent expert committees from within its
members,  which,  inter alia,  prepare its resolutions and,  in certain
cases,  pass resolutions on its behalf.  These committees are the
Steering Committee,  the General Committee,  the Audit Committeethe Mediation Committee in accordance with § 27 section 3 MitbestG
and the Nomination Committee.  In addition,  a committee responsible
for the handling of real estate matters was established ad hoc in 2009. 

The members of the Supervisory Board are individually responsible for
undertaking any necessary training and further education measures
required for their tasks.  The company supports the Supervisory Board
members by offering a professional training programme tailored to
the needs of the Supervisory Board,  informs the Supervisory Board
regularly about current legislative changes as well as opportunities
for external training,  and provides the Supervisory Board with relevant
specialist literature. 
Every two years,  the Supervisory Board examines the efficiency of
its work.  The last efficiency examination took place in 2010.  For the
first time,  an individual efficiency examination of the Audit Committee
was conducted.  The analysis of both examinations was carried out by
an external consultant.  The results were presented and discussed
at the Supervisory Board meeting in November 2010 and at the
Audit Committee meeting in February 2011,  respectively.  Based on
the discussion,  possibilities for improvement were debated whichhowever,  did not leave room for doubt concerning the efficiency of
either the Supervisory Board's or the Audit Committee's activities.  The
next efficiency examination is planned for 2012. 

Avoiding conflicts of interest
The members of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board disclose
any conflicts of interest to the Chairman of the Supervisory Board in
his capacity as Chairman of the General Committee without delay. 
The Supervisory Board reports any conflicts of interest,  as well as the
handling thereof,  to the Annual General Meeting.  Apart from the case
presented in the Supervisory Board Report,  neither the members of
the Executive Board nor the members of the Supervisory Board faced
any conflicts of interest in the year under review   See supervisory Board

016    Corporate Governance Report including the Declaration on Corporate Governance 
Declaration by the Executive Board and Supervisory Board of adidas AG
pursuant to § 161 German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz AktG)
on the German Corporate Governance Code 
The Executive Board and Supervisory Board of adidas AG declare that the recommendations of the 'Government Commission on the German
Corporate Governance Code" have been and are met with the following deviations:

Agreeing severance payment caps when concluding Executive Board service contracts
(section 423 subsection 4)
In accordance with the recommendations of the Code,  contracts with a term of more than three years provide for a severance payment cap.  We
believe that for contracts with a term of up to three years the short contractual term agreed in connection with further contractual provisions
offers sufficient protection from inappropriate severance payments.  Hence,  no formal severance payment cap is planned. 

Number of mandates of an Executive Board member (section 545 sentence 2)
In the past,  Chief Executive Officer Herbert Hainer has held four non-Group supervisory board or supervisory body mandates with similar
requirements.  With effect from February 28,  2011,  Herbert Hainer has resigned from his position at Engelhorn KGaA.  Consequently,  as of
March 1,  2011,  all Executive Board members meet the recommendation of the Code. 

Compensation of the Supervisory Board (section 546 subsection 2)
In order to ensure the independence of the Supervisory Board in their supervisory functions,  the members of the Supervisory Board do not
receive any performance-related compensation. 

Disclosure of the shares held by the individual members of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board
or financial instruments related thereto (section 66 sentence 1)
Insofar as no further statutory obligations exist,  we report the ownership of shares if it exceeds 1% of the shares issued by adidas AG,  but we
do not report this on an individual basis for the members of the Boards.  Instead,  we publish the total holdings of all members of the Executive
Board and all members of the Supervisory Board separately in order to safeguard the Board members' protectable interests.

the people living in these regions and for the environment as a whole. 
Compliance within the adidas Group: Our compliance system creates
the organisational requirements for Group-wide awareness of the
respective governing law as well as of our internal rules and guidelines and for ensuring their observance.  We perceive compliance as
being all-embracing and significant to the product cycle from the
supply chain to the final consumer. 
In order to ensure standardised and exemplary actions and behaviourin 2006 the adidas Group introduced a Code of Conduct which is
applicable in all regions and business areas.  Guidelines for day-to-day
behaviour in everyday work are stipulated in this Code.  The Code of
Conduct is available both on our website and on our intranet. 
The internal compliance programme based on the Code of Conduct
includes,  inter alia,  web-based training which is available to all
employees worldwide.  Furthermore,  on a global level we have
designated local compliance officers reporting directly to the Chief
Compliance Officer of the Group as contact persons,  to whom
complaints and information concerning possible compliance
infringements can be reported.  In the area of data protection,  we
have also established a web-based training programme for all
employees.  Additionally,  the Group has a 'Marketing Guide" to raise
our employees' awareness with regard to data protection when in
contact with customers.  Employees who work in sales receive regular
training concerning matters of competition law.  Before our products
are launched on the market,  our Intellectual Property department
researches the technologies,  trademarks,  logos and designs to
identify possible infringements of the rights of third parties.

Compensation Report 1)
For the adidas Group,  transparent and comprehensible reporting on the compensation of the Executive
Board and Supervisory Board are essential elements of good corporate governance.  In the following,  we
summarise the principles of the compensation system and outline the structure and level of Executive
Board and Supervisory Board compensation.  We also report on the benefits which the members of our
Executive Board will receive in case of resignation from office or retirement.

Compensation system for the Executive Board
Following preparation by the Supervisory Board's General Committeethe compensation system for our Executive Board and the total
compensation of each member of the Executive Board is determined
and regularly reviewed by the entire Supervisory Board.  The compensation system is geared towards creating an incentive for successfulsustainable corporate development. 
The compensation of the Executive Board members is designed
to reflect the size and global orientation of the Group as well as
its economic situation and prospects.  It aims to appropriately
remunerate exceptional performance,  while diminishing the overall
target compensation when targets are not met.  Finally,  the compensation is orientated towards the typical structure and level of executive
board compensation at comparable companies.  Taking into account
the compensation structure at the adidas Group,  the tasks and the
contribution of each Executive Board member to the Group's successhis individual performance as well as the performance of the entire
Executive Board are considered.  Thus,  an appropriate level of compensation can be ensured. 

Components of the compensation system
The target annual income of our Executive Board members consists
of a fixed compensation component amounting to around 35% and
 variable,  i, e.  performance-related,  compensation component
amounting to around 65% in the case of 100% target achievement.  The
individual compensation components are outlined as follows:
– ixed compensation consists of the contractually agreed,  nonF
performance-related annual salary that is paid in twelve monthly
instalments.  Its amount is fixed upon appointment to the Executive
Board,  and remains unchanged for three years. 
– ariable compensation consists of a Performance Bonus and a

compensation component with a long-term incentive effect (LTIP
Bonus),  which is based on the Long-Term Incentive Plan 2009/2011
(LTIP 2009/2011) measured over a three-year period.  The variable
compensation components are designed in such a way that the
incentive to achieve the sustainable targets set for granting the
LTIP Bonus is significantly higher than the incentive to achieve the
Performance Bonus.  Corresponding contractual provisions ensure
that this weighting will also be maintained in the future.  More than
50% of the variable target compensation component is based upon
multi-year performance criteria. 

The variable compensation components feature the following
criteria:
–  he Performance Bonus serves as compensation for the Executive

Board's performance in the past financial year in line with the
short-term development of the Group.  At the beginning of the
financial year,  the Supervisory Board determines the amount
of the Performance Bonus based on a target achievement of
100% (Bonus Target amount) for each member of the Executive
Board,  as well as the performance criteria with their respective
explicit targets.  As criteria for the 2011 Performance Bonusthe Supervisory Board determined both the business-related
criteria (increase of consolidated net income and of operating free
cash flow) as well as the Executive Board member's individual
performance.  The target achievement of business-related criteria
can be rated with a maximum of 150%.  At the end of the financial
year,  the Supervisory Board resolves upon a concrete bonus for
each Executive Board member depending on the respective degree
of target achievement. 
– The LTIP Bonus serves as compensation for the long-term performance of the Executive Board in line with corporate planning. 
When determining the LTIP 2009/2011,  the Supervisory Board
defined the following performance criteria with different
weightings:
– ncrease of consolidated net income

–  eduction of net debt (adjusted for non-operating effects)

– ncrease of sales growth with regard to the Reebok,  Rockport

and Reebok-CCM Hockey brands
–  bsolute and relative share price development

When calculating the LTIP Bonus payable following the three-year
period,  the weighted degrees of target achievement of the
performance criteria are accumulated and multiplied by the
individual LTIP target amount determined by the Supervisory
Board for each Executive Board member when the LTIP 2009/2011
was established.  The payout of the LTIP 2009/2011 is capped
at a maximum of 150% of the individual LTIP target amount.  If
the overall degree of target achievement lies below 50%,  the
Executive Board member is not entitled to the LTIP Bonus.  Once
the Supervisory Board has resolved upon the amount of the LTIP
Bonus to be granted to each Executive Board member,  the Bonus
will be paid upon approval of the 2011 annual financial statements.

In the case of premature termination of tenure by mutual consent
and without good cause,  the service contracts of Glenn BennettRobin J.  Stalker and Erich Stamminger do not provide for severance
payment caps due to the relatively short contractual terms of up to
three years; i, e.  a compensatory payment is made in the amount of
the payment claims for the remaining period of the service contract. 
The service contract of Herbert Hainer,  on the other hand,  which
has a contractual term of more than three years,  does provide for
 severance payment of a maximum of twice the overall annual
compensation (Severance Payment Cap),  limited to payment claims
for the remaining period of his service contract.  In this respectthe overall annual compensation means the overall compensation
paid to him,  as outlined in the compensation report,  for the last
full financial year prior to his resignation from the Executive Board
while considering the expected total compensation for the current
financial year.  If the service contract is terminated due to a change
of control,  a possible severance payment is limited to 150% of the
Severance Payment Cap.

termination of tenure

non-renewal of the service contract or termination due to reaching
retirement age,  the respective Executive Board member is entitled
to a follow-up bonus as individually agreed.  This bonus amounts
to 75% for Glenn Bennett,  100% for Robin J.  Stalker,  and 125%
each for Herbert Hainer and Erich Stamminger and is based on
the Perform­ nce Bonus granted to the respective Executive Board

member for the last full financial year.  The follow-up bonus is
payable in two tranches,  12 and 24 months following the end of the
contract.

In 2011,  international stock market performance varied considerably.  The sovereign debt crisis in the euro
area as well as a slowing global economic outlook were major concerns and catalysts for volatile markets
throughout the year.  The political unrest in the Middle East and Northern Africa as well as the devastating
earthquake and tsunami in Japan also weighed on financial markets.  As a result,  the DAX-30 and the MSCI
World Textiles,  Apparel & Luxury Goods Index decreased 15% and 4%,  respectively.  Due to consistently
strong financial results throughout 2011 and rising confidence in the adidas Group's strategic business
plan Route 2015,  the adidas AG share clearly outperformed both indices,  gaining 3% over the period. 
With further balance sheet improvements and the strong increase in the Group's net income attributable
to shareholders in 2011,  we intend to propose a 25% higher dividend compared to the prior year at our
2012 Annual General Meeting.

political unrest in the Middle East as well as the devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan weighed on investor sentiment towards
the end of the first quarter.  Despite headwinds,  particularly the
sharpening sovereign debt crisis in the euro area as well as rising
inflationary pressures,  international stock markets were resilient
during the second quarter.  This was mainly due to strong first quarter
corporate earnings and buoyant M&A activity.  In the third quarterhowever,  most international indices collapsed.  The DAX-30 declined
25%,  recording its highest quarterly loss since the third quarter of
2002,  which reflected the escalating sovereign debt crisis,  particularly in Greece,  Spain and Italy.  In addition,  the downgrade of the US
debt rating by Standard & Poor's at the beginning of August as well as
 slump in leading economic indicators added to intensifying recessionary fears and unsettled equity markets.  Following these massive
losses,  global stock markets recovered in the fourth quarter as the
instalment of new governments in Spain,  Greece and Italy increased
investor confidence in the ability of policymakers to resolve the
crisis.  Furthermore,  surprisingly robust US economic data provided
additional support.  Nevertheless,  signals of a slowdown of economic
growth in emerging economies,  particularly China,  growing concerns
with regard to the euro area's economic outlook and deteriorating
comments regarding corporate earnings led to volatile trading in the
final weeks of the year.

adidas AG share price outperforms market
Mixed international stock market development in 2011
In 2011,  the performance of international stock markets was mixedwith European and Asian indices suffering,  while US equities showed
resilience despite various negative headwinds.  The adidas AG share
price increased 3% in 2011,  clearly outperforming the DAX-30 and the
MSCI World Textiles,  Apparel & Luxury Goods Index,  which declined
15% and 4%,  respectively   Diagram 02.  The Dow Jones Index gained
6%.  At the beginning of the year,  positive news flow during the 2010
earnings season and improving economic data points from the USA
provided impetus for international stock markets.  However,  the 
Following significant gains in 2010,  the adidas AG share underperformed more cyclical companies at the beginning of 2011.  In additionrapid increases in raw material prices such as cotton put pressure
on the overall sporting goods and apparel industries.  However,  from
February onwards,  investor sentiment towards our share started to
improve amid more and more evidence of strong sales trends emerging
with athletic footwear and apparel retailers.  The adidas Group 2010
results publication as well as the increased revenue outlook for 2011
benefited the share price at the beginning of March.  The positive
trend,  however,  was reversed towards the end of the quarter following
the tragic events in Japan.  After trading sideways,  and in line with

During 2011,  the average daily trading volume of the adidas AG share on

unchanged at 12 million shares (2010: 12 million).  The average daily
trading volume of the adidas AG share on alternative trading systemssuch as CHI-X,  Turquoise and BATS Europe,  remained at a high level

the general market at the beginning of the second quarter,  positive
analyst previews with regard to our first quarter results provided
stimulus to our share.  As a result of better than expected top- and
bottom-line results,  the share price closed at a then all-time high
on May 5,  the day of the results release.  Throughout the rest of the
quarter,  several analyst upgrades and target price increases helped
to sustain positive momentum in an otherwise sluggish market,  which
also continued into the third quarter.  This resulted in the adidas AG
share reaching a new all-time high of € 5742 on July 15   Diagram 03. 
The first half year results as well as the more optimistic outlook for
2011 published in early August provided further support for our share
price in the following weeks.  While international indices declined
significantly,  the adidas AG share lost only slightly.  However,  during
September,  share price losses accelerated due to a lack of positive
stimuli.  At the beginning of the fourth quarter,  an Investor Field Trip
to Moscow aimed at providing further insights into one of our three
key attack markets Russia/CIS triggered a strong positive share
price develop­ ent.  The event strengthened analysts' confidence in

our ability to strengthen our dominant market position as well as to
achieve our Route 2015 targets in that market.  At the beginning of
November,  our third quarter results,  a further increase in our 2011
full year outlook as well as the publication of a sales and earnings
per share outlook for 2012 were well received by market participants. 
However,  in light of a generally weak market,  this did not provide
further stimulus to our share price towards the end of the year.  Nevertheless,  the adidas AG share closed 2011 at € 5026,  representing a
3% increase and a significant outperformance versus the market. 
This implies a market capitalisation of € 105 billion at the end of 2011
versus € 102 billion at the end of 2010   Diagram 04.

adidas AG share member of important indices
The adidas AG share is included in a variety of high-quality indices
around the world,  most importantly the DAX-30 and the MSCI World
Textiles,  Apparel & Luxury Goods Index.  The DAX-30 is a blue chip stock
market index consisting of the 30 major German companies trading
on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.  The MSCI World Textiles,  Apparel
& Luxury Goods Index comprises our Group's major competitors.  At
December 31,  2011,  our weighting in the DAX-30,  which is calculated
on the basis of free float market capitalisation and twelve-month share
turnover,  was 205% (2010: 169%).  Our higher weighting compared
to the prior year was mainly a result of the increase in the market
capitalisation of adidas AG,  which compares to declines of most other
companies included in the index.  Within the DAX-30,  we ranked 16
on market capitalisation (2010: 16) and 21 on turnover (2010: 23) at
year-end 2011.

Dividend proposal of € 100 per share

paying a dividend of € 100 to shareholders at the Annual General
Meeting (AGM) on May 10,  2012 (2010: € 080).  Subject to the meeting's

increase of 25% compared to an increase of net income attributable

net income attributable to shareholders.

The adidas Group strives to be the global leader in the sporting goods industry with brands built
upon a passion for sports and a sporting lifestyle.  Inspired by our heritage,  we know that a profound
understanding of the consumer and customer is essential to achieving this goal.  To anticipate and respond
to their needs,  we continuously strive to create a culture of innovation,  challenging ourselves to break
with convention and embrace change.  By harnessing this culture,  we push the boundaries of productsservices and processes to strengthen our competitiveness and maximise the Group's operational and
financial performance.  This,  in turn,  will drive long-term value creation for our shareholders.  To achieve
this goal,  we have made strategic choices and will prioritise our investments under our six key strategic
pillars   Diagram 01. 

Creating long-term shareholder value
Creating long-term value for our shareholders through significant
operating cash flow generation drives our overall decision-making
process   see Internal Group Management System,  p.  114.  Therefore,  we are
focused on rigorously managing those factors under our controlmaking strategic choices that will drive sustainable revenue and
earnings growth,  and ultimately operating cash flow.  Across our
operations,  we pursue the avenues for growth which we expect to
be most value-enhancing,  with particular emphasis on improving
Group profitability.  In addition,  rigorously managing working capital
and optimising our capital structure remain key priorities for us. 
Furthermore,  we are committed to increasing returns to shareholders
with above-industry-average share price performance and dividends 
 see Our Share,  p.  54. 

No matter in which market we operate,  we recognise that consumer
buying behaviour and the retail landscape are unique.  Therefore,  to
fully exploit market opportunities,  we tailor our distribution strategy to
present our brands to the consumer in the most impactful way.  This is
achieved by following a distinctive but coordinated channel approach. 
To this end,  we strive to provide our customers with superior service
to secure prime shelf space for our brands,  while continuing our
commitment to building a strategic competency in own retail and
e-commerce   see Global Sales Strategy,  p.  62. 

Creating a flexible supply chain 
Diverse brand portfolio 
Speed and agility are key to outpacing the competition.  We are
committed to meeting the full range of customer and consumer needs
by ensuring constant product availability in the correct size and colourproviding game-changing technical innovations and also the latest
high-end fashion products to the highest quality standards. 

Consumers want choice.  Whether it is the athlete looking for the
best possible equipment,  or the casual consumer searching for the
next fashion trend,  we are inspired to develop and create experiences that engage consumers in long-lasting relationships with our
brands.  To maximise our consumer reach,  we have embraced a multibrand strategy.  This approach allows us to tackle opportunities from
several perspectives,  as both a mass and a niche player,  providing
distinct and relevant products to a wide spectrum of consumers.  In
this way,  each brand is able to keep a unique identity and focus on
its core competencies,  while simultaneously providing our Group with
 broad product offering,  increasing our leverage in the marketplace 
 see Global Brands Strategy,  p.  68. 

 key strategic priority is to enable faster product creation and
production by continuously improving our infrastructure,  processes
and systems.  By sharing information from point of sale to source and
vice versa,  we strive to connect and more closely integrate the various
elements of our supply chain,  to enable quick reaction to changing
consumer trends.  To this end,  we focus on building maximum
flexibility.  While leveraging the efficiency of common infrastructure
and processes,  the Group strives to provide tailored solutions for
all our business models,  be it the wholesale or retail channels,  or
the performance-oriented or style-oriented businesses   see Global
Operations,  p.  90. 

Investments focused on highest-potential markets
and channels 
Leading through innovation 
As a Group,  we target leading market positions in all markets where
we compete.  However,  we have prioritised our investments based on
those markets which offer the best medium- to long-term growth
and profitability opportunities.  In this respect,  we place a considerable emphasis on expanding our activities in the emerging marketsparticularly China and Russia,  as well as building our market share
in underpenetrated markets for the Group such as the United States 
 see Subsequent Events and Outlook,  p.  163. 

Every adidas Group employee is responsible for driving innovation. 
Therefore,  we foster a culture of challenging convention and embracing
change,  and require all areas of the Group to generate at least one
new innovation or meaningful improvement per year.  In particularwe believe that technological evolution and cutting-edge design in
our products are essential to achieving sustainable leadership in
our industry   see Research and Development,  p.  95.  Beyond this,  enhancing
services for our customers,  and implementing more efficient and
effective internal processes are other areas where our organisation
strives to innovate   see Global Sales Strategy,  p.  62.

Becoming a sustainable company
Like any global business,  the adidas Group must manage wide-ranging
commercial and competitive pressure to deliver increased financial
returns and growth.  At the same time,  we are accountable for our
employees and have a high degree of responsibility towards the
workers in our suppliers' factories and also for the environment. 
We are committed to striking the balance between shareholder
interests and the needs and concerns of employees and workers,  and
the environment,  or,  in short,  to becoming a sustainable company

 more positive impact on society and the planet on our website at

Subsequently,  at the beginning of 2011,  we launched Driving Route
2015,  to act as a key enabler to reach our Route 2015 aspirations.  It
addresses solutions for optimising our organisational set-up as,  over
the years,  it has become too complex and inconsistent.  The objectives
of Driving Route 2015 are very clear: speed,  consistency and consumer
focus. 
–  peed by implementing a leaner organisation that allows faster

decision-making. 
– Consistency by establishing a more aligned and efficient organisation
across functions and geographies. 
–  onsumer focus by reducing internal complexity,  enabling us to put

more of our energy into what really matters the consumer. 

Route 2015 strategic business plan
In November 2010,  the Group unveiled its 2015 strategic business plan
named 'Route 2015",  which defines strategies and objectives for the
period up to 2015.  This plan is the most comprehensive the adidas
Group has ever developed,  incorporating all brands,  sales channels
and Group functions globally.  The key aspirations and targets of this
plan are set out in the section Subsequent Events and Outlook   see
Subsequent Events and Outlook,  p.  163,  and also in various other sections of this

Global Sales Strategy
The Global Sales function is responsible for the commercial activities of the adidas and Reebok brands. 
The function is organised in three distinctive channels Wholesale,  Retail and eCommerce.  By catering
to these three business models,  the Group aims to service multiple customer and consumer needs in
order to fully leverage brand potential,  be more responsive to market developments and manage channel
synergies by establishing best practices worldwide.

Global Sales defines strategic priorities until 2015
The Global Sales function directs all local market organisations
responsible for the distribution of the adidas and Reebok brands.  The
key priority of Global Sales is to design and implement state-of-theart commercial strategies that ultimately engage consumers with
rewarding point-of-sale experiences. 
As part of our Group-wide strategic business plan Route 2015,  the
Global Sales function has defined three strategic priorities:

–  ncrease the share of controlled space to 45% of Group sales by 2015

– mplement an Integrated Distribution Roadmap to ensure further
growth and maximise brand potential in key demographic locations

–  upport growth initiatives in the Group's three key 'attack" markets
North America,  Greater China and Russia/CIS

Integrated Distribution Roadmap (IDR) to increase brand
presence and market share
In order to increase our global brand presence and ensure further
growth of our business,  our Global Sales function has set up a comprehensive initiative called 'Integrated Distribution Roadmap".  The initiative encompasses a joint approach between our three channelsallowing us to define how best to capture the consumer in the biggest
and most attractive cities around the world without cannibalising
our brands and distribution mix.  The roadmap is designed to ensure
market share growth in underpenetrated affluent metropolitan areas
such as New York City,  where the IDR has helped us to clearly map out
several potential new locations for increasing our brands' presencewhich we are now beginning to execute upon. 

Focusing on three 'attack" markets
Focus on controlled space
Our brands must be competitive at the point of sale,  based on
availability,  convenience and breadth of product offering.  As a resultwe are continuously refining our distribution proposition with a strong
focus on controlled space. 

The Global Sales function has identified North America,  Greater ChinaRussia/CIS,  Latin America,  Japan and the UK as key growth markets 
 see Subsequent Events and Outlook,  p.  163.  Of these markets,  the three attack
markets North America,  Greater China and Russia/CIS are targeted
to contribute over 50% of the sales increase we anticipate as part of
Route 2015. 

Controlled space includes:
–  wn retail

– eCommerce 
–  ono-branded franchise stores

– Shop-in-shops 
–  oint ventures with retail partners

–  o-branded stores with sports organisations and other brands

These formats provide us with a high level of brand control,  as we
either manage the stores ourselves (i, e.  Retail and eCommerce) or
we work closely with our wholesale partners (e.g.  for mono-branded
franchise stores,  shop-in-shops,  joint ventures and co-branded
stores) to ensure the appropriate product offering and presentation at
the point of sale.  We intend to increase our controlled space initiatives
to 45% of Group sales by 2015 (2011: 36%).  This will mainly be driven
by growth in our Retail segment and the expansion of our own store
base as well as by growth initiatives within our Wholesale segmentsuch as the expansion of our franchise business. 

  adidas Group

  Group M a n a gemen t Report Our Group 
022    Global Sales Strategy    Wholesale Strategy 
Our most important third-party retail channels are sporting goods
chains,  department stores,  independent sporting goods retailer
buying groups,  lifestyle retail chains and e-tailers.  In this respectWholesale strives to establish strong partnerships with the most
dynamic retailers in their respective channel of distribution by offering
best-in-class and tailored services.  To achieve this,  Wholesale has
established the following principles   diagram 01 :
–  mplify our brands at the point of sale (POS) in all relevant channels

–  uild strong relationships with leading and most dynamic retailers

–  uild a highly motivated and highly skilled sales team

– mplement an industry-leading sales toolkit to drive sell-out

– eliver the benchmark in servicing retailers with world-class

efficiency
To reach our Route 2015 objectives,  we have identified several focus
areas,  built upon these principles. 

Retail Space Management to amplify our brands at POS
Retail Space Management (RSM) comprises all business models
helping our Global Sales function to expand controlled space in retail. 
Under the premise that the selling process is not finished until the
consumer has bought the product,  Wholesale is cooperating with
retailers along the entire supply chain to bring best-in-class service
all the way through to the point of sale.  By helping to increase profitability per square metre for the Group's retail partners as well as
improving product availability,  we can achieve higher customer satisfaction,  thus driving share of retail shelf space. 
The two predominant models to drive the success of RSM for the
adidas Group are Franchising and Never-out-of-stock (NOOS). 

01

− NOOS: The NOOS programme comprises a core range of basic
articles,  mostly on an 18- to 24-month life cycle,  that are selling
across all channels and markets.  Overall,  the NOOS replenishment
model secures high levels of product availability throughout the
season,  allowing for quick adaptation to demand patterns.  Retailers
have to provide dedicated retail space,  co-invest in fixtures and
fittings and commit to a 'first fill" representing about 25% of total
expected seasonal demand to participate in this programme.  In
return,  customers can profit from significantly reduced inventory risk
on these products.  Most NOOS articles are on an end-to-end supply
chain,  thus limiting the adidas Group's inventory risk and increasing
availability of products sold at best price as we re-produce based on
customer demand. 

Harmonisation and standardisation of processes to
exploit leverage
Wholesale is constantly working on further leveraging the size of our
Group and reducing complexity by implementing best operational
practices across our wholesale activities.  The harmonisation and
standardisation particularly of back-end processes can help to further
reduce cost through simplified IT systems and processes. 
Similarly,  we are rolling out a trade terms policy globally that rewards
customer performance either by higher efficiency (e.g.  in logistics)cost savings or better sell-out support (e.g.  by POS activation).  As
part of this effort,  we have established regular reporting,  delivering
meaningful benchmarks that allow us to tightly control our third-party
retail support activities.

The main strategic objective of the Wholesale channel is to deliver
profitable market share growth by becoming the leading sales
organisation in the sporting goods industry in terms of effectiveness
and efficiency.  To realise this,  Wholesale takes the go-to-market
strategies handed over by Global Brands and commercialises them
within a defined framework across various third-party retail channels. 

– Franchising: Mono-branded store franchising is one of the Group's
prime growth opportunities,  as it offers superior brand presentation
while limiting investment requirements and costs.  Franchise stores
are financed and operated by franchise partners.  The adidas Group
normally contributes to the costs for brand-specific fixtures and fittings
each store has to be equipped with.  Furthermore,  we support our
franchise partners with a comprehensive franchise concept,  including
range propositions,  merchandising,  training concepts,  and guidelines
for store building and store operations.  This ensures that the quality of
the brand presentation and the service offered to the consumer are at
all times high and comparable to our own-retail stores.

PEAK people development programme to build the best

64

When reaching for gold in business,  just like in sports,  the quality of the
team is critical to score as high as possible.  Therefore,  at the beginning
of 2012,  we will introduce a new programme for developing our
Wholesale sales organisation called PEAK (Performance,  ExcellenceActivation,  Knowledge).  The aim of the programme is to create the
foundation for an educated and enabled sales organisation.  To achieve
this,  we have defined competencies and capabilities required by our
sales employees in a functional competency framework.  With the
right competencies and skills in place,  our employees can follow
our sales-specific career development roadmaps.  In addition,  PEAK
also offers a guideline for desired behaviour and actions that support
our employees to become successful leaders in the Wholesale
organisation of the Group. 

Retail Strategy
Our vision for Retail is to become a top retailer by delivering healthysustainable growth with outstanding return on investment.  Retail
plays an increasingly important role for the future of our Group and
our brands,  and is a key driver on our Route 2015 journey.  The reasons
are manifold:
–  o showcase the breadth of our brands (e.g.  brand centres)

– o create distribution in markets which do not have traditional

wholesale structures
–  o grow another profitable distribution channel

–  o leverage our learnings from own retail for the entire organisation

–  o provide a clearance channel (i, e.  factory outlets)


02

Customer and range segmentation to exploit market
potential
Rolling out standardised product range packages around the globe
is an important part of the Group's Wholesale strategy.  The initiativewhich was first designed and implemented in Europe,  involves a
customer segmentation strategy that facilitates the systematic
allocation of differentiated product packages to groups of comparable
customers.  With 40000 different partners around the world that
operate more than 100000 points of sale,  this segmentation is broadly
based on a distinction between sports and lifestyle retailers that either
have an up-market 'brand-driven" positioning or a value-oriented
'commercial" positioning.  By best suiting their specific needsthis provides a platform to better exploit market potential,  while at
the same time supporting the reduction of complexity and costs.  In
addition,  Wholesale continues to partner with retailers on increasing
the level and quality of sell-through information the Group receives on
 regular basis.  This creates a mutually beneficial understanding of
their needs,  which helps us to become a more valuable and reliable
business partner.  At the same time,  this helps us to drive incremental
business opportunities and ensure a globally consistent distribution
logic. 

adidas
Brand Centre in Shanghai 
Over the past five to ten years,  the adidas Group has evolved into a
significant retailer,  operating 2401 stores for the adidas and Reebok
brands worldwide   see Retail Business Performance,  p.  140. 

Innovation key to accelerate speed to market
Accelerating product creation,  while reducing complexity is a key
element to gain competitive edge and,  ultimately,  to increase shelf
space at our customers.  We have therefore developed a virtual sell-in
tool which allows us to continuously offer a holistic sample range to
our retail partners.  This gives the customer the benefit of having a
'full range in his pocket".  The reduced amount of samples used during
the sell-in process as well as the streamlined image creation process
increases speed to market,  while at the same time saving costs.  This
new tool has already been introduced in several markets and product
categories and is targeted to cover 60% of all Wholesale pre-orders
by 2013. 

In order to simplify the shape of our store chain,  we have clustered it
into three different formats,  namely brand centres,  concept stores and
factory outlets. 
–  rand centres are large stores carrying the full range of each of our

adidas sub-brands under one roof.  They are the bold and powerful
statements about the adidas brand's strength,  breadth and depth. 
This format will be kept to a limited number and only in exclusive
locations such as New York,  Paris or Shanghai   Picture 02.

Focus on the consumer 
–  oncept stores are the commercial engine for sales and profit

across the Group's retail organisation,  upholding and accentuating
each brand's reputation.  There are adidas concept stores,  Originals
concept stores and Reebok concept stores. 
–  ur factory outlets facilitate the controlled sale of excess stock

returned from our wholesale key and field accounts,  franchise
partners,  own-retail stores as well as eCommerce.  The returned
stock is complemented with a portion of planned production which
creates a balanced product offering aimed at maximising profitability. 

To execute on these pillars,  the strategic priorities for Retail have
been broken down into the 'Five P's": People,  Product,  PremisesProcesses and Profit.

Reebok
Concept Store in Moscow 
The global strategic framework and guidelines for our own-retail
activities are led by a central team,  the 'franchisor" of the Group.  This
central team works closely with our market organisations to translate
the strategy into actions,  and drive commercial performance of our
adidas and Reebok retail operations around the globe. 
To become a world-class retailer,  four strategic pillars have been
defined   Diagram 03 :
–  ocus on the consumer

–  chieve operational excellence

–  xploit portfolio of brands

–  everage our global presence and scale

By focusing on these four strategic pillars,  we are confident to become
one of the top retailers in the world.  In line with our strategic business
plan Route 2015,  we will further invest in our own-retail activities and
will open up to 400 additional stores by 2015.  The majority of these
store openings are planned in the emerging markets,  particularly
Russia   Picture 04. 
In addition,  we will further roll out adidas Originals concept stores to
increase the number of distribution points for our lifestyle offering. 
Another area of focus in 2012 will be the further expansion of the
store base of the adidas NEO label,  the vertical business model for
the Group   see Global Brands Strategy,  p.  68.  Furthermore,  we will test new
single-category stores,  e.g.  running-specific stores,  as we develop our
store portfolio. 

People
The consumer and our employees are the primary reference points
in order to be successful.  One of the cornerstones of Route 2015 is
greater 'consumer focus",  an ambition Retail constantly strives
towards.  Within our stores,  we aim to interpret and adapt to changing
consumer demand,  targeting a mix of new and loyal consumerswhether it be sports-active,  sports-inspired or casual consumers. 
Therefore,  we are building a commercially- and consumer-minded
Retail back-office and field workforce that thinks and 'trades" like a
vertical retailer,  and whose highest priority is to serve the consumer. 
In 2010,  we introduced SHINE,  a Human Resources people strategyto leverage existing best practices and create a single global standard
for the field organisation.  This ensures a set of broad and deep vertical
retail and commercial skills to develop our staff globally.  During 2011the implementation and execution of SHINE throughout our markets
has progressed and we are more than halfway through completing
the global roll-out.  In addition,  we have also begun developing a
programme aimed at training our Retail back-office workforce in a
globally consistent manner,  which will be introduced over the next 12
to 18 months.

The key element of our product strategy in Retail is to ensure that
relevant products are presented through the Group's various retail
formats to match the intended consumer profile.  This requires a
product offering that is price-competitive,  simple to understand,  easy
to find and,  most importantly,  available at the right time and the right
place.  In 2010,  we kicked off a number of strategic initiatives in areas
such as product assortment and visual merchandising to achieve
this goal.  Correspondingly,  the depth of our trading analysis against
relevant KPIs has matured throughout 2011.  This has made us better
at displaying our products in the correct proportionality and in greater
depth for best-sellers,  ultimately leading to increased full-price
sell-through. 
Furthermore,  as part of a joint initiative of the Global Sales and Global
Brands functions,  we have defined a 'Global Foundation Range"which represents a set of products which must be sold through all
of our sales channels globally.  This increases the commonality of
products displayed throughout our 2401 concept stores and presents
 consistent message to the consumer. 

Our in-store operations are constantly being refined with the objective
of achieving flawless execution and operational excellence.  Visual
merchandising standards have been defined and manuals rolled
out globally,  and the creation of a global store operations manual
is progressing.  The establishment of common communications
procedures between our back-office teams and stores to ensure clear
and concise delivery of commercial guidelines and standards also
remain a key priority. 
Similarly,  supply chain enhancements have continued in 2011,  led by
the expansion of the adidas NEO label,  which requires a shift from
 sell-in push model to a more sell-through-driven pull model,  to
increase in-season flexibility,  be more responsive to changing trends
and,  ultimately,  compete in fast-fashion retailing.  In the long termleveraging best practices from applying a pull model will result in
economies of scale for the activities of the entire Group. 
While all of these activities will be ongoing in 2012,  Russia in particular
will be a key focus area with the transition to the globally defined
standard systems template. 

Premises 
Profit 
The start of a pleasant shopping experience is the store.  It is the
meeting point between the consumer and the brands.  Therefore,  it is
of highest importance that our retail environments are inspirationalathletic,  fun and interactive,  while at the same time being laid out
clearly and logically to make it easy to shop. 

Increasing the commerciality and profitability of the Group's existing
retail assets is the primary focus of all Retail teams,  particularly in
light of the pivotal role Retail has in achieving the adidas Group's Route
2015 targets.  As such,  we have introduced a set of operational KPIs
benchmarked to best-in-class retailers in order to measure existing
business performance and evaluate potential investments.  Stores
not achieving their required KPIs have been,  and will continue to beclosed down.  New stores must be supported by a business plan that
meets predefined criteria.  Each new store opening and remodelling
is closely monitored to ensure that the targeted profitability and
return on investment is accomplished.  In addition,  we will continue to
implement our people,  product,  premises and processes strategies in
order to maximise profit. 

In order to drive our sales per square metre,  Retail has set a clear
priority on optimising its real estate management process. 
Dedicated real estate teams have been set up who make sure that:
–  tore location and store size fit to the local market. 

–  he store is designed to maximise sales per square metre. 

–  arket share growth and increased market presence are in line with

our Integrated Distribution Roadmap,  which has been developed to
evaluate real estate locations in the top 100 cities globally,  based on
various factors such as consumer profile and competitive landscape. 

Processes
To enable the adidas Group to become one of the top retailers in the
world,  it is essential to have systems and processes in place that fit to
 retail business model.  Accordingly,  significant investments in retail
systems have been made over the past 12 months,  and global roll-out
of several of these is well underway.

At the beginning of 2010,  a leadership team was put in place to
define and outline the strategic direction of the Group's eCommerce
activities for the adidas and Reebok brands.  Although both brands
have made advances with their respective platforms in recent yearswe believe there is considerable untapped potential for the Group in
this distribution channel. 

accelerating our global expansion into new markets is at the top of
our agenda as we plan to add at least 10 additional markets globallyincluding Latin America,  where we intend to go live with our first
online shops in 2012.  In order to create one consumer destination,  we
will relaunch a new fully integrated brand and eCommerce platform in
Western Europe in the first half of 2012 as well as implement a stateof-the-art customised experience (mi adidas/miTeam) to further build
on our personalised interaction with the consumer. 

As part of Route 2015,  eCommerce has defined its strategic priorities
which include:

The success of our eCommerce strategy will rest on our ability to
attract,  convert and retain the consumer in a crowded marketplace.  To
attract the consumer,  we need to optimise the visibility of our site and
how it ranks in online searches. 
We also have to improve our management of paid placement and link
our own site to social media to attract larger numbers of the right type
of consumer.  To drive higher conversion rates,  we intend to simplify
and improve the functionality of our eCommerce platforms to create
best-in-class shopping experiences.  Finally,  to retain consumers we
will strive to create targeted communication as we gain a deeper
knowledge through improved CRM solutions that will allow for more
robust consumer interaction.  In this respect,  social media will play an
important role as it facilitates a deepening of the dialogue with our
consumers and a more evolving relationship with them   see Global
Brands Strategy,  p.  68. 

In summary,  with the strategic initiatives we have already kicked off
and which we will continue to build upon,  our eCommerce business
is well on track to achieve the target of € 500 million in sales by 2015. 

In 2011,  we made good progress on our eCommerce strategic priorities,  including the completion of establishing eCommerce as the third
sales channel.  In doing so,  we hired external expertise,  added young
and talented digital/online addicts,  and strengthened our leadership
both on a global and a market level.  Moreover,  in North America
we rolled out a new eCommerce platform built in-house that will
give us more flexibility and an improved consumer experience over
time   Picture 05.  In 2012,  we will integrate the Reebok brand onto the
same platform to leverage the benefits for both brands.  Similarly

Global Brands Strategy
Global Brands is responsible for all the product and marketing functions and long-term development of
the adidas and Reebok brands.  The primary objective of this portfolio strategy is to ensure that our brands
seize market and category opportunities through well-defined and coordinated go-to-market ­ trategies. 

Each brand is responsible for the execution of its strategic focus by creating a constant stream of
innovative and inspiring products and generating communication strategies that represent each brand
and category in an engaging and compelling way.

Driving the long-term development of
adidas and Reebok
To secure long-term sustainable growth for the Group,  Global Brands
is focused on driving the development of the adidas and Reebok
brands.  The overall strategic goal is to achieve qualitative,  sustainable
growth by building desirable brands in customers' and consumers'
perception.  Global Brands played a central role in the creation of
Route 2015,  the adidas Group's five-year strategic business plan that
was unveiled in 2010.  The adidas and Reebok brands are expected to
deliver 90% of the targeted growth for the Group in this period. 
Areas within adidas and Reebok that were identified as key contributors and game changers for the adidas Group include:
–  aining sales and market share in the key global categories running

and basketball with adidas Sport Performance
–  xpanding adidas Sport Style into fast fashion with the adidas

NEO label
–  stablishing Reebok as the leading fitness brand

–  eading the industry in the fields of customisation and interactivity

across categories
In addition,  Global Brands is also playing a key role in our Driving
Route 2015 programme,  which is focused on speed,  consistency and
consumer focus.  Among other things,  we are striving to present adidas
and Reebok in a more consistent way around the world in terms of
ranges and pricing.  In the long term,  this should lead to range size
efficiencies and gross margin optimisation.  One example of this is the
creation of a 'Global Foundation Range",  which will be mandatory for
all of our markets and channels. 

Focus on the consumer
The consumer is at the heart of everything we do.  This is the first
and most important realisation,  and we must adhere to it to deliver
long-term success.  As part of its function,  Global Brands has mapped
out our target consumer universe,  which spans from our roots in
sport,  the 'pure performer",  through to today's style setters who have
embraced sporting goods brands   Diagram 01. 
To be successful across consumer segments,  we acknowledge that
 strategy of mass production or mass marketing is no longer sufficient.  Only by identifying and understanding consumers' buying habitstheir fitness level,  their motivations and goals for doing sport and their 
individual lifestyle,  can we create meaningful products,  services and
experiences that build a lasting impression.  In this respect,  we have
identified five key global trends which will be important to address
with our brands and sub-brands over the duration of Route 2015:
– Fit for life: Sport is no longer just about competing and winning. 
Sport is becoming more embedded in consumers' everyday lifestyles. 
Motivations and goals are becoming more holistic,  relating to funsocialising and quality of life. 
– You are what you know and what you do: Society is embracing a
life-long learning attitude,  and placing more emphasis on what we
know and do versus what we have and where we come from. 
– Celebrating individuality: Consumers increasingly fulfil their desire
to differentiate from one another by being more creative on the one
hand mixing and matching products and services they need,  and on
the other hand seeking personalised offerings tailored for them. 
– 
Together is better: There is an increasing need for meaningful
social interaction,  both online and offline,  as consumers become more
mobile,  and the rise of digital technologies makes it easier for them to
connect with like-minded people. 
– Back to basics: For everyday life,  products and services are desired
to be simple and authentic,  making consumers' lives easier,  rather
than more complicated.  There is a growing interest in outdoor activities,  reflecting the desire to reconnect and be in tune with nature. 

To match these trends and fulfil consumer demands,  Global Brands
teams adhere to the following principles:
–  reate the unexpected in terms of product and brand experience

–  reate the highest emotional connection between our brands and

the consumer
–  e prepared for the next generation,  anticipating change

–  implify to the maximum

–  how excellence in execution,  being consistent in whatever we doS
from idea creation to communication at the point of sale,  and in the
digital world

023    Global Brands Strategy 
As a true global brand with German roots,  adidas is targeting competitive sports based on innovation and technology with adidas Sport
Performance.  This sub-brand is the multi-sport specialist.  Our
positioning in this respect clearly starts in producing the best products
for use in specific sports such as football,  basketball and running.  We
then seek to leverage brand loyalty and strength in innovation in other
categories.  The other sub-brands,  adidas Originals and Sport Stylestrive to take the brand's unique heritage and design leadership to
capture further potential in sports lifestyle and fashion markets. 
Reebok,  in contrast,  is an American-inspired global brand,  starting
with fitness as the backbone for the brand's global positioning.  With
Reebok,  we aspire to make our consumers 'fit for life".  Innovation
at the brand is rooted in developing technologies and concepts that
enable consumers to train at their best every day,  whether they are 
01

running to keep fit,  exercising in the gym or participating in other
fitness activities.  Reebok Classics leverages the fitness attitude and
roots of the brand into the lifestyle segment.  Reebok thus focuses
in-between the two ends of the consumer spectrum   Diagram 01. 
Through these differences in positioning,  our brands are therefore not
cannibalising each other in the market,  but rather challenging and
supporting each other as friendly competitors with different target
groups in mind. 
Each brand and sub-brand is responsible for bringing its respective
positioning to life,  through the creation of products and communications that not only support the commercial functions in their day-today business activities,  but also provide the platform and framework
for long-term market share and profitability improvements.  While
adidas and Reebok each have unique identities,  heritages,  technologies,  designs and reputations,  the strategic principles and methods
for driving future sales growth and profitability improvements are
common to both.  These include:
– Leadership in product innovation to excite and inspire the consumer
– Marketing and communication leadership
– Activation and validation via a relevant set of promotion partnerships
– Extending brand reach and appeal through strategic partnerships

Leadership in product innovation to excite
and inspire the consumer
Through Global Brands,  we are determined to address every consumer
in a specific and unique way with product initiatives that generate
trade and consumer interest. 

20

70

We believe that technological innovation is essential to sustainable
leadership in our industry.  By leveraging the extensive R&D expertise
within the Group,  adidas and Reebok continuously challenge the
boundaries of functionality and performance.  In addition,  innovation
plays a significant role in differentiating the adidas and Reebok
product offerings in the minds of consumers. 
For example,  at adidas,  personalisation is one of the brand's lead
innovation concepts,  and it is an adidas goal to be the most personal
sports brand by 2015.  At Reebok,  innovation focus is on fitness,  where
the priority is creating products that provide a material benefit to the
consumer's fitness activities (e.g.  flexibility,  lightweight)   see Research
and Development,  p.  95. 
By creating inspiring product and brand experiences,  adidas and
Reebok strive to enhance their positions as premium brands.  This,  in
turn,  is an important catalyst to sustaining and improving the brands'
gross margins,  therefore making continuous innovation an important
enabler for future profitability improvements. 

Marketing and communication leadership
To be competitive in the sporting goods industry,  brands must have
 clear profile towards their target consumer.  To achieve this,  adidas
and Reebok are focused on creating inspirational and innovative brand
marketing campaigns and developing communication techniques
that build brand equity and support the achievement of the Group's
commercial goals. 
 key tenet of our marketing and communication strategy is to harness
the emotion of sport and the benefits of a sporting lifestyle across all
communication channels.  Both adidas and Reebok regularly bring
new global marketing concepts to life,  which can be easily leveraged
to create simple and powerful brand messages and support an array
of product offerings.  For example,  in 2011,  the 'all adidas" campaign
brought together the diversity of the adidas brand,  transcending all
key categories and sub-brands,  in the biggest marketing campaign 
the brand has ever executed.  It reached an estimated 370 million
people,  or 80% of next-generation consumers.  In 2012,  the campaign
continues and will leverage the brand's assets,  product initiatives and
major sporting events locally,  globally and across categories,  with a
key goal of amplifying our impact on the consumer through social
media engagement.  In 2012,  Reebok will begin to declare the brand's
ambition to bring the 'Sport of Fitness" to consumers around the
world.  Through a comprehensive campaign that will run throughout
the year,  the Reebok brand will show consumers how the competitionjoy and camaraderie found in traditional sports can be discovered in
fitness as well. 
In addition,  Global Brands also endeavours to ensure all of its brands
are at the forefront of new communication techniques,  particularly as
information flow becomes faster and faster.  To increase the pace and
relevance of our brands' communication with the consumer,  digital
marketing now acts as a backbone for all brand marketing activities.  Whether through in-store or online customisation platformsdigital social networks,  mobile apps or digital broadcast mediumsthese methods are providing a new scope of consumer experiences
in a real-time and cost-efficient way.  With consumers spending more
time online,  the adidas and Reebok digital strategies allow the brands
to move from campaign-based communication to developing deeper
relationships with their respective target audience.  In addition to
adding significant value to all our communication efforts,  our digital
marketing and social interaction with consumers also provide the
brands with accessible insights,  learnings and measurable resultswhich in turn can be utilised to drive long-term brand equity. 

Activation and validation via a relevant set of
promotion partnerships
The utilisation of promotion partners such as federations,  teamsleagues,  events and individuals is an important part of endorsing
brand positioning,  and an area to which the Group dedicates significant resources.  This not only serves as a vehicle to showcase the
credentials of adidas and Reebok products in the performance arenabut also to facilitate the extension of the adidas and Reebok brands in
the sports-inspired lifestyle market.  Both adidas and Reebok follow a
partnership strategy geared to best reflect their respective positioning
in the market.

repositioning in Classics,  Reebok also began a multi-faceted
partnership with platinum music producer Swizz Beatz in 2011collaborating on a wide range of creative content in the realms of
dance,  music,  art and style.

adidas the performance brand and
multi-sport specialist
adidas' mission is to be the leading sports brand in the world.  One
major lever to achieve this is the brand's broad and unique product
portfolio spanning from apparel and footwear for professional athletes
to premium fashion.  It allows adidas to address multiple consumer
needs,  exploit market opportunities from various angles as well as be
less affected by one-dimensional market risks.  adidas' commitment
to product innovation and its rich heritage differentiates the brand
from competitors and provides a solid platform for future growth. 

No other brand has a more distinguished history or stronger
connection with sport than adidas.  adidas is everywhere where the
best meet the best,  like the FIFA World Cup or the Olympic Gamesbut also everywhere else around the globe where sports are simply
played,  watched,  enjoyed and celebrated. 
Everything at adidas Sport Performance reflects the spirit of our
founder,  Adi Dassler.  The main objective is simple: make athletes
better.  Therefore,  innovation is at the core of all adidas Sport
­Performance products. 
The target consumers of the sub-brand are clearly those consumers
who call themselves athletes,  are active in sport,  or simply are inspired
by and love sport. 
While adidas has a pivotal strength with the 20- to 29-year-olds,  a
clear focus of the brand is on strengthening its resonance with the
high school athlete and 14- to 19-year-olds. 
adidas Sport Performance offers products in most sports categories. 
The key focus categories are:
– Football
– Basketball
– Running
– Training
– Outdoor
adidas,  as 'the" multi-sport specialist within the industry,  also
supports a wide range of other sports,  e.g.  American football,  rugbytennis,  baseball,  handball,  badminton,  table tennis,  boxing and
wrestling.  During 2011,  the brand had a highly successful Rugby World
Cup,  with 43% of players wearing adidas boots and with the winning
team,  the adidas endorsed All Blacks of New Zealand.  In 2012,  the
Summer Olympic Games in London are clearly a key platform for
the brand to launch new innovations and demonstrate again adidas'
leadership across virtually all sports.  At these Games,  adidas will
supply products for 25 of the 26 Olympic sports. 
Furthermore,  adidas Sport Performance focuses on interactive and
customisation as key growth drivers across categories.  A perfect
example of this is adidas miCoach,  which is the world's first web-based
personalised training service.  It combines state-of-the-art training
with a personalised web service and real-time audio coaching. 
In 2011,  the miCoach offer was expanded with the introduction of
the revolutionary speed cell.  With the miCoach SpeedCell,  athletes
of every level are able to track their unique stats including average
speed,  maximum speed,  number of sprints,  distance at differing
intensity levels,  steps and stride.

To be relevant to our target consumer as the performance brandadidas has identified five consumer benefits which form the basis
of the brand's innovation pipeline.  By serving these benefits,  adidas
will remain at the forefront of the industry,  building brand image
and allowing the brand to leverage its technologies and positioning
seamlessly across categories. 
– Faster: To help athletes be faster,  adidas focuses on reducing
product weight,  making the lightest products on the market.  The
franchise will be built with the adizero platform.  Already prominent
in the past two years,  this will continue to be a key initiative for 2012
across all major categories. 
– Stronger: With adiPower,  adidas intends to create a franchise to own
power enhancement in sport.  This platform includes products such
as the Barricade in tennis and TechFit apparel. 
– Smarter: Through interactive products,  adidas is helping athletes
and consumers of all fitness levels to be,  train and perform smarter. 
The brand works with the best athletes and coaches around the
world.  Through platforms such as miCoach,  adidas is taking this
knowledge and making it available to every consumer,  helping them
to define and work towards their individual goals. 
– Cooler: Utilising advanced materials and technologies,  these
products are geared to help the athlete to always have the right
temperature (cooler,  warmer,  wind protection,  etc. ).  This will be
served through the Clima franchise,  which is already one of adidas'
best-known franchises around the world. 
– Natural: Natural motion is a major trend in our industry.  Drawing on
our long history,  experience and understanding of the shape of the
foot and movement of the body,  adidas is creating a new platform
of products around natural motion and will tailor these products to
individual sports.

Five performance benefits 
The UEFA EURO 2012 will be the focal point for showcasing the

 key strategic priority for future growth in the training category is
adidas' dedication to complement its best-in-class product offering
with revolutionary new consumer experiences that bring to life the
adidas vision to be the leading personalised brand in the world. 
Insights from adidas Training's intense activity with athletes and the
world's leading authorities on athlete performance have led to some
significant updates to our miCoach and adidas Core Performance
digital initiatives.  Our aim is to continue to refresh our digital content
to interact with consumers,  providing exercise guidelines and best-inclass services. 

Linked to this,  adidas launched several new technologies and product
updates in 2011.  In footwear,  the brand successfully pre-launched
its new natural adipure Trainer in the USA and Japan   Picture 08.  In
apparel,  Clima365 was relaunched,  forming the key part of the 'cooler"

training range was introduced.  All of these products are designed to
help athletes make the most of their workouts,  whatever their level is. 
In 2012,  adidas Training will launch several new training concepts
and products,  such as Studio Power,  a new apparel range for top
female athletes,  featuring new bra and pant collections.  The adipure
Trainer 360 training shoe for men and women will also be introducedwhich offers unrestricted foot movement and flexibility,  to aggressively go after the natural segment.  Further focus will also be put

adidas has a long history in outdoor,  going back as far as 1978,  when
adidas and climbing legend Reinhold Messner developed a new
generation of boots which he used to reach base camp on his way
to becoming the first man to climb Mount Everest without artificial
oxygen.  With this heritage and the projected growth in the outdoor
sports sector,  adidas has invested in building an authentic and
performance-­ rientated outdoor market position.  Today,  adidas offers

a holistic product range for mountaineers,  climbers,  hikers and other
outdoor athletes.  The collection features technical footwear,  apparelbackpacks and eyewear including the latest adidas developments and
renowned technologies of partners such as Gore-Tex,  WindstopperPrimaloft and Continental. 
 strong cooperation with active mountaineers,  climbers and other
outdoor enthusiasts is an important factor in creating relevant
products for the outdoor athlete's needs.  Therefore,  adidas puts
significant effort into building close industry relationships,  which
include the mountain guides from the traditional Alpine Centre in
Zermatt as well as athletes like Alexander and Thomas Huber (known
as the Huber Brothers),  Reinhold Messner and Sasha DiGiulian,  who is
currently one of the strongest female climbers in the world.

At adidas,  training is the biggest category for both men and women. 
Training supports the preparation and recovery needs of serious
athletes across all sports disciplines and is the industry's largest
apparel category.  Its positioning is driven by the philosophy 'you trainyou win",  and by adidas' desire to support athletes,  no matter what

adidas Originals celebrating originality 

 didas Sport Performance
Terrex Active Shell Jacket 
The market for streetwear and lifestyle sports fashion represents
 unique opportunity for sporting goods companies as it is more
fragmented and larger in size than the market for products used in
sports activity.  In addition,  profitability in the sports lifestyle market is
typically higher as a result of lower product complexity.  adidas was the
first brand to credibly leverage its sports assets in the lifestyle arena
and,  as a result,  is regarded as a legitimate sports lifestyle brand. 
adidas Originals with its iconic Trefoil logo has become a relevant
part of many people's lives,  whether they are skaters,  rockers,  artistsmusicians,  sneakerheads,  sports fans,  etc.    Pictures 11 and 12.

new lightweight hiking boot,  adidas has been rewarded with the
Editor's Choice Award 2012 from the most important German outdoor
magazine,  and has won the notable OutDoor Industry Award for the
third time in a row for three different footwear models.  Moreoveradidas is launching an athletic kids' collection and the Everyday

In 2012,  adidas will also continue to promote the whole outdoor
brand image through a fully integrated marketing campaign including
products,  technologies and exceptional imagery of athletes in action. 
In addition,  cooperation activities with key partners in the sporting
goods and specialty outdoor channels play an important role in
creating visibility,  gaining credibility and driving market share growth. 

To address the needs of its diverse consumer groups and maximise
business opportunities,  adidas Originals takes a three-tier strategy to
brand and product marketing:
–  irst,  the brand invests and innovates in new concepts,  whether it is

street fashion collections,  such as those designed by Jeremy Scott
or by the fashion brand and retailer Opening Ceremony,  or opening
up entirely new categories such as Skate and Surf through Originals'
new Action Sports division. 
–  econd,  this permanent creation of newness and buzz around adidas

Originals then allows us to broaden our messages and expand into
wider business segments such as denim,  Blue or our Women's
collection. 
–  hird,  we commercialise the sub-brand to the widest audience with

concepts such as adicolor,  where consumers can find their mostloved and trend-driving footwear and apparel and accessories
silhouettes in a wide range of colours and executions.

In 2011,  Reebok continued to gain momentum with its strategy of
leading in fitness through its premium sport and lifestyle offering. 
Reebok's target consumer is one who sees staying in shape as a way
to lead a healthy lifestyle and have fun.  In the sports business,  they are
the 25+ year-olds who value style with performance.  In Classics,  they
are 21+ and see athletic-inspired footwear and apparel as a staple in
their wardrobe. 
Incorporating footwear,  apparel and accessories,  adidas NEO label
focuses more on accessible price points,  however maintaining a
premium to competitors.  From a gender split,  adidas NEO is targeting
primarily the girls,  who should account for two-thirds of the business
over time.  In further expanding the label,  a vertical business model
is considered the most effective way to approach the target grouptaking into account the competitive environment and future demands
of successful fashion brands and retailers.  Therefore,  an entirely new
business model has been built to accommodate shorter lead times
and quicker processes in brand and product marketing,  design as well
as in retail operations.  In 2012,  we will start to pilot our own retail
solution in Germany,  where we plan to open 10 stores.  In these test
stores,  new technology,  processes and merchandising techniques
including RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) will be leveraged to
support and optimise daily product delivery.

Unlike many other brands,  Reebok is committed to making fitness
aspirational and fun for everyone by providing consumers with
experiences,  products and the inspiration to be fit for life. 
To bring its fitness philosophy to life,  Reebok has partnered with
CrossFit to introduce consumers to a new way of approaching fitness. 
This signature partnership will create an experience that leverages
and extends beyond the brand's current product and programme
offerings.  As part of this collaboration,  Reebok sponsors the CrossFit
Games,  a competition designed to find the World's Fittest Man and
Woman. 

Reebok strategy and focus areas
In conjunction with this partnership,  Reebok launched the Reebok
CrossFit product line,  a range designed with the input of top CrossFit
athletes   Picture 18.  Created to be the best functional training gear
on the market,  this line currently has limited distribution with select
retailers and online.  In 2012 and beyond,  Reebok will expand the
offerings by taking the pinnacle influences into broader product lines.

To communicate its positioning in fitness,  Reebok is launching the

multi-touchpoint campaign will leverage traditional media such as TVprint and in-store,  but will carry an even higher emphasis on digital and
social elements,  including a relaunched Reebok, com site,  as well as
several grassroots and local events.  Throughout the year,  consumers
will learn about Reebok's passion for fitness,  its partnership with
CrossFit and how its products meet the needs of fitness consumers
worldwide.  By uncovering the passion and camaraderie that can be
found in fitness,  Reebok will reintroduce everyday consumers to what
they love about sport through fitness. 

With a holistic approach to fitness,  Reebok provides consumers with
proprietary technologies based on the three key elements of total
fitness: strength,  conditioning and flexibility.  Through a focused
approach to these elements,  Reebok has developed three key product
concepts:

– EasyTone: Launched in 2009,  EasyTone is based on Reebok's proprietary Moving Air Technology.  It incorporates two balance pods under
the heel and forefoot of the shoes to create natural instability with
every step.  Reebok remains committed to the EasyTone franchise and
recently shared results of a study that reaffirms EasyTone's effect­
iveness in helping consumers transform their body mass composition.  In 2012,  Reebok will continue to bring valued product innovations based on the EasyTone franchise to its consumers,  evolving it
into more lifestyle and sleeker products. 
– ZigTech: ZigTech has been the source of remarkable buzz around
the world since its introduction in 2010.  Its unique sole creates a
distinct running and training shoe with superior cushioning,  which is
designed to conserve and return energy   Picture 20.  In 2012,  ZigTech

innovations in footwear and apparel through these concepts as well
as new offerings that will serve fitness consumers better each day. 

In 2012,  Reebok will celebrate milestones for some of its most iconic
fitness models: the 25th anniversary of the Workout Plus and the
30th anniversary of the Freestyle.  Additionally,  the brand will feature
both Always Classic and New Classics products in a new campaign
called 'It Takes A Lot To Make A Classic".  This campaign focuses on
the parallels between the effort Reebok puts into making every shoe
that carries the Classics brand name a classic,  and the journey of
individuals who have worked hard and persevered in order to pursue
their dream of becoming classic.  As Reebok Classics resides at the
intersection of music and street/pop culture,  the campaign features
relevant musicians and performers from around the world.

Sergio García and Martin Kaymer fired Penta TP golf balls with R11
drivers at a target   Picture 02.  Furthermore,  throughout the final round
of the U.S.  Open 2011,  TaylorMade held a sweepstake to give away

­ aylorMade: determined to be the leading golf brand in
every key equipment category

­ aylorMade's priority is to become the leader in each individual golf
equipment category.  That means strengthening its position as the
number one metalwood brand,  expanding its leading position in irons
and ascending to the top market position in wedges,  putters,  balls and
accessories. 
20

84

– Metalwoods: ­ aylorMade is the clear market leader in metalwoods

(drivers,  fairway woods and hybrids),  bolstered by a particularly
strong presence in the USA,  where it forged an all-time high of a 45%
share in March 2011.  The brand's primary focus going forward is to
remain the innovation leader and expand its metalwood business
outside the USA. 

03

– Wedges: Leveraging ­aylorMade's success in metalwoods and

irons to other categories such as wedges continues to be a strategic
priority.  Innovation is critical in this respect and,  in 2011,  TaylorMade
­
continued to validate its innovation leadership with the introduction of
the All Terrain Versatility (ATV) wedge.  Its unique sole design allows
the golfer to play a wide variety of different types of shots with one
wedge.  The ATV wedge also incorporates a new,  high-spinning groove
design,  and the flat areas of the face are covered with a micro-texture
that helps hold the ball to impart backspin.

– Putters: ­ aylorMade has achieved excellent growth in putters during

the past few years amid the performance benefits of white putterheads integrated in products like the Tour-proven Corza Ghost and
Ghost Spider.  To build on this momentum in 2012,  the brand will
launch further additions to the Ghost line of putters,  which will all be
white-coloured and incorporate PureRoll face insert technology to
promote smooth,  accurate roll. 
From a product perspective,  the brand will launch the new R11S
driver and fairway woods,  as well as the new RocketBallz line in
2012   Picture 03.  Compared to the R11,  the R11S driver has a larger
and more aerodynamic head,  offering more adjustability settings.  The
RocketBallz driver combines light weight with TaylorMade's Flight
­
Control Technology,  helping to increase ball speed and distance.  All
of ­ aylorMade's new metalwoods feature the white crown and black

clubface. 
– Irons: In 2011,  the Tour Preferred MB,  MC and CB irons helped
solidify ­ aylorMade as the leading iron brand in the USA.  Two major

introductions in 2012 will play a key role to further growth in the
category: RocketBallz irons and RocketBallz Max irons.  Both utilise

­aylorMade's expertise in developing thin and fast clubfaces that
promote long distance.  RocketBallz irons are engineered to deliver
the optimum combination of speed,  forgiveness,  playability and feel. 
RocketBallz Max irons incorporate multiple performance technologies,  including hollow head construction learned from years of
making metalwoods. 

– Golf balls: Success in this category depends on the ability to create
high-performance golf balls,  bring them to market and build credibility
among Tour professionals.  In 2011,  TaylorMade's status as a maker of
­
premium golf balls solidified as more Tour pros and consumers used
the five-layer Penta TP.  ­TaylorMade's plans to increase golf ball market
share in 2012 include the introduction of the Penta TP5   Picture 04 which is faster and softer than the original Penta TP,  as well as the
lower-priced Penta TP3,  a three-layer ball with a cast urethane cover. 
Together,  these two models should help TaylorMade capture a larger
­
share of the Tour ball market.  Additionally,  a two-piece distance model
called RocketBallz is being introduced.

– Accessories: Golfers need more than equipment to play the game
at their highest level,  they also need accessories like gloves,  bagshead covers,  towels and umbrellas.  ­aylorMade is committed to

improving its position in the accessories market,  starting by taking the
accessories business in-house (the brand had licensed its name to an
outside company for the past six years),  which will allow closer control
over design and help the brand gain a larger share of a category which
offers significant growth opportunities.

Given the strong global presence the adidas Group enjoys,  Rockport
sees significant potential for leveraging the Group's infrastructure

to international markets.  Rockport's international expansion will
continue in 2012 and beyond,  and sales outside of the United States
will further increase.  Regional offices have already been established
in Europe and Asia to further support growth in these regions. 

Roll out a profitable mono-brand retail concept
Full-price own-retail stores are planned to be the main growth driver
within the brand over the next years.  The target is that a fifth of total
sales should originate from full-price own retail by 2014. 
In 2011,  Rockport opened more than 80 points of sale in Russia,  ChinaSouth Korea and other markets around the world,  with the majority
being opened as mono-brand concept stores   picture 10.  Based on
encouraging results to date in our existing store base,  Rockport
will continue to further roll out its mono-brand retail concept in key
markets during 2012. 

In 2011,  Rockport participated in Vogue's 'Fashion's Night Out"a worldwide after-hours shopping extravaganza where celebrities,  designers and stars mingle with shoppers at exclusive events

Focus on high-end performance
Reebok-CCM Hockey has a dual brand portfolio consisting of Reebok
Hockey and CCM.  Reebok Hockey is a global hockey brand.  Its
products are designed with emphasis on innovative visible technologies that speak to an expressive,  image-conscious consumer. 
CCM is hockey's most authentic brand,  having been in existence since
1899.  CCM embraces the physical side of the game and speaks to a
consumer seeking performance and quality. 
Reebok-CCM Hockey's primary goal is to lead in the high-end
perform­ nce segment of the hockey market.  Therefore,  Reebok-CCM

Hockey has a clear focus on product innovation,  supported by
professional player validation achieved by having the best athletes
in the world play with Reebok-CCM Hockey products.  Furthermoredifferentiated marketing and brand campaigns are targeted towards
the intended consumer segments,  for example players or fans. 

The key priority for Reebok-CCM Hockey's innovation team is to design
and market products that are targeted to be different and better than
those of the competition,  with a dedication to providing elite athletes
with high-performance products.  With its emphasis on continued
product innovation,  products incorporate proprietary and patented
technological advances   see Research and Development,  p.  95.  Reebok
Hockey's The Pump skates,  KFS protective equipment,  Sickick and A, i
sticks,  the 5-Point Safety System 11K helmet and the Edge uniform
exemplify the brand's breakthrough technologies.  CCM's product
innovation story is led by its family of U+ high-performance equipmentincluding the customisable CCM U+ Crazy Light skate,  the CCM U+
stick and U+ Crazy Light protective,  the lightest high-performance
protective in the world   Picture 13. 

Professional player validation
Reebok-CCM Hockey recognises that success with the consumer is
heavily influenced by exposure generated at the Pro League level. 
Product usage by the best players in the game validates Reebok-CCM
Hockey's product performance credentials,  and both brands are highly
visible among professional ice hockey leagues worldwide. 
–  eebok-CCM Hockey has the strongest league partnerships within

the industry.  It is the exclusive licensee of jerseys for the National
Hockey League (NHL),  the American Hockey League (AHL),  the
Canadian Hockey League (CHL) and many of the European National (8)
and Elite League (60) teams.  Reebok-CCM Hockey is also the official

Key strategic categories to drive growth
Reebok-CCM Hockey intends to accomplish growth through a
continuous stream of product launches in its key category priorities:
skates,  sticks,  protective & helmets and licensed apparel. 

14


 eebok Hockey
A, i 9 Sticks 
– Protective: In summer 2011,  the 11K helmet was launchedfeaturing the 5-Point Safety System.  This product is the first in a series
of products to enhance players' safety and was developed in collabor­
ation with universities and medical experts.  In September 2011,  CCM
presented to retailers the lightest protective equipment,  the U+ Crazy
Light,  which will be delivered in spring 2012. 
– Licensed apparel: Reebok-CCM Hockey will strive to further
leverage its league partnerships and exclusive uniform status to drive
growth.  In addition to official uniforms,  Reebok-CCM Hockey will take
advantage of its status as the official NHL locker room performance
apparel supplier,  and its exclusive rights related to the NHL Players'
Association (NHLPA) for name and numbered apparel and headwear. 
Reebok-CCM Hockey is also developing its capacity to perform in a
reactive market and maximise sales potential linked to special events
such as the Stanley Cup Final,  All-Star Game and Winter Classic. 

Increase profitability through supply chain efficiencies
Another strategic priority for Reebok-CCM Hockey is to continue to
pursue a movement away from own manufacturing to sourcing goods. 
In 2011,  for example,  the transfer of helmet production from North
America to China was finalised,  and the transfer of high-end skates
production from Canada to Thailand in 2012 was also announced. 
Manufacturing activities will be maintained mainly to develop and
manufacture performance products for pro level athletes. 

Pricing strategy mirrors product positioning
– Skates: The focus in the skate category is to drive market share
increases through products addressing critical aspects such as fitweight and durability.  An example of this is the U+ platform which
features the CCM U+ Crazy Light skate,  the brand's most thermoformable and customisable skate to date.  In addition,  in September
2011,  a new line of Reebok Hockey skates,  led by the 20K Pump,  was
successfully presented to retailers.  It features an advanced fit element
and is designed with a focus on lightweight and durable materials.  The
full line will be delivered to markets in spring 2012. 

Reebok-CCM Hockey's pricing strategy is consistent with its highperformance positioning in the sport.  Through a commitment to
product innovation,  Reebok-CCM Hockey's pricing strategy is to
dominate the market in the premium price segments and to be a
strong competitor within the mid-price segment of the market.

– Sticks: To drive future growth in the sticks category,  ReebokCCM Hockey focuses on developing new technologies that incorporate enhanced power,  feel,  flexibility and weight.  Launched in the
fourth quarter of 2011,  Reebok Hockey's A, i sticks feature the new
2:1 Power Taper ratio for maximum power transfer and Xlerated
Blade technology for better reaction time with the puck   Picture 14.  In
2011,  CCM launched its new CCM U+ Crazy Light stick,  the lightest
perform­ nce stick in the marketplace,  along with the launch of the

U+ Crazy Strong stick,  a high-performance stick engineered to offer
greater durability.

–  eebok-CCM Hockey has formed endorsement partnerships with

many of the best athletes in the world.  With development capabilities close to the world's major leagues,  the two brands can respond
rapidly with customised solutions.  This provides a strong competitive
advantage in attracting key pro athletes.  Reebok Hockey is currently
endorsed by NHL players such as Sidney Crosby,  Pavel DatsyukPatrice Bergeron,  Dion Phaneuf,  Matt Duchene,  Roberto Luongo and
Marc-Andre Fleury.  CCM's roster of player endorsees includes Joe
Thornton,  Vincent Lecavalier,  John Tavares,  Marián Hossa and the
revelations of the 2011-2012 season Ryan Nugent-Hopkins,  Gabriel
Landeskog and Sean Couturier.

Global Operations manages the development,  production planning,  sourcing and distribution of the

supply chain and ensure the highest standards in product quality and delivery performance for our
customers and our own-retail and eCommerce activities at competitive costs.

The vision of Global Operations is to be closest to every consumer.  The
function strives to provide the right product to consumers in the right
size,  colour and style,  in the right place,  at the right time,  across the
entire range of the Group's channels and brands. 

it will also ensure our supply chain remains a competitive advantage
in making us the partner of choice for our consumers and customers
alike. 

Ensuring cost competitiveness
Global Operations has a strong track record for establishing state-ofthe-art infrastructure,  processes and systems.  The function has been
successfully consolidating and improving legacy structures,  reducing
complexity and cost for the Group.  By taking strong ownership for
quality,  cost and availability,  we have proven that we are able to
respond to the fast-changing requirements of both our consumers
and customers. 

Global Operations focuses on further optimising product creation
through an efficient material and colour selection process.  Thiscoupled with increased automation in manufacturing,  will enhance
productivity,  shorten lead times and improve overall quality.  These
improvements are expected to enhance profitability for the Group
and ensure we provide our consumers with the best value proposition
possible. 

To support our Route 2015 strategic business plan,  Global Operations
focuses on five strategic priorities driven by several key initiatives 
 table 01.  The implementation of these initiatives is well underwaywith three already completed in 2011 (adidas NEO label,  Fast and Lean
Creation and FlexPLM).  By continuing to deliver on these initiativesGlobal Operations will not only enable the Group to achieve its goals
In 2011,  a joint effort between Global Operations and Global Brands
yielded initial results on consolidating material and colour numberswhich will already start to deliver benefits in spring/summer 2013. 
In the area of automation and manufacturing efficiency,  pilot lines
were established in several factories for most categories.  Parts
produced per hour for these lines have improved in some instances

by almost 40%.  The function will continue to look for opportunities
to semi-automate process steps in production where possible,  while
supporting this effort with the endorsement of lean manufacturing
principles throughout its supply base. 
The Profitability Management department within Global Operations
assumes a central role in realising cost competitiveness by driving
our strategic costing efforts and optimising our buying strategies. 
Throughout 2011,  the function has been developing a model of profit
and productivity incentives that serves as a basis for productivity
improvement discussions with our supply base.  As part of this
initiative,  data and documenting processes were analysed across
the adidas and Reebok brands to make differences in cost policies
transparent in order to align them longer-term. 

Providing industry-leading availability
Building on the solid platform that has been established to ensure
product availability,  Global Operations is further shortening our orderto-delivery lead times.  This will be accomplished by establishing and
offering a set of tailored and sophisticated replenishment models to our
customers and own-retail activities via improvements in our planning
systems and processes.  The overarching goal of these initiatives is to
delay decisions on customer-specific order adjustments to the latest
possible point in time for increased flexibility in how we plan,  producedeliver and stock product. 
As part of this priority,  Global Operations is building five new supporting
system solutions that use SAP as a basis to standardise,  automatebundle and execute market processes and system functionalities.  The
roll-out of these systems and processes is a prerequisite to enable
enhanced value-added services (e.g.  labelling,  price tags and RFID
tags) at our factories and distribution centres.  These are also critical
for our flexible make-to-stock service which aims to improve product
availability and inventory utilisation by planning and building inventory
buffers at different locations further up the supply chain. 

Other capabilities that the function is building include an increased
level of transparency on lead times in our supply chain.  This will
allow for more pro-active and accurate instructions on delivery timesplanning and purchasing,  resulting in a reduction of workload and
increased customer satisfaction.  Another important aspect will be the
introduction of the capability to transfer inventory between locations in
 more automated manner. 

Enabling later ordering
Enabling later ordering is a cross-functional priority in Global
Operations aimed at allowing our customers and own-retail network
to order our products closer to the time of sale,  facilitating buying
decisions that are based on better market knowledge. 
This priority focuses on reducing production lead times on footwear
and,  ultimately,  apparel to 60 days.  In 2011,  we succeeded in bringing
70% of Reebok footwear articles onto this lead time.  Since the majority
of adidas footwear is already on 60 days,  the change will allow us to
align sales processes across the brands and improve efficiencies.  For
apparel,  Global Operations has now developed a 60-day lead time
concept,  which will be rolled out in three phases starting in the second
half of 2013. 
Further order-to-delivery lead time reductions will be achieved
through a greater regional source base,  which will enable us to
manufacture closer to our key markets to deliver and replenish
products faster.  Today,  Global Operations already sources significant
portions of apparel for the US market regionally.  Business cases for
additional countries and specific business categories are currently
being reviewed. 
On Group level,  Global Operations is also a key contributor to the
company's Integrated Business Planning (IBP) project   see Internal
Group Management System,  p.  114.  IBP forms part of the Group's Driving Route
2015 programme and aims at establishing a coherent end-to-end
demand and supply planning process across finance,  marketing and
operations.

in the Route 2015 strategic business plan,  such as the adidas NEO
label,  market and channel programmes as well as brand programmes
such as customisation   see Global Brands Strategy,  p.  68    see Global Sales

With the establishment of three- and ten-month concept-to-shelf
processes and a dedicated source base,  the framework to service the
fast-fashion adidas NEO label model was successfully completed and
handed over for implementation in 2011.  The focus in 2012 will now be
on providing supply chain services for all adidas NEO stores. 
In 2011,  Global Operations also provided support in further harmon­
ising customisation processes and systems.  It has clearly defined
supply chain capabilities that support the demand growth for the
customisation business until 2015 and supported the evaluation of
existing customisation processes for adidas and Reebok footwear. 
For Retail,  Global Operations continues to offer its short lead time
capabilities with the ultimate goal of enabling a demand-driven supply
chain that leverages existing short lead time production models to
improve availability without excessive inventory. 

Other important milestones in 2011 were the completion and handover
of the new,  streamlined Fast and Lean Creation (FLC) process and the
new product life cycle management system for apparel (FlexPLM). 
The FLC programme was introduced in February 2009 with the goal
of simplifying the Group's product creation process across operationssourcing and the supply base,  as well as harmonising processes
between the adidas and Reebok brands.  Global Operations has also
been supporting the company's continued efforts in introducing
virtualisation to 3D design,  product prototyping and sampling.  It has
helped to enable the first completely virtual sell-in process tested in
France in 2011,  which saw a fully virtual product presentation with
just one physical colourway for all articles.  As increasing numbers
of internal and external customers embrace the technology,  this will
drive a longer-term reduction in product samples and therefore cost 
 see Global sales strategy,  p.  62.  Finally,  Global Operations is also about
to complete the implementation of the Group's Global Procurement
Solution,  GPS.  The final system release will see an improved
integration of and connectivity to suppliers and third-party logistics
providers.  Pilot systems have already gone live for factories in ChinaVietnam and Cambodia with the global go-live scheduled for 2012. 
With the final phase of the project,  Rockport and the company's Sports
Licensed Division in the USA will start using GPS in late 2012. 

Supporting Driving Route 2015 initiatives
Modernising the Group's infrastructure
Global Operations continues to focus on building the required infrastructure,  processes and systems to support the Group's growth
plans.  This includes further process simplification,  consolidation of
legacy systems and distribution structures,  as well as the creation of
state-of-the-art systems required to support new business demands. 
As a significant milestone under this priority,  Global Operations
announced the building of a state-of-the-art Central Distribution
Centre (CDC) near Osnabrueck,  Germany,  to service European
markets.  The CDC will open in 2013.  By 2015,  the CDC will be capable
of holding 35 million pieces during peak times and will handle a
throughput of more than 100 million pieces annually for the adidasReebok and Rockport brands across all channels.  In 2011,  Global
Operations also successfully moved and integrated logistics flows for
TaylorMade-adidas Golf and Rockport into the Spartanburg Distribution Centre (USA).  In addition,  Global Operations successfully
rolled out the Group's standard warehouse management system
'Manhattan" to warehouses in Panama and China.  Manhattan will
also be introduced in other new distribution facilities the function is
building,  e.g.  in Mexico and South Korea. 

The implementation of the company's Driving Route 2015 programme 
 see Group Strategy,  p.  60 sees the addition of three new initiatives to the
Global Operations strategy until 2015. 
– Superior service for the adidas brand's 'Global Foundation Range":
Global Operations will give products ranged as part of the 'Global
Foundation Range" preferred treatment in terms of availability and
replenishment   see Global Brands Strategy,  p.  68. 
– Establishing an above-market European supply chain: Global
Operations will work on centralising supply chain capabilities such
as purchasing and inventory management to provide a central service
to all European markets.  The pooling of supply chain services on
above-market level aims at reducing supply chain cost and increasing
product availability. 
– Organisational integration: Global Operations will assume end-toend responsibility for the Group's supply chain with all market
operations and local sourcing functions moving into Global Operations
by 2013.  Local systems and processes are being reviewed and
harmonised for ultimate integration into global structures.

Majority of production through independent suppliers
To minimise production costs,  we outsource almost 100% of production
to independent third-party suppliers,  primarily located in Asia.  While
we provide them with detailed specifications for production and
delivery,  these suppliers possess excellent expertise in cost-efficient
high-volume production of footwear,  apparel and hardware.  The latest
list of our suppliers can be found on our website  :  www, adidas-Group. 
com/en/sustainability/suppliersandworkers. 
The adidas Group also operates a limited amount of own production
and assembly sites in Germany (1),  Sweden (1),  Finland (1),  the USA (4)Canada (3) and China (1).  In order to ensure the high quality consumers
expect from our products,  we enforce strict control and inspection
procedures at our suppliers and in our own factories.  In addition,  we
promote adherence to social and environmental standards throughout
our supply chain   see Sustainability,  p.  107. 
Our Global Operations function manages product developmentcommercialisation and distribution,  and also supervises sourcing for
adidas and Reebok as well as for adidas Golf   Diagram 02.  Due to the
specific sourcing requirements in their respective fields of businessTaylorMade,  Rockport,  Reebok-CCM Hockey and the Sports Licensed
Division are not serviced through Global Operations,  but instead utilise
their own purchasing organisation.  In order to quickly seize short-term
opportunities in their local market or react to trade regulations,  Group
subsidiaries may also source from selected local suppliers outside the
realm of Global Operations.  Local purchases,  however,  account only
for a minor portion of the Group's total sourcing volume.

China share of footwear production decreases
97% of our total 2011 footwear volume for adidas,  Reebok and adidas
Golf was produced in Asia (2010: 97%).  Production in Europe and the
Americas combined accounted for 3% of the sourcing volume (2010:
3%)   Diagram 04.  China represents our largest sourcing country with
approximately 35% of the total volume,  followed by Vietnam with
29% and Indonesia with 26%.  As part of our strategy to increase the
regional diversity of our supplier base,  the overall representation of
China in our sourcing mix declined 4 percentage points.  At the same
time,  the footwear volumes sourced from Cambodia more than tripled
in 2011 from a low comparison base.  In 2011,  our footwear suppliers
produced approximately 245 million pairs of shoes (2010: 219 million
pairs)   Diagram 05.  The year-over-year increase was driven by the
strong sales growth in 2011.  Our largest footwear factory produced
approximately 9% of the footwear sourcing volume (2010: 9%).

Overall number of manufacturing partners increases
In 2011,  Global Operations worked with 308 independent manufacturing partners (2010: 270),  representing an increase of 38 versus the
prior year.  The number of suppliers increased throughout all product
categories (footwear,  apparel and hardware) and was mainly the
result of the significant growth in volumes and expansion into new
sourcing countries (e.g.  Cambodia).  Of our independent manufacturing partners,  77% were located in Asia,  15% in the Americas,  7% in
Europe and 1% in Africa   Diagram 03.  30% of all suppliers were located

Research and Development 
R&D an integral part of the product creation process 
Selective purchase of external R&D expertise 
R&D within the adidas Group follows a decentralised approach. 
However,  fundamental research as well as expertise and competencies
in sustainable product creation are shared across the Group.  In line
with their strategic and long-term visions and distinctive positioningeach brand runs its own research,  design and develop­ ent activities. 

These teams generally have either a category or a technology focus. 

In addition to its internal R&D efforts,  the adidas Group also purchases
 limited amount of R&D expertise from well-established research
partners.  This strategy allows for greater flexibility and faster access
to know-how that may otherwise require considerable time and
resources if built up within the Group.  To increase efficiency and
protect research results,  collaborations are usually long-term and
exclusive.  All projects carried out with external partners are based
on a clearly defined mandate outlining the project scope to ensure
consistency with the Group's R&D focus.  Major adidas relationships
exist with the University of Loughborough,  England,  the University
of Calgary,  Canada,  the University of Michigan,  USA,  the University
of Erlangen-Nuremberg and the University of Freiburg,  Germanyas well as Waseda University,  Tokyo,  Japan.  In 2011,  we intensified
our research initiatives in the field of 'digital sports" and funded an
endowed professorship at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg. 
adidas also partnered with German tyre company Continental,  to
develop industry-leading traction rubber materials that offer security
and stability while minimising weight.  These compounds were
integrated into the sole of the Terrex Fast R GTX hiking boot and in the
adizero adios 2,  which was worn by Patrick Makau when he set a new
world record at the Berlin Marathon in September 2011.  In 2011,  joint
loading and injury prevention studies were carried out on the adidas
f50 adizero football boot in association with the University of Freiburg. 
Also in 2011,  specific basketball and running performance studies
were carried out at the University of Calgary.  These formed an integral
part of the development of the adizero Crazy Light basketball shoe
and adizero adios running shoe.  In 2011,  Reebok also continued its
research with R&D institutes around the world,  which included testing
on EasyTone footwear with Arizona State University,  EasyTone apparel
with Colorado State University and lacrosse biomechanics with the
University of Las Vegas.  In 2011,  TaylorMade-adidas Golf continued its
long-term cooperation with researchers at the University of Calgarywith extensive joint swing dynamic studies,  identifying the influence of
shaft variations on player performance and perception. 

R&D is closely integrated with the sourcing,  design and product
marketing functions.  At the beginning of the product creation processmarketing defines a development priority,  which may also include
certain sustainability targets.  This is derived on a case-by-case basis
from a combination of consumer research and feedback,  competition
analysis and own product testing. 
Independently from specific development requests,  our innovation
teams also analyse new materials,  production processes or scientific
research often even from other industries to increase the exchange
and scope of idea generation.  The sourcing team,  together with the
innovation and material teams within product development,  work
closely with our suppliers to identify innovative materials as well as
integrate sustainability,  cost and production process aspects into the
development phase. 
Once conceptualised,  new technologies are engineered using state-ofthe-art systems.  Extensive virtual prototype testing and engineering
loops are carried out on each technology,  which promotes faster
development phases as well as improved concept and quality,  while
simultaneously reducing physical material and resource requirements.  Once a new technology is deemed viable,  it is produced as a
physical sample.  These are then comprehensively tested by a broad
range of users including top athletes.  Only when these comprehensive
tests have been successful,  are these technologies handed over to
product marketing,  which commercialises the technology to a final
product.

Creating innovative products to meet the needs of both professional and everyday athletes and consumers
is a prerequisite to strengthening our market position in the sporting goods industry.  In a rapidly changing
world,  research and development (R&D) is essential to help us find new product concepts,  processes
and production methods that are both beneficial to the business as well as facilitate our ambitions in
the area of sustainability.  Each year,  we therefore invest considerable resources into developing and
commercialising new technologies as well as fresh design ideas,  in order to offer the best experience
for our users.  Our R&D teams have diverse professional competencies and backgrounds.  Their activities
are highly integrated and cross-functional,  supported by a significant degree of functional co-location to
create synergies and efficiencies in innovation.  In 2012,  R&D will focus on customisation,  digital sports
technologies and sustainable product innovation.

R&D expenses increased 13% to € 115 million (2010: € 102 million) as
 result of increases at the adidas brand from initiatives relating to the
development of intelligent products   Diagram 02.  Personnel expenses
represent the largest portion of R&D expenses,  accounting for more
than 68% of total R&D expenses.  In 2011,  R&D expenses represented 21% of other operating expenses versus 20% in the prior year

We aim at improving our ability to adapt to changing consumer
preferences more quickly,  flexibly and efficiently.  We achieve this
by facilitating the direct interaction with and involvement of our
suppliers in product creation,  quality control,  product testing and
commercialisation.  In 2011,  we completed our Fast and Lean Creation
programme which saw the implementation of direct development
processes for footwear and apparel.  In addition,  we also made further
progress on strengthening the cross-functional collaboration between
marketing,  design and our development teams early in the creation
process.  The resulting improved and closer interaction reduces the
amount of costly and time-consuming product changes in the latter
stages of the development process.

As in prior years,  the majority of adidas Group sales was generated

tend to have a higher gross margin compared to products which have
been in the market for more than one season.  As a result,  newly

In 2011,  adidas sales were again driven by the latest product offeringswith products launched during the course of the year accounting for
74% of brand sales (2010: 75%).  Only 3% of sales were generated
with products introduced three or more years ago (2010: 2%).  The
major R&D innovations for the adidas brand were created and
aligned to support and strengthen its five key Sport Performance
attributes – i) faster ii) smarter iii) stronger iv) cooler and v) natural. 
The faster attribute became a reality through the evolution of the ultralightweight adizero family of products.  In running,  the adizero Primethe lightest commercial sprint spike ever created,  was worn by Yohan
Blake and helped him become the World 100m Champion at the 2011
IAAF World Championships.  In the basketball category,  the adizero
Crazy Light,  the lightest shoe in basketball,  and the adizero Roseenjoyed considerable commercial success.  This ultra-­
lightweight
shoe was built to help players to be faster,  jump higher and perform
better on the court.  In 2011,  the lightest and fastest football boot also
became the smartest in the game,  with the introduction of the adizero
miCoach football boot.  Utilising the miCoach SpeedCell technology
in the sole of the boot,  it is the ultimate digital training tool,  allowing
users to track and upload key performance data and to compare and
share stats via the miCoach football app.  For stronger,  the adiPower
Howard basketball shoe Dwight Howard's signature shoe provides
outstanding power and reinforcement required for hard lateral and
rotation movements.  This is made possible through the Sprintskin
upper technology combined with the Z-torsion system.  In 2011,  adidas
launched the adipure Trainer,  the first barefoot training shoe designed
specifically for the gym.  This shoe promotes pure and natural
movement by harnessing the body's natural mechanics,  activating and
strengthening muscles,  building balance and promoting dexterity.  The

In 2011,  Reebok's latest products continued to generate the majority
of Reebok's sales,  with an estimated 69% of footwear sales coming
from products launched in 2011 (2010: 63%).  Only 10% of footwear
product sales relate to products introduced three or more years ago
(2010: 15%).  Reebok expanded its toning offering with the introduction of EasyTone+,  SlimTone and SimplyTone.  Each toning platform
is designed to be softer and less stable than conventional shoesconceived to mimic the effect of walking on a soft beach.  Reebok
expanded the highly successful ZigTech technology platform,  which
features a unique zig-shaped lightweight foam sole that is designed
to absorb the impact of heel strike and sends a wave of energy along
the length of the shoe.  A lower-profile,  firmer version of ZigTech
called ZigNano was also introduced in 2011.  In addition,  Reebok introduced a new technology pillar called RealFlex,  which provides a point
of difference in the emerging lightweight/barefoot running segment. 
Featuring 76 sensors on the bottom unit,  it is designed to naturally flex
to give a barefoot/natural feel while offering more protection by virtue
of the geometric shape and height of the nodes as well as the proprietary foam used   see Reebok Strategy,  p.  78. 

Innovation a key success factor for
TaylorMade-adidas Golf
At TaylorMade-adidas Golf,  current products (i, e.  products launched
in the last 18 months,  which is the typical product life cycle in golf)
represented 78% of total hardware sales in 2011 (2010: 58%).  Products
that had been brought to market three or more years ago accounted
for 5% of sales in 2011 (2010: 5%).  Among the highlight product
launches in 2011 was the R11 line of drivers.  This driver incorporates
new Adjustable Sole Plate technology into TaylorMade's proven Flight
Control Technology and Movable Weight Technology to create the
ultimate golf driver experience.  The Burner SuperFast 20 driveralso launched in 2011,  is lighter,  faster and longer than the previous
generation thanks to lighter components and better aerodynamics. 
With their stand-out white colour finish,  both lines of driver,  the R11
and the SuperFast,  were retail hits in 2011.  Their striking appearancewhich enhances visual perception by making the clubhead appear
larger,  helps improve alignment,  while also reducing hot spots. 
This unique and new finish combined with breakthrough technology
contributed to TaylorMade capturing over 40% of the U.S.  metalwoods
market share in March a month after their launch,  and they went on
to maintain this early success all year long.  Following the success in 
Rockport extends truWalk architecture and delivers
athletic-inspired pumps
Due to the different business model for the Rockport brand as a leather
shoe company,  the impact from new styles is significantly lower
compared to our other brands.  Products launched in 2011 accounted
for an estimated 58% of sales (2010: 52%).  In 2011,  R&D efforts
concentrated on making shoes more walkable and this was achieved
by extending Rockport's innovative truWalk architecture into dresscasual and rugged casual shoe products.  This included ­ resSports

shoes,  making them some of the most lightweight,  walkable shoes
in the industry.  The truWalk architecture works with the foot's natural
motion,  resulting in a more comfortable,  energised stride.  Using
adiPrene technology by adidas,  truWalk enables a soft heel-striketransitioning to a smooth roll through the arch,  and finishing with a
forefoot flex for an energised push-off.  On the women's side,  R&D
efforts concentrated on creating athletic-inspired comfort in stylish
business-oriented high-heel silhouettes.  The Janae collection was
launched in 2011,  with pumps featuring NanoGlide lining,  adiPrene
technology,  and thick-latex arch support for extra cushioningresulting in a more walkable shoe for women   see Rockport Strategy,  p.  86. 

Reebok-CCM Hockey innovates in sticks and skates
At Reebok-CCM Hockey,  products launched in 2011 accounted for
55% of sales in North America.  Only 15% of sales were generated
with products introduced three or more years ago.  CCM launches
were headlined by the roll-out of the remaining U+ Skate line offeringfollowing the launch of the flagship U+ Crazy Light in the fourth quarter
of 2010.  The new U+ line offers market-leading heat customisation
and fit at all price points.  The U+ Crazy Light II stick continued to push
the performance boundaries with its lightweight aerial grade carbon
construction and new sweet spot technology.  Reebok Hockey launch
highlights were the 11K ReeFit helmet and the A, i 9 composite stick. 
The 11K helmet provides players with a unique 5-point safety system
based on the fact that the helmet that 'fits the best,  protects the best".

Our Group remains committed to maintaining a full and innovative
product pipeline,  bringing new groundbreaking technologies and
evolutions of concepts to the market each year   see Group Strategy,  p.  60. 
In 2012,  customisation,  digital sports technologies and sustainable
product innovation will be at the forefront of adidas R&D activities as
we aim to position the brand as both a sustainable and technology
leader in the sporting goods industry.  Reebok's R&D activities in
2012 will centre on the brand's strategy to continue to target fitness
through three technology pillars: ZigTech,  RealFlex and Toning.  Each
platform will be expanded to provide additional user experience and
retail opportunities.  The key in all the platform evolutions will be that
no technology is considered complete unless it offers consumers a
unique experience that they can feel.

TaylorMade-adidas Golf's develop­ ent efforts will reinforce industry

leadership by enhancing golfers' performance through adjustability
features in metalwoods,  delivering a new level of distance with the
breakthrough technology in the new RocketBallz club line,  precise
customisation in irons,  and increased distance of Tour balls.  Rockport
will focus its product development on light weight,  comfort and
walkability.  In April 2012,  Rockport will introduce the next evolution
of truWalk with truWalk Zero.  truWalk Zero is the lead concept for
Rockport to claim ownership of lightness in the brown shoe industry. 
It is the culmination of years of research and testing,  and is one of
the lightest shoes that Rockport has ever designed.  Reebok-CCM
Hockey R&D efforts will focus on introducing new technologies and
at the same time advancing existing product platforms with a focus on
performance skates and sticks.

Employees
Becoming the global leader in the sporting goods industry depends upon the potential,  dedicationknowledge and performance of our employees and the excellence of our leaders.  Therefore,  we foster
a corporate culture of performance,  passion,  integrity and diversity,  as we are convinced this is crucial
to stimulate innovation,  team spirit and engagement. 

Engagement drives performance 
20

We strive to have the right team in place by focusing our activities on the implementation and execution of our Group's Human Resources strategy,  which is
based upon three pillars:
– 
Creating a working environment that stimulates team spirit,  passionengagement and achievement
see 'Engagement drives performance",  p.  101
see 'Internal communication activities to drive employee engagement",  p.  103

– 
Expanding our performance culture based upon strong leadership 
In 2010,  we conducted the first Group-wide employee engagement
survey.  We achieved an outstanding participation rate of 90% and
an engagement score which places us close to the top-performing
organisations within the consumer goods industry.  This score
was underpinned by our employees' high level of confidence in our
senior leaders,  their perception of clarity concerning the Group's
strategic direction,  as well as an open and constructive work climate. 
Areas for further improvement identified by employees included
career develop­ ent and transparency,  availability of IT tools,  and

perform­ance recognition. 
Our senior leaders are responsible for,  and committed to,  increasing
the engagement scores.  As in previous years,  based upon the feedback
received,  Results-to-Action teams were established to drive initiatives to enhance the Group's performance.  In 2011,  the focus of our
Results-to-Action initiative was to maintain our top-scoring areas and
improve upon areas of weakness.  Since implementing the Resultsto-Action teams,  we have action plans in over 83% of the organisation.  This means in more than four out of five adidas Group teams
our managers are evaluating their engagement scores and working
with their employees to improve the engagement within their teams. 
The adidas Group also took action at a global and strategic levelfocusing on areas such as workspace,  collaboration and knowledge
management,  employee careers,  work-life integration and more. 
Results-to-Action is becoming a way of working for the adidas Group. 
In 2012,  some functions of the adidas Group will conduct a pulse check
survey to review the impacts of our actions.  In 2013,  we will conduct
our next global employee engagement survey across the adidas Group.

  Three-pillar Human Resources strategy 
We believe that employee satisfaction drives commitmentcommitment drives engagement,  and engagement drives business
performance.  Consequently,  we have defined engagement as one of
our Group's key performance indicators for measuring our efforts to
sustain a 'performance culture".  To capture employee perceptionswe carry out formal engagement surveys to evaluate our position as
the employer of choice for our employees and to provide a framework
for benchmarking.

Being an 'employer of choice"
Measures taken in order to implement our strategy are explained in the text
sections referred to above. 

Enabling employees to reach their personal best
To reach their personal best,  our Group employees are offered a wide
variety of training and development opportunities,  building on their
strengths,  improving their skills and overcoming their own challenges. 
Our highest priority is to match individual employee aspirations with
our organisational needs.  The framework for all development activities is set by the adidas Group Competency Model.  Detailed out for all
hierarchy levels,  it ensures consistent and transparent performancetalent and career/succession management   Diagram 01. 
Performance management: Our global Performance Evaluation and
Planning tool (PEP) is the cornerstone of performance management
at the adidas Group.  Based on business targets as well as job tasks
and competencies,  each employee is evaluated and receives feedback
at least once a year.  Building on defined development goals,  we offer
and support our employees with targeted development activities both
on- and off-the-job.  Today,  PEP is consistently used in all business
units of the adidas Group.  The online version has a coverage of 76%
Group-wide.  The target for 2012 is to reach an online coverage of 96%.

Our development programmes are complemented by apprenticeship and internship programmes.  The adidas Group apprenticeship offers young people who want to join our Group directly out
of school the opportunity to gain business experience in a three-year
rotation programme.  The programme includes vocational training
in retail,  industrial management and IT,  as well as integrated study
programmes.  At the end of 2011,  we employed 76 apprentices in
Germany (2010: 58),  including 30 integrated study programme
students (2010: 18). 

ip 
The Functional Trainee Programme (FTP) is an 18-month programme
providing graduates with an international background and excellent
educational credentials the opportunity to start a functional career
within the adidas Group.  The programme comprises six three-month
assignments in various departments.  At least one of these assignments takes place abroad.  At year-end 2011,  we employed 47 participants in our global FTP (2010: 36).

In addition,  we offer tailored graduate programmes.  The Business
Management Programme (BMP),  a 24-month international,  crossfunctional and cross-brand programme,  is aimed at attracting professionals with MBA degrees and three to five years of work experience. 
The goal of this programme is to prepare them for future management
positions within our Group.  At year-end 2011,  10 employees were
participating in the BMP globally (2010: 6).

Talent management: The quality of current and future leadership
within the adidas Group is key to our success.  With specifically
designed talent management tools,  we identify employees at all
management levels of our Group who have the potential to become
future leaders within the organisation.  In order to prepare them for
more complex future roles,  they participate in targeted development
programmes   Diagram 02 :
–  xecutive Development Programme (EDP): A global programme

(cross-brand and cross-functional) for employees who show
potential for the executive level.  The programme is centrally
managed and executed. 
–  anagement Development Programme (MDP): A global programme

which is executed regionally.  This programme is tailored to
employees from different functional areas and brands that show
potential for director positions. 
–
People Manager Development Programme (PDP): A global
programme which is executed locally.  The programme targets
employees at team leader level who show potential to become
senior leaders.

The succession management process is supported by a system solution
which hosts position and employee data related to performancepotential,  career aspirations,  mobility,  etc.  Our system solution is
applied in 91% of the adidas Group business units.  The target for 2012
is to reach a full Group-wide online coverage. 

Profit participation programme: For employees at our Group
headquarters and our other locations in Germany who do not
participate in the bonus programme,  we have introduced a profit
participation programme called the 'Champions Bonus". 
Additional compensation components: For senior management and
Executive Board members,  we offer Long-Term Incentive Programmes
(LTIP).  Other benefits include our 401-K pension plans in the USA and
the adidas Group pension plan for our employees in Germany.  In 20112220 employees participated in the latter,  which represents about
51% of all eligible employees. 
Our Group subsidiaries also grant a variety of benefits to employees
depending upon locally defined practices and country-specific
regulation and norms. 

Internal communication activities to drive
employee engagement 
Performance-driven remuneration system
We are committed to rewarding our employees with compensation
and benefit programmes that are competitive in the marketplace. 
Remuneration throughout the Group comprises fixed and variable
monetary compensation,  non-monetary rewards,  as well as other
intangible benefits.  The cornerstone of our rewards programme is our
Global Salary Management System which is used as a basis for establishing and evaluating the value of employees' positions and salaries
in a market-driven and performance-oriented way.  In addition to a
fixed base salary,  we offer our employees various variable compensation components. 

We believe that a robust internal communication platform is essential
for driving employee engagement and fostering open collaboration
within our organisation.  For example,  the Group Intranet has been
transformed over the past few years into blogs,  allowing departments and teams to quickly build and edit their own internal communication platforms.  It also enables employees to comment on newsshare knowledge,  collaborate and discuss current topics.  Since 2010a Group-wide idea forum allows our employees to receive recognition for their ideas and participate in the implementation process. 
For 2011,  our focus was on knowledge management and collaboration.  We started to implement a Microsoft SharePoint platformwhich will enable us to have one global,  integrated tool for knowledge
management.  This is part of a longer-term project to create a modern
and continual learning organisation.

Succession management: The adidas Group succession management
approach aims to ensure business continuity.  We achieve this through
 globally consistent succession plan which covers successors for
director level positions and above.  These positions and the respective
successors are regularly discussed by senior management.  The
succession management information shows a clear picture of the
successor readiness and development needs.  Based upon this information,  we draft individual development plans to prepare the successor
for their potential next tasks.  In addition,  we use the successor information to create dynamic talent pools which provide us with further
flexibility in our succession management process.  All information is
consolidated in a succession management risk analysis. 

Bonus programme: In order to allow our employees to participate in
the Group's success,  and to reward them for their target achievementwe have implemented a Global Bonus Programme.  This programme
combines individual performance (measured in the PEP process) and
corporate performance (actual financial results measured against
Group,  brand,  channel,  division and/or business unit targets). 

20

Our global internship programme offers students three to six months
of work experience within the adidas Group.  It plays a key role in our
recruiting strategy.  At the end of 2011,  we employed 330 interns in
Germany (2010: 331).

Creating an attractive work environment
We aim to harmonise the commercial interests of the adidas Group
with the private and family needs of our employees.  Our Work-Life
Integration Programme includes family-oriented services,  flexible
work time and place,  people development and leadership competence
related to work-life integration.

Diverse workforce to achieve global goals: As a global companywe understand that it takes people with different ideas,  strengthsinterests and cultural backgrounds to ensure we achieve our goals.  A
high degree of diversity is already represented within our workforce. 
At our Group's global headquarters,  for example,  we have employees
from more than 60 nations.  We act to assure an environment that
embraces diversity through various initiatives,  such as networking
events,  intercultural training and the activities of our work-life
integration department. 
Increasing proportion of women in management positions: The
adidas Group has set specific goals which are in line with our
corporate culture as well as our employee structure.  We plan to
increase the proportion of women in management to between 32%
and 35% by 2015 (currently: 27% worldwide)   Table 03.  To reach this
goal,  we are increasing the proportion of women in our leadership
development programmes to 35% in order to support our female
employees to take leadership positions in all areas of the company.  At
the beginning of the year,  the Supervisory Board of adidas AG already
committed to increase the degree of female representation to at least
three female members at the next election in 2014,  with at least one to
be on the shareholders' side   see Supervisory Board Report,  p.  40.  In additionthe adidas Group is focusing on programmes which give employees
with children the option to combine their careers with family liferegardless of gender.  For example,  since 2002,  more than 70 children
have been able to attend a child-care facility at our company premises
in Canton,  USA,  and a day-care centre for 100 children is scheduled to
open in 2013 at the Group's global headquarters in HerzogenaurachGermany. 

Diverse sports activities for employees: In addition,  we offer our
employees a wide range of sports activities at our major sites,  in
which partly also their partners and family members can participate. 
Employees in Herzogenaurach,  Portland,  Canton and at other subsidiaries have access to a company gym and numerous other sports
facilities.  Our Company Sports department in Herzogenaurach also
organises various team and individual sports activities such as Nordic
walking,  mountain biking,  kayaking,  yoga or ski tours.  Special events
such as a one-week sports camp for employees' children,  trans-alpine
mountain bike tours and the annual Berlin Marathon weekend (with
 suitable training programme prior to the event) are also available. 
Even current trends such as CrossFit,  zumba and sling training as
well as special workshops like photography courses and nutrition
seminars are included in the programme.  In 2011,  the Company
Sports department in Germany offered 226 courses and 34 eventswhich were attended by more than 3900 participants (2010: >3600).

On December 31,  2011,  the Group had 46824 employees,  which
represents an increase of 10% versus 42541 in the previous year 
 Diagram 04.  This development is primarily related to the expansion of the
Group's own-retail activities in emerging markets.  An increase in the
sales force as well as additional hirings within our Global Operations
function,  in order to support the Group's sales growth,  also contributed
to the overall increase in the number of employees.  Furthermore,  a

Being an 'employer of choice"

20

106

The so-called 'war for talent" continues to be a forefront issue. 
Top-calibre talent is a premium around the world.  More than ever,  we
challenge ourselves to do what it takes to be and remain the employer
of choice.  During 2011,  we again received some highly rated rankings
as an employer of choice,  proving that the adidas Group is one of the
leading employers for school leavers and students/graduates.  In
order to further strengthen this position,  we continued to push our
activities at schools and universities throughout 2011,  to foster our
strong employer image through direct contact with top graduates and
students.  Members of the Executive Board and other senior executives
of the Group shared their business insights at selected top universities
and business schools such as the London Business School,  the IESE
in Barcelona and universities in Germany such as in Mannheim and
Nuremberg. 

Looking further to the future,  as part of our Group-wide strategic
business plan Route 2015,  Human Resources will also further build
upon existing programmes and concepts,  adding new capabilities to
enhance our performance,  learning and leadership culture.  Through
specific initiatives and workstreams,  we are looking at new and
innovative ways to incentivise and reward our employees,  based upon
performance criteria.  In addition,  we are looking at ways to ensure that
we begin training,  developing and building the skills and competencies
that will be necessary for the future,  whilst also developing a better
understanding of the company,  the employee and the consumer of the
future.  All these will combine to form the backbone of a progressive
and pro-active Human Resources programme that will play a strong
contributing role to the ongoing success of the adidas Group. 

When it comes to highly qualified personnel,  the adidas Group
continues to face increasing competition in the international labour
market.  We will continue to give priority attention to this challenge with
innovative programmes,  such as the Employee Referral Programme
which was introduced in 2010 and will be further expanded in 2012.

Sustainability
The adidas Group is responsible and accountable for developing and implementing sustainable business
practices that adhere to our operational needs as well as our social and environmental obligations.  As a
consequence,  we continuously engage with our various stakeholders in a collaborative way with the goal
of enhancing the social and environmental performance of the Group.  We believe that acting as a good
corporate citizen will improve our reputation and hence our economic value. 

At the adidas Group,  we openly engage with numerous stakeholdersinvolving them in key social and environmental decisions that shape
day-to-day operations.  Through active participation in,  for example,  the
Better Cotton Initiative,  the Sustainable Apparel Coalition,  the Leather
Working Group and the AFIRM Working Group,  we work closely with
leading companies from a variety of sectors to develop sustainable
business approaches and to debate social and environmental topics
on a global level.  This is also supported by our membership in
organisations such as the World Business Council for Sustainable
Development (WBCSD),  the World Federation of the Sporting Goods
Industry (WFSGI),  the Fair Factories Clearinghouse (FFC) and the
Fair Labor Association (FLA).  In addition,  we recognise that open and
honest communication enhances the transparency of our business
and demonstrates our commitment to being accountable. 

Workplace Standards set rules in the supply chain
We have a responsibility to our employees and the workers in our
suppliers' factories as well as the environment.  Malpractice in these
areas,  in particular human rights violations and dubious employment
practices,  can have a significant impact on the reputation and
operational efficiency of our Group and our suppliers.  Thereforecovering labour rights,  health and safety,  and environmental
protection at our own sites and our suppliers' factories is of the
highest importance to us.  We have defined rules or standards
embedding our own corporate values as well as those society expects
of global businesses.  These standards follow International Labour
Organization (ILO) and United Nations conventions relating to human
rights and employment practices,  as well as the WFSGI model code of
conduct.  We have condensed our rules into a supplier code of conduct
that we call our 'Workplace Standards".  These Standards help us
select manufacturing partners and serve as guiding principles in the
early identification and treatment of potential issues of concern at our
suppliers' sites. 

More information on the following topics is available on our website at
: www, adidas-Group, com/sustainability :
–  Our Group's sustainability programme
–  Sustainability targets and progress
–  Stakeholder engagement
–  The 'Better Place" programme
–  Performance data
–  Our Group's Environmental Strategy 
To illustrate how suppliers should implement our Standards,  we have
created a set of detailed guidelines for use in factory settings,  which
are updated on a regular basis by our Social and Environmental Affairs
(SEA) team.  The guidelines are also used to determine suppliers'
compliance with our Standards and to advise and train our suppliers
in improving their social and environmental performance. 

Careful supplier selection
To improve working conditions throughout our supply chain,  the
Group function Global Operations works closely with our SEA team on
supplier selection.  The SEA team assesses all potential new suppliersand orders can only be placed with a new supplier when SEA approval
has been granted. 

Encouraging self-governance
We help our core business partners in establishing management
systems with internationally recognised standards such as ISO 14001
for environmental management or OHSAS 18000 for health and safety
management systems as we believe good management systems help
factories improve their day-to-day operations and support the process
of self-governance.  By running a certified management systemour suppliers demonstrate commitment to continuously enhancing
their performance.  We help them build or improve human resources
systems to maintain proper working conditions,  including factory
grievance systems to routinely find and fix non-compliance issues. 
Furthermore,  by enforcing employment standards at the sites of our
manufacturing suppliers,  we empower workers to protect their own
rights and take an active role in decision-making.

Our SEA team offers specific training courses and workshops for
factory supervisors and managers to help them apply our Standards
and implement best practices.  These workshops include,  for
example,  introductory training on our Workplace Standards and
SEA operating guidelines and detailed training on effective healthsafety and environmental practices.  Furthermore,  we promote
the establishment of structures that actively involve workers and
management of our suppliers,  as well as local employee associations
and non-governmental organisations (NGOs).  In order to strengthen
personnel capacities throughout our company,  our SEA team
also organises workshops for licensees,  agents and adidas Group
business entities.  In this way,  the consideration of acceptable working
conditions becomes a routine part of business activities.  In 2011,  the
SEA team conducted 170 training sessions and workshops (2010: 193)

Number of factory visits 
The SEA team assesses compliance with our Workplace Standards
by means of factory inspections.  Our auditors check performance
against a customised risk list for each factory that is monitored.  The
methodology is linked to a factory rating which measures the effectiveness of compliance systems and the work of their administrators. 
This enables us to precisely determine training needs at our suppliers'
factories.  During 2011,  we conducted 1591 factory visits (2010: 1451
visits) involving management and worker interviews,  document
reviews,  facility inspections and training sessions at different levels in
our supply chain   Diagram 02. 
In addition to our own monitoring activities,  we value independent
and unannounced assessment by third parties to demonstrate the
credibility of and provide verified information about our programme
to stakeholders.  As a member of the Fair Labor Association (FLA)the adidas Group is subject to external assessment by independent
monitors,  participation in the FLA third-party complaint system and
public reporting.  In 2008,  the monitoring programme of the adidas
Group was re-accredited by the FLA.  This decision was based on
independent factory monitoring and verification reports of supplier
facilities,  and a thorough audit of monitoring protocols,  training
programmes and auditing systems.  The next review and accreditation cycle is scheduled for 2012.  Since joining the FLA,  more than
280 Independent External Monitoring (IEM) audits and verification
visits have been conducted at adidas Group suppliers.

Warning-letter system to enforce compliance
Where a manufacturing supplier is performing poorly in terms of
Workplace Standards compliance,  we will work closely with them to
find solutions.  However,  when we find ongoing and serious instances
of non-compliance and a lack of commitment from factory management
to address the issues,  we send out a formal warning letter including
 notification to factory management that their business relationship
with the adidas Group is in jeopardy.  Three warning letters result in
 termination.  In 2011,  we terminated our business relationship with
13 suppliers for compliance reasons (2010: 0 terminations). 

Strategic approach to driving environmental progress and
tackling climate change
Tackling climate change poses a number of challenges for our
company and our manufacturing partners.  As a result of an analysis of
our environmental impacts,  we have put the Environmental Strategy
2015 in place.  The Strategy is targeted to substantially improve our
environmental footprint.  This will enable us to offer more sustainable
products to our consumers.  The Strategy follows a vision and mission
and sets clear targets to be reached by 2015.  These targets cover
our whole value chain across all management processes,  reaching
from product design and creation to sourcing and manufacturing to
our stores and all other points of sale.  The focus is on energy,  water
conservation and discharge,  waste and chemicals,  and on becoming
more thoughtful and efficient in using resources as well as helping
reduce operational costs.  More details on our Environmental Strategy
can be found on our website at  :  www, adidas-Group, com/sustainability.

028   Sustainability 
As part of this initiative,  we have set Group-wide and site-specific
2015 targets related to carbon emissions,  savings in energy,  water
and paper consumption as well as sourcing green energy.  One of
the key goals within the Green Company initiative has been to obtain
ISO 14001 certification for environmental management systems
established at six major administration sites of the adidas Group.  This
was already achieved for five major sites in 2010,  all located in North
America (Portland,  Carlsbad,  Canton,  Montreal and Spartanburg). 
The certification of the adidas Group Headquarters site 'World of
Sports" in Herzogenaurach,  Germany,  and our Distribution Centre in
Indianapolis,  USA,  was achieved in 2011. 

Sustainable materials
One key goal of our Environmental Strategy is to reduce the overall
environmental impact of materials used in our products.  We aim
to find materials that will reduce waste or have less of an impact
throughout their whole life cycle.  The adidas Group has various
initia­
tives in place that help to achieve its goal to increase the
usage of sustainable materials.  One example is the participation in
the Better Cotton Initiative which the adidas Group co-founded.  We
are committed to using 100% Better Cotton by 2018 in all of our
products.  Better Cotton can be described as sustainable cotton
going mainstream,  i, e.  decreasing negative impacts of growing
cotton by cutting water consumption considerably and addressing
pesticide management,  crop rotation and sound working conditions. 
In 2012,  we will continue to launch products containing Better Cotton. 
More information about Better Cotton can be found on our website
at :  www, adidas-Group, com/sustainability. 
One example of how sustainable materials,  environmental design and
manufacturing are implemented is the adidas 'Better Place" concept. 
The adidas brand consolidates its sustainable product research and
development within this sustainable product creation programme.  The
first adidas 'Better Place" products were introduced globally in 2009
in response to increasing consumer demand for sustainable sports
apparel and footwear.  The products feature environmentally innovative
design,  construction,  material composition and packaging that distinguish them as environmentally preferred.  All materials that are used
for 'Better Place" have to pass an in-depth assessment. 

adidas reached a considerable milestone with all global footwear
products created in 2011 either reaching or exceeding the baseline
'Better Place" criteria.  Along with strong performance in apparel,  this
represents a considerable increase in 'Better Place" products during
the year.  This growth is supported by ongoing innovation in the area
of sustainable product construction and manufacturing techniquessuch as the zero-waste hot-runner injection technologies used on
several 2011 running footwear models.  Hot runners are a technology
brought over from the automotive industry,  where injectable materials
travel through a heated channel directly from the machine into the
mould,  only using the amount of material needed,  and resulting in no
production overflow from the mould.  We see sizeable business opportunities for our Group in the area of sustainable product concepts 
 see Risk and Opportunity Report,  p.  145,  and have already planned increased
growth in the sustainable product segment as well as a rise in
consumer engagement in the topic for 2012. 

Driving environmental improvements in our supply chain
In the supply chain,  activities focus on helping suppliers establish
sound environmental management systems at their manufacturing
plants to best reduce their negative environmental impacts.  We
have guidelines and training programmes in place for our suppliersusing the environmental performance of our own production sites as
examples of best practice. 
The majority of our footwear sourcing volume is produced in factories
which are OHSAS 18000 and/or ISO 14001 certified.  The remaining
part of our footwear sourcing volume is produced in factories that
have management systems in place but have not been certified.  All
footwear factories are regularly assessed against the adidas Group's
standards on environment and workplace health and safety.  A range of
other activities have been implemented to reduce our carbon footprint
in the supply and distribution chain.  Examples of these are in the
areas of transportation and energy use.  In the transportation of our
products,  our policy is to minimise the impacts,  in particular from air
freight shipments,  through improved order and production planning
tools.

An important part of our Group's Environmental Strategy is the Green
Company initiative,  which targets reducing the environmental footprint
of our own sites.  The initiative provides a supporting frameworkguidance and communication platform for all Group entities to

Case study on the London 2012 Olympic Games
Global sports events,  such as the FIFA World Cup or the Olympic Games,  place considerable attention on the host countries,  the event
organisers and their major partners.  This increased attention also raises questions about how events are organised and how the involved
parties manage their wider social and environmental responsibilities.

The London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) issued a Sustainable Sourcing Code to its partners.  The
code clearly outlines four key principles for commercial partners to follow:
–  esponsible sourcing ensuring that products and services are sourced and produced under a set of internationally acceptable environR
mental,  social and ethical guidelines and standards
–  ustainable product creation maximising the use of materials with reused and recycled content,  minimising packaging and designing

products that can either be reused or recycled

–  inimising embodied impacts maximising resource and energy efficiency in the manufacturing and supply process in order to minimise
environmental impacts

–  sage of healthy materials ensuring that appropriate substances and materials are used in order to protect human health and the
environment
Commercial partners are contractually bound to abide by LOCOG's policies and requirements.  This includes the disclosure of all factories
manufacturing London 2012 products and registering those factory premises on the Supplier Ethical Data Exchange (SEDEX). 

How adidas is prepared to meet the code:
Responsible sourcing practices
All direct suppliers and sewing subcontractors selected to
manufacture LOCOG licensed products
–  re required to meet the adidas Group's Workplace Standards

–  re fully disclosed in SEDEX

– re subject to regular labour,  health and safety compliance

inspections by adidas Group SEA compliance staff
–  eet a defined Key Performance Indicator (KPI) rating for

factories' compliance performance
– ave a management plan in place that details the factory's

compliance programme and future targets
–  re publicly disclosed on the adidas Group website
 
Sustainable product creation
90% of the adidas products for the London 2012 Olympic Games
contain sustainable content,  with 100% of athlete Village wear100% of Volunteer wear and 73% of on-field performance products
designed and developed as 'Better Place".  The London Volunteers'
uniform is a prime example.  All items in the Volunteer package
contain,  at a minimum,  35% sustainable content,  with three 
quarters of the Volunteer clothing and accessories at sustainability
levels beyond 50%.  Additionally,  all Volunteers will be wearing the
London version of the popular Fluid Trainer shoe.  The Fluid Trainer
is technically advanced in the area of sustainability,  with pattern
innovations and sustainable content that impact the whole shoe. 
This shoe contains recycled polyester mesh,  recycled EVA,  as well
as recycled rubber,  and has achieved a 70% or greater pattern
efficiency for every piece of the upper. 

Minimising embodied impact
All direct suppliers selected to manufacture adidas branded
LOCOG licensed products and their major materials suppliers
undergo in-depth environmental assessments.  These are used for
the development of individual factory improvement programmes. 
The factories' progress is going to be tracked regularly. 

Usage of healthy materials
LOCOG licensed products comply with the adidas Group's restricted
substances list and are in compliance with standards listed in the
LOCOG Sourcing Code.

Strong sustainability track record reflected in index
memberships
Interest from the financial community in sustainability management
is steadily increasing.  We appreciate positive recognition from international institutions and rating agencies,  NGOs and socially responsible investment (SRI) analysts.  Each year,  we respond to numerous
enquiries from socially responsible investors,  fund managers and
financial analysts.  They evaluate our efforts through in-depth analysis
of our sustainability programme,  including document review as well
as interviews with employees and management.  As a result,  adidas
AG has been included in a variety of high-profile sustainability indices 
  adidas AG in sustainability indices. 

Reducing VOC emissions
Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs),  which are typically found in
solvents used in our manufacturing process,  can,  in a high concentration,  cause breathing difficulties and other health problems for
production workers.  Therefore,  for more than a decade,  we have been
requesting our footwear suppliers to reduce the use of VOCs in their
manufacturing. 
By applying innovative and environmentally sound bonding and priming
technologies and following the adidas Group guidelines on the use of
chemicals,  it has been possible for our athletic footwear suppliers in
Asia and Europe to reduce the use of VOCs from well above 100 grams
per pair down to below 30 grams,  for a short period even to 20 grams. 
However,  in the last two to three years,  we have seen a slight increase. 
The reason is that some new footwear constructions,  such as outdoor
models need organic solvents in order to maintain high performance
standards under outdoor conditions.  The technical reason is the
stronger bonding needed between different footwear parts,  which can
only be obtained with solvent-based primers and adhesives.

We have specified clear standards that follow the strictest local regulations and best practice standards for consumer care and safety.  This
policy is mandatory for all business partners and is updated regularly
based on findings in our ongoing dialogue with scientific organisations.  Our standards cover the general requirements for eco-labels
and green seals (e.g.  ÖKO-Tex Standard 100,  Toxproof TÜV Rheinlandetc. ) for footwear,  apparel and hardware products.  Both our own
quality assurance laboratories and external testing institutes are used
to constantly monitor material samples to ensure supplier compliance
with these requirements.  Materials that do not meet our standards
and specifications are rejected.

Internal Group Management System
The principal financial goal for increasing shareholder value at the adidas Group is maximising operating
cash flow.  We strive to achieve this goal by continually improving our top- and bottom-line performance
while at the same time optimising the use of invested capital.  Our Group's planning and controlling system
is therefore designed to provide a variety of tools to assess our current performance and to align future
strategic and investment decisions to best utilise commercial and organisational opportunities. 

20

Operating cash flow as Internal Group Management focus
We believe operating cash flow is the most important driver to increase
shareholder value.  Operating cash flow is comprised of operating
profit,  change in operating working capital and net investments
(capital expenditure less depreciation and amortisation)   Diagram 01. 
To maximise operating cash flow generation across our organisationmanagement of our operating segments together with management
at market level have responsibility for improving operating profit as
well as optimising operating working capital and capital expenditure. 
To keep senior management focused on long-term performance
improvements we have adopted a modified economic value added (EVA)
model.  The asset base of a market or operating unit within the Group
is subject to a percentage capital charge to the operating profit of the
respective business unit.  The asset base includes operating working
capital as well as other assets needed by a market or operating unit in
its day-to-day operations.  The resulting internal KPI is called Contribution After Capital Charge (CACC) and is used as one of the primary
targets for the variable component of managers' compensation.  This
concept has been in place Group-wide since 2010.

Operating
cash flow 
Operating margin as important KPI of operational
progress
Operating margin (defined as operating profit as a percentage of net
sales) is our Group's most important measure of operational success. 
It highlights the quality of our top line and operational efficiency.  The
primary drivers central to enhancing operating margin are:
–  ales and gross margin development: Management focuses on

identifying and exploiting opportunities that not only provide for
future growth,  but also have potential to increase gross margin
(defined as gross profit as a percentage of net sales).  Major levers
for enhancing our Group's sales and gross margin include:
–  ptimising our product mix

– ncreasing the quality of distribution,  with a particular focus on

controlled space
–  inimising clearance activities

–  ealising supply chain efficiency initiatives

– perating expense control: We put high emphasis on tightly

controlling operating expenses to leverage the Group's sales
growth through to the bottom line.  This requires a particular focus
on ensuring flexibility in the Group's cost base.  Marketing working
budget is our largest operating expense.  It is one of the most
important mechanisms for driving top-line growth sustainably. 
Therefore,  we are committed to improving the utilisation of our
marketing expenditure.  This includes concentrating our communication efforts (including advertising,  retail presentation and public
relations) on key global brand initiatives and focusing our promotion
spend on well-selected partnerships with top events,  leagues,  clubs
and athletes. 
We also aim to increase operational efficiency and reduce operating
overhead expenses as a percentage of sales.  In this respect,  we
regularly review our operational structure streamlining business
processes,  eliminating redundancies and leveraging the scale of our
organisation.  These measures may also be supplemented by shortterm initiatives such as temporarily curtailing operational investments,  for example staff hiring. 

  adidas Group 
2011 Annual Report 
  Group M a n a gemen t Report Fin a nci a l Re v ie w 
031    Internal Group Management System 
Our Group also puts a high priority on the optimisation of non-operating
components such as financial result and taxes,  as these items strongly
impact the Group's cash outflows and therefore the Group's free cash
flow.  Financial expenses are managed centrally by our Group Treasury
department   see Treasury,  p.  129.  The Group's current and future tax
expenditure is optimised globally by our Group Taxes department. 

Tight operating working capital management
Due to a comparatively low level of fixed assets required in our
business,  the efficiency of the Group's balance sheet depends to a large
degree on our operating working capital management.  Our key metric
is operating working capital as a percentage of net sales.  Monitoring
the development of this key metric facilitates the measurement of
our progress in improving the efficiency of our business cycle.  We
have significantly enhanced operating working capital management
over recent years through improvement of our Group's inventoriesaccounts receivable and accounts payable. 
We strive to manage our inventory levels to meet market demand and
ensure fast replenishment.  Inventory ageing is controlled to reduce
inventory obsolescence and to optimise clearance activities.  As a
result,  stock turn development is the key performance indicator as
it measures the number of times average inventory is sold during a
year,  highlighting the efficiency of capital locked up in products.  To
minimise capital tied up in accounts receivable,  we strive to improve
collection efforts in order to reduce the Days of Sales Outstanding
(DSO) and improve the ageing of accounts receivable.  Likewise,  we
strive to optimise payment terms with our suppliers to best manage
our accounts payable. 

Improving the effectiveness of the Group's capital expenditure is
another lever to maximise our operating cash flow.  We control capital
expenditure with a top-down,  bottom-up approach.  In a first stepGroup Management defines focus areas and an overall investment
budget based on investment requests from various functions of the
organisation.  Our operating units then align their initiatives within
the scope of assigned priorities and available budget.  We evaluate
potential return on planned investments utilising the net present
value method.  Risk is accounted for,  adding a risk premium to the cost
of capital and thus reducing our estimate of future earnings streams
where appropriate.  By means of scenario planning,  the sensitivity of
investment returns is tested against changes in initial assumptions. 
For large investment projects,  timelines and deviations versus budget
are monitored on a monthly basis throughout the course of the project. 
The final step of optimising return on investments is our post-mortem
analysis process,  where in particular larger projects are evaluated
and learnings are documented to be available for future strategic or
operational capital expenditure decisions. 

M&A activities focus on long-term value creation
potential
We see the majority of the Group's future growth opportunities
coming from our existing portfolio of brands.  However,  as part of
our commitment to ensuring sustainable profitable developmentwe regularly review merger and acquisition (M&A) options that
may provide additional commercial and operational opportunities. 
Acquisitive growth focus is primarily related to improving the Group's
positioning within a sports category,  strengthening our technology
portfolio or addressing new consumer segments. 
The strategies of any potential acquisition candidate must correspond
with the Group's strategic direction.  Maximising return on invested
capital above the cost of capital in the long term is a core consideration in our decision-making process.  Of particular importance
is evaluating the potential impact on our Group's free cash flow.  We
assess current and future projected key financial metrics to evaluate
 target's operating profit potential.  In addition,  careful consideration
is given to potential financing needs and their impact on the Group's
financial leverage.

Furthermore,  we carefully analyse the different mix effects which
impact the Group's profit ratios,  as our business performance
differs significantly across geographical markets,  business models
and channels.  The strategic implications and decisions taken in this
respect are a key element of our strategic planning efforts,  ensuring
clarity and focus of the organisation to maximise the Group's
operating margin.

Key financial metrics

Creating value for our shareholders by earning a return on invested
capital above the cost of that capital is a guiding principle of our Group
strategy.  We source capital from equity and debt markets.  Thereforewe have a responsibility that our return on capital meets the expectations of both equity shareholders and creditors.  We calculate the
cost of capital utilising the weighted average cost of capital (WACC)
formula.  This metric allows us to calculate the minimum required
financial returns of planned capital investments.  The cost of equity is
computed utilising the risk-free rate,  market risk premium and beta
factor.  Cost of debt is calculated using the risk-free rate,  credit spread
and average tax rate. 

Structured performance measurement system
We have developed an extensive performance measurement systemwhich utilises a variety of tools to measure the performance of the
adidas Group.  The Group's key financial metrics are monitored
and compared against budget as well as a rolling forecast on a
monthly basis.  The focus is on operating cash flow,  CACC,  salesoperating margin,  operating working capital and net debt development   Diagram 02.  When negative deviations exist between actual
and target numbers,  we perform a detailed analysis to identify and
address the cause.  If necessary,  action plans are implemented to
optimise the develop­ ent of the Group's operating performance.  We

also benchmark the Group's financial results with those of our major
competitors on a quarterly basis.  To assess current sales and profitability development,  Management analyses sell-through information
from our own-retail activities as well as short-term replenishment
orders from retailers. 
Taking into account year-to-date performance as well as opportunities
and risks,  the Group's full year financial performance is forecasted
on a monthly basis.  In this respect,  backlogs comprising orders
received up to nine months in advance of the actual sale are also used
as an indicator.  However,  due to the growing share of own retail in
our business mix as well as fluctuating order patterns among our
wholesale partners,  our order books are less indicative of anticipated
revenues compared to the past.  Therefore,  qualitative feedback from
our retail partners on the success of our collections at the point of sale
as well as data received from our own retail are becoming even more
important.  Finally,  as a further early indicator for future performancewe also conduct market research to better measure brand appealbrand awareness and resulting purchase intent.

Enhanced integrated planning and management
approach
In order to further improve profitability and working capital efficiency
as well as operating cash flow development,  in 2011 we started to
introduce an enhanced forecasting approach around full integration of
the major business functions such as marketing,  sales and operations
at a market and global level.  The centre-point of this approach is
improving the accuracy of future business planning,  leading to a new
efficiency level of order book building and conversion.  We connect
all relevant financial KPIs with the corresponding operational KPIsresulting in a comprehensive understanding of all interdependencies. 
The whole process is set up in a rhythm and timeframe to facilitate
full management alignment and forecasting clarity in advance of
important business decision processes in particular those related
to product pricing,  range building,  material purchasing or production
capacities.  To create a seamless flow between achieving our strategic
objectives and implementing operational plans,  we follow a rolling
two-year time horizon.  All target-setting is fully embedded into the
integrated planning process and communicated in advance of all
relevant business decision processes.

Operations Review 
Our expectations for the Group's business performance in 2012 are
based on continued global economic growth,  albeit at a slightly lower
rate than in 2011,  as well as a further strengthening of our business
in the emerging markets.  Through our industry-leading innovation
strength,  the extensive pipeline of new and fresh products,  which
have received favourable reviews from retailers,  as well as positive
effects from major sporting events,  we project top- and bottom-line
improvements in our Group's financial results in 2012.  Profitability
improvements,  however,  will be dampened by continuing pressure on
raw material and labour costs which our industry is facing.  In 2013
and beyond,  assuming no deterioration in the global economy,  we are
confident to further increase sales and earnings per share as outlined

118

In 2011,  the adidas Group delivered a strong financial performance.  Currency-neutral Group sales
increased 13% as a result of double-digit growth in the Wholesale and Retail segments as well as in Other
Businesses.  In euro terms,  adidas Group revenues grew 11% to € 13344 billion from € 11990 billion in
2010.  The Group's gross margin decreased 03 percentage points to 475% (2010: 478%),  as the increase in
input costs more than offset the positive impact from a more favourable product and regional sales mix as
well as a larger share of higher-margin Retail sales.  The Group's gross profit rose 11% to € 6344 billion
in 2011 versus € 5730 billion in 2010.  The Group's operating margin was up 01 percentage points to 76%
from 75% in 2010.  This was primarily due to the positive effects from lower other operating expenses as
a percentage of sales,  which more than offset a decrease in gross margin and in other operating income. 
The Group's operating profit grew 13% to € 1011 billion in 2011 versus € 894 million in 2010.  The Group's
net income attributable to shareholders increased 18% to € 671 million from € 567 million in 2010.  Basic
and diluted earnings per share grew 18% to € 320 in 2011 versus € 271 in 2010. 

Economic and Sector Development
Global economy expands 27% in 2011
In 2011,  global GDP growth moderated to 27%,  compared to 41% in
the prior year.  The emerging markets grew significantly faster than
the developed economies,  expanding 60% and 16% respectively. 
Economic expansion was mainly driven by industrial activity and
domestic consumption in the emerging markets,  particularly in China
and India.  However,  the European debt crisis,  the downgrade of the
sovereign ratings of many major economies,  the effect of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan,  as well as political revolutions in many
Arab countries were all major challenges for and disruptions to global
economic activity during the year. 
In Western Europe,  GDP increased 15% (2010: 19%),  driven in
particular by Germany's domestic consumption and exports.  The euro
debt crisis remained a key challenge for the region,  as political uncertainty on finding a resolution,  acute austerity measures and fiscal
tightening inhibited confidence and economic activity. 
European emerging markets' GDP growth kept pace with the prior
year at around 45% (2010: 44%).  Despite the negative effects from
the euro debt crisis and high unemployment levels in many marketsstrong domestic demand and exports positively impacted economic
growth.  Russia in particular benefited from high oil prices and
increased output. 

In the USA,  GDP increased 18% compared to 30% in the prior year. 
High fuel prices and the uncertainties created by the deficit reduction
debate were both negatives on consumer confidence and business
sentiment in the first half of the year.  However,  consumer spending
and business hiring revived,  albeit somewhat modestly,  in the second
half of the year,  driven by a decline in energy prices,  pent-up demand
and further monetary easing.  Despite evidence that the residential
real estate market had begun to stabilise,  imbalances in the mortgage
market and relatively high unemployment levels continued to limit
spending in many households.

In Latin America,  full year GDP increased 42% (2010: 67%). 
Relatively low unemployment levels and wage growth helped support
consumption and domestic demand in the region.  However,  falling
demand from the USA and Europe began to impact growth in exports
and production as the year progressed.

 uarterly development of Consumer Price Index 1) 
(by region)

Positive growth in the global sporting goods industry
In 2011,  the global sporting goods industry outperformed overall
economic development.  Growth was driven in particular by robust
consumer spending in the emerging markets,  which offset subdued
consumer confidence and private spending in some Western
European markets and in Japan.  A number of regional sporting events
also contributed to the industry's development in certain marketsincluding the Rugby World Cup in New Zealand,  the Copa América
in Argentina,  the IAAF World Championships in South Korea and the
Cricket World Cup in India,  Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.  While high
commodity prices negatively impacted the industry,  many suppliers
and retailers focused on premium and innovative products to protect
profitability and support margins. 
From a category perspective,  running was the biggest growth driversupported by the popularity of lightweight running footwear and highperformance apparel products.  The minimalist and barefoot footwear
categories also recorded strong growth.  Additionally,  the outdoor
category (especially performance fleece and base layer products) and
training posted robust sales increases. 
Another major highlight for the industry in 2011 was the rapid rise
in sales via e-commerce platforms and the expansion of activities in
digital,  mobile and social media.  In addition,  the pace of consolidation
in the industry increased in 2011,  with several acquisitions,  both on a
manufacturer and a retailer level,  during the year.

In 2011,  Asian economies,  excluding Japan,  continued to post the
highest global GDP growth rates,  increasing 72% (2010: 90%). 
Including Japan,  Asian GDP growth was approximately 39% (2010:
67%).  In China,  GDP grew 89%,  supported by rising incomes and
strong domestic demand.  India's GDP grew 75%,  with the falling
value of the rupee supporting healthy export activity.  Japan's economy
rebounded in the second half of 2011,  as industrial output swiftly
recouped lost ground and the government introduced generous public
reconstruction programmes.  However,  a strengthened yen weakened
exports,  which constrained private investment and weighed negatively
on domestic demand,  resulting in an overall GDP contraction of 07%.

Modest growth of Europe's sporting goods industry 
20

11

120

In Europe,  despite austerity measures and high unemployment in
many markets,  the sporting goods industry grew modestly in 2011. 
In Western Europe,  strong consumer spending and retail activity in
Germany as well as the positive effects of the year's sporting events
on sales in France and the UK drove industry growth.  In European
emerging markets,  low unemployment rates and rising wages
supported consumer spending and confidence,  which also positively
impacted retail sales and expansion of the sporting goods sectorparticularly in Russia. 

Strong retail activity drives growth of North American
sporting goods industry
In the USA,  the sporting goods industry outperformed most other
sectors of the economy,  driven by strong underlying growth in
consumer spending,  as total consumer purchases rose 77%.  We
estimate that sporting goods sales increased at a high-single-digit
rate in 2011,  driven by improvements in average selling prices,  with
many sporting goods retailers focusing on premium and innovative
products.  Footwear sales are estimated to have increased at a
high-single-digit rate in 2011,  driven in particular by growth in the
running and training categories.  However,  the US toning market saw
 significant decline in 2011,  with the effect of inventory overhang and
extensive discounting negatively impacting this category.  The NBA
lockout and the delayed start of the season had little impact on sales
in the basketball category. 

International brands drive Asian sporting goods
industry expansion 
Latin America's sporting goods industry records
strong momentum
In Latin America,  solid consumer spending and retail activity
supported growth in the industry,  which increased at a high-singledigit rate in 2011.  This was despite the tough comparisons from
lapping the positive effect of the 2010 FIFA World Cup.  The 2011 Copa
América,  held in Argentina,  supported spending on sporting goodshelping to offset this effect. 

adidas Group and competitors outperform
economic environment
adidas Group revenues and profitability as well as those of many
competitors and retailers increased in 2011.  In most regions,  sales of
our Group and other major sporting goods companies grew at a higher
rate than GDP and overall consumer spending.

Strong wage growth and consumer spending supported increases in
Asia's sporting goods industry,  which grew at a high-single-digit rate
in 2011.  Growth in China's sportswear industry was mainly driven by
international brands,  as over-expansion,  declining brand image and
over-inventory issues negatively impacted many domestic players. 
In India,  the 2011 Cricket World Cup,  jointly hosted by India (eventual
winners),  Sri Lanka and Bangladesh,  contributed positively to growth. 
Similarly,  the 2011 IAAF World Championships in Athletics,  held in
Daegu,  South Korea,  were a successful driver of industry growth in
that market.  However,  in Japan,  the effects of the earthquake,  low
economic activity and consumer spending levels led to sales declines
in the sporting goods market.

Cost of sales increases
Cost of sales is defined as the amount we pay to third parties for
expenses associated with producing and delivering our products. 
Own-production expenses are also included in the Group's cost of
sales.  However,  these expenses represent only a very small portion
of total cost of sales.  In 2011,  cost of sales was € 7000 billion,  representing an increase of 12% compared to € 6260 billion in 2010. 
This development was mainly due to increasing sourcing volumes
in footwear,  apparel and hardware.  In addition,  the increase of input
costs as a result of higher raw material prices at the time of sourcing
negatively impacted the cost of sales development. 

The gross margin of the adidas Group decreased 03 percentage points
to 475% in 2011 (2010: 478%)   Diagram 15.  The increase in input costs
more than offset the positive impact from a more favourable product

Other operating income includes items such as gains from the
disposal of fixed assets and releases of accruals and provisions as
well as insurance compensation.  In 2011,  other operating income
decreased 10% to € 98 million (2010: € 110 million).  This was mainly
due to the non-recurrence of positive one-off effects in conjunction
with the settlement of a lawsuit and the divestiture of a trademark in
the prior year,  each of which had a positive low-double-digit million
euro impact on the Group's financial results in 2010   see Note 29,  p.  208.

Marketing working budget consists of items such as expenses for
promotion partnerships,  advertising and public relations to support
brand strength.  As marketing working budget expenses are not
distribution channel specific,  they are not allocated to the segments. 
In absolute terms,  marketing working budget increased 6% to
€ 1361 billion in 2011 from € 1288 billion in the prior year.  This was
mainly due to higher expenditures at the adidas brand related to the
launch of the 'all adidas" campaign.  In addition,  increased marketing
and promotion initiatives for new product concepts impacted this
development.  By brand,  the adidas marketing working budget
increased 9% to € 1007 billion from € 927 million in 2010.  Marketing
working budget of the Reebok brand was down 5% to € 235 million
(2010: € 247 million).  The Group's marketing working budget as
a percentage of sales decreased 05 percentage points to 102% (2010:

Operating overhead expenses decrease as a percentage
of sales
Group operating overheads include overhead costs related to
marketing,  logistics,  sales and R&D as well as central administration.  Almost half of the operating overhead expenses are related
to personnel costs.  In absolute terms,  operating overhead expenses
were up 11% to € 3825 billion in 2011 versus € 3450 billion in 2010. 
This was primarily a result of the expansion of the Group's own-retail
activities,  as well as an increase in logistic and warehouse costs. 
However,  due to increasing retail sophistication as well as ­ perational

leverage,  operating overhead expenses as a percentage of sales
decreased 01 percentage points to 287% from 288% in the prior year.

At the end of December 2011,  the Group employed 46824 people. 
This represents an increase of 10% versus the prior year level of
42541.  New hirings related to the expansion of the Group's own-retail
store base were the main driver of this development.  On a full-time
equivalent basis,  the number of employees increased 12% to 40637 at

Operating margin  (in %)

The Group's earnings before interest,  taxes,  depreciation and

on property,  plant and equipment and intangible assets (EBITDA)
increased 8% to € 1257 billion in 2011 (2010: € 1159 billion) 
 Diagram 22.  Depreciation and amortisation expense for tangible and
intangible assets with limited useful lives declined 4% to € 252 million
in 2011 (2010: € 263 million).  This development was mainly a result
of lower impairment charges in 2011 compared to the prior year.  In
accordance with IFRS,  intangible assets with indefinite useful lives
(goodwill and trademarks) are tested annually and additionally when
there are indications of potential impairment.  In this connectionno impairment of intangible assets with unlimited useful lives was
incurred in 2011 and 2010.

Other current provisions up 8%

Cash flow remains strong 
Other current provisions were up 8% to € 507 million at the end of
2011 versus € 470 million at the end of 2010.  This primarily relates to
increases in provisions for returns,  allowances and warranties   see
Note 19,  p.  194. 

In 2011,  net cash inflow from operating activities was € 792 million
(2010: € 894 million).  The decrease in cash generated from operating
activities compared to the prior year was primarily due to higher income
taxes paid,  as well as higher operating working capital requirementspartly offset by the improved Group profitability.  Net cash outflow
from investing activities was € 566 million (2010: € 330 million).  This
was mainly related to spending for property,  plant and equipment
such as investments in the furnishing and fitting of stores in our
Retail segment,  in new office buildings and in IT systems,  as well as
to the purchase of short-term financial assets and the acquisition of
Five Ten   see Note 03,  p.  188.  Net cash outflow from financing activities
­
totalled € 491 million (2010: € 238 million).  Cash outflows from
financing activities were mainly related to the repayment of shortterm borrowings totalling € 273 million,  dividends paid in an amount
of € 167 million as well as the repayment of long-term borrowings
in an amount of € 48 million.  Exchange rate effects in an amount of
€ 15 million positively impacted the Group's cash position in 2011
(2010: € 55 million).  As a result of all these developments,  cash and
cash equivalents decreased € 250 million to € 906 million at the end
of December 2011 compared to € 1156 billion at the end of December

Other current liabilities up 24%
Other current liabilities were up 24% to € 301 million at the end of

Group financing policy
In order to be able to meet the Group's payment commitments at all
times,  the major goal of our financing policy is to ensure sufficient
liquidity reserves,  while minimising the Group's financial expenses. 
The operating activities of our Group segments and markets and the
resulting cash inflows represent the Group's main source of liquidity. 
Liquidity is planned on a rolling monthly basis under a multi-year
financial and liquidity plan.  This comprises all consolidated Group
companies.  Our in-house bank concept takes advantage of any
surplus funds of individual Group companies to cover the financial
requirements of others,  thus reducing external financing needs
and optimising our net interest expenses.  By settling intercompany
transactions via intercompany financial accounts,  we are able to
reduce external bank account transactions and thus bank charges. 
Effective management of our currency exposure and interest rate
risks are additional goals and responsibilities of our Group Treasury
department. 

Treasury system and responsibilities
Our Group's Treasury Policy governs all treasury-related issuesincluding banking policy and approval of bank relationships,  global
financing arrangements and liquidity/asset management,  currency
and interest risk management as well as the management of intercompany cash flows.  Responsibilities are arranged in a three-tiered
approach:
– The Treasury Committee consists of members of the Executive Board
and other senior executives who decide on the Group's Treasury
Policy and provide strategic guidance for managing treasury-related
topics.  Major changes to our Treasury Policy are subject to the prior
approval of the Treasury Committee. 
–
The Group Treasury department is responsible for specific
centralised treasury transactions and for the global implementation
of our Group's Treasury Policy. 
– On a subsidiary level,  where applicable and economically reasonablelocal managing directors and financial controllers are responsible
for managing treasury matters in their respective subsidiaries. 
Controlling functions on a Group level ensure that the transactions
of the individual business units are in compliance with the Group's
Treasury Policy.

In accordance with our Group's Treasury Policy,  all worldwide credit
lines are directly or indirectly managed by the Group Treasury
department.  Portions of those lines are allocated to the Group's
subsidiaries and backed by adidas AG guarantees.  As a result of this
centralised liquidity management,  the Group is well positioned to
allocate resources efficiently throughout the organisation.  The Group's
debt is generally unsecured and may include standard financial
covenants,  which are reviewed on a quarterly basis.  We maintain
good relations with numerous partner banks,  thereby avoiding a high
dependency on any single financial institution.  Banking partners
of the Group and our subsidiaries are required to have at least a
BBB+ long-term investment grade rating by Standard & Poor's or an

­ quivalent rating by another leading rating agency.  Only in exceptional
cases are Group companies authorised to work with banks with a lower
rating   see Risk and Opportunity Report,  p.  145.  To ensure optimal allocation
of the Group's liquid financial resources,  subsidiaries transfer excess

The adidas Group's financial flexibility is ensured by the availability
of unutilised credit facilities in an amount of € 3898 billion at the
end of 2011 (2010: € 3934 billion).  These include a € 1860 billion
committed syndicated loan facility which was,  as in the prior yearnot utilised at year-end (2010: € 1860 billion unutilised) as well as
bilateral credit lines at different banks in an amount of € 2038 billion
(2010: € 2074 billion).  The syndicated loan facility has a remaining
time to maturity of less than one year.  The replacement of this facility
is planned during the course of 2012.  We monitor the ongoing need
for available credit lines based on the current level of debt as well as
future financing requirements.

decreased slightly to 49% in 2011 (2010: 51%)   Diagram 50.  The
positive effect from lower interest rates on short-term borrowings
was partly offset by the negative effect from local borrowings in
currencies which carry a higher average interest rate.  Fixed-rate
financing amounted to 77% of the Group's total gross borrowings at
the end of 2011 (2010: 76%).  Variable-rate financing amounted to 23%
of total gross borrowings at the end of the year (2010: 24%).

In the case of our committed credit facilities,  we have entered into
various covenants.  These covenants may include limits on the disposal
of fixed assets,  the amount of debt secured by liens,  cross default
provisions and change of control.  In addition,  certain financial arrangements contain equity ratio covenants,  minimum equity covenants as
well as net loss covenants.  If we failed to meet any covenant and were
unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of partner banks,  borrowings
would become due and payable immediately.  As at December 312011,  we were in full compliance with all of our covenants,  with ample
coverage above all stipulated minimum requirements.  As a result of
our cash flow expectations,  we are confident we will continue to be
compliant with these covenants going forward   see Subsequent Events and
Outlook,  p.  163.  We believe that cash generated from operating activitiestogether with access to external sources of funds,  will be sufficient to
meet our future operating and capital needs.

The Group ended the year with a net cash position of € 90 millioncompared to net borrowings of € 221 million at the end of the prior
year,  reflecting an improvement of € 311 million   Diagram 48.  This
development exceeded our original target of further reducing net
borrowings,  as communicated at the beginning of 2011.  Strong cash
flow from operating activities positively influenced this development. 
Currency effects had a positive impact of € 59 million on net cash
develop­ ent.  The Group's financial leverage declined to –17% at the

end of 2011 versus 48% in the prior year   Diagram 52.  At the end of
2011,  the ratio of net borrowings over EBITDA was –01 (2010: 02) and
was thus well within the Group's medium-term guideline of less than
two times.  Efficient management of our capital structure continues
to be a top management priority   see Subsequent Events and Outlook,  p.  163.

Effective currency management a key priority
As a globally operating company,  the Group is exposed to currency
risks.  Therefore,  effective currency management is a key focus of
Group Treasury,  with the aim of reducing the impact of currency
fluctuations on non-euro-denominated net future cashflows.  In this
regard,  hedging US dollars is a central part of our programme.  This
is a direct result of our Asian-dominated sourcing,  which is largely
denominated in US dollars   see Global Operations,  p.  90.  In 2011,  Group
Treasury managed a net deficit of around US  30 billion against
$
the euro,  related to operational activities (2010: US $ 21 billion).  As
governed by our Group's Treasury Policy,  we have established a rolling
12- to 24-month hedging system,  under which the vast majority of the
anticipated seasonal hedging volume is secured approximately six
months prior to the start of a season.  As a result,  we have almost
completed our anticipated hedging needs for 2012 as of year-end
2011,  and we have already started hedging our exposure for 2013. 
The rates for 2012 are slightly less favourable compared to those of
2011.  The use or combination of different hedging instruments,  such
as forward contracts,  currency options and swaps,  protects us against
unfavourable currency movements.  The use of currency options allows
us to benefit from future favourable exchange rate developments   see
Risk and Opportunity Report,  p.  145.

Net sales increase 15%
The asset and capital structure of adidas AG is significantly impacted
by its holding and financing function for the Group.  For example,  57%
of total assets in 2011 relates to financial assets,  which primarily
consist of shares in affiliated companies.  Intercompany financial
accounts,  through which transactions between affiliated companies
are settled,  represent another 28% of total assets and 49% of total
liabilities and equity as at December 31,  2011. 

Sales of adidas AG comprise external revenues from adidas and
Reebok product sales generated by adidas Germany,  external
revenues from Y-3 products as well as group-internal revenues from
foreign ­ubsidiaries.  Reported revenues also include royalty and

commission income and other revenues.  In 2011,  adidas AG net sales
grew 15% to € 1766 billion (2010: € 1540 billion).  More than half of
this increase is attributable to an increase in royalty and commission
income   Table 55. 

Preparation of accounts
Unlike the consolidated financial statements,  which are in conformity
with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS),  as
adopted by the European Union as at December 31,  2011,  the following
financial statements of adidas AG have been prepared in accordance
with the rules set out in the German Commercial Code (Handels­
gesetzbuch HGB).

Balance Sheet 
In 2011,  other operating income of adidas AG declined 2% to
€ 1254 billion.  This was primarily due to a decrease in income from
currency conversion and lower income derived from services provided
to other Group companies.  The result also reflects the conversion of
the Reebok Germany business from commission agent to principal.  In
the prior year,  this business was still being conducted by adidas AG
as commission agent; as such,  the company generated income by
passing the operational costs on to the principal.  The conversion to
principal meant that the income derived from passing on costs were
no longer achieved in 2011.

Assets 
In 2011,  other operating expenses for adidas AG rose 10% to
€ 2125 billion (2010: € 1931 billion).  The increase is largely attributable to higher marketing expenditure.  This includes an increase in
promotional and advertising expenditure to support sales growth in
Germany,  and higher expenditure for global marketing to strengthen
the adidas brand at an international level.  Losses from currency
conversion were also up,  as was expenditure for legal and other
consultancy services.

Loss from operations
In 2011,  adidas AG recorded a loss from operations in the amount of
€ 9 million compared to a profit of € 77 million in the prior year.  This
was mainly due to the increase in other operating expenses. 

Financial result increases 25%
Net interest expense of adidas AG declined 9% to € 63 million in 2011
(2010: € 69 million).  This positive development derives from interest
received from affiliated companies.  At € 40 million,  interest paid to
third parties increased € 1 million compared to the prior year. 
Income from investments in affiliated companies increased
€ 58 million to € 147 million in 2011 from € 89 million in the prior year. 
Profit and loss transfer agreements generated income of € 94 million
for adidas AG in 2011.  As a result,  the financial result of adidas AG
increased 25% to € 178 million from € 142 million in 2010. 

Net income decreases 29%
Income from ordinary activities decreased 23% to € 169 million in
2011 from € 219 million in 2010,  as increases in the financial result
were more than offset by the loss from operations.  Net income for the
year after taxes of € 58 million was € 111 million (2010: € 157 million). 

At the end of December 2011,  total assets declined 4% to € 6046 billion
versus € 6265 billion in the prior year.  The most significant changes
were in cash and cash equivalents,  which decreased € 299 million. 
This was partly offset by additions to fixed assets in an amount of
€ 54 million,  mainly due to the new 'Laces" office building,  as well
as an increase of € 27 million in receivables and other current assets. 

Shareholders' equity declines 2%
Shareholders' equity declined 2% to € 2322 billion at the end of
December 2011 versus € 2378 billion in the prior year.  The decrease
was mainly due to the decline in net income and the distribution of
dividends for the financial year 2010.  Taking into account the dividend
distribution from the prior year retained earnings and the net income
generated for the year,  the equity ratio remained stable at 38%. 

Provisions increase 8%
Provisions were up € 24 million to € 339 million at the end of 2011
(2010: € 315 million).  This increase is primarily attributable to
provisions for pensions and similar commitments,  which were up
€ 11 million,  and an increase of € 13 million in other provisions,  which
were mainly personnel-related.

Cash outflow reflects dividend distribution and reduction
in bank borrowings
adidas AG generated a positive cash flow from operating activities in
the amount of € 157 million compared to € 790 million in the prior
year.  The positive cash flow was primarily a result of the net income
of € 111 million generated during the period.  Net cash outflow from
investment activities was € 132 million (2010: € 108 million).  This is
largely attributable to capital expenditure for tangible and intangible
fixed assets of € 98 million.  Financing activities resulted in a negative
cash flow of € 323 million (2010: cash outflow of € 232 million).  The
cash outflow from financing activities relates to cash outflows for the
dividend payment of € 167 million and the reduction in bank borrowings
totalling € 156 million.  As a result of all these developments,  cash and
cash equivalents of adidas AG decreased € 299 million to € 383 million
at the end of December 2011 compared to € 682 million at the end of
December 2010.

Composition of subscribed capital
The nominal capital of adidas AG amounts to € 209216186 (as at
December 31,  2011) and is divided into the same number of registered
no-par-value shares with a pro-rata amount in the nominal capital of
€ 1 each ('shares").  As at December 31,  2011,  adidas AG does not
hold any treasury shares   see Note 25,  p.  198.  Pursuant to § 4 section 8
of the Articles of Association,  shareholders' claims to the issuance
of individual share certificates are in principle excluded.  Each share
grants one vote at the Annual General Meeting.  All shares carry the
same rights and obligations. 
In the USA,  we have issued American Depositary Receipts (ADRs). 
ADRs are deposit certificates of non-US shares that are traded instead
of the original shares on US stock exchanges.  Two ADRs equal one
share. 

Restrictions on voting rights or transfer of shares
adidas AG has a revolving credit line of € 1860 billion,  which was
unutilised as at the balance sheet date   see Treasury,  p.  129. 
adidas AG is able to meet its financial commitments at all times. 

We are not aware of any contractual agreements with adidas AG or
other agreements restricting voting rights or the transfer of shares. 
Based on the Code of Conduct of adidas AG,  however,  particular
lock-up periods do exist for members of the Executive Board with
regard to the purchase and sale of adidas AG shares.  These lock-up
periods are connected with the publication of quarterly and full year
results.  Such lock-up periods also exist for employees who have
access to yet unpublished financial results.  In addition,  restrictions of
voting rights pursuant,  inter alia,  to § 136 German Stock Corporation
Act (Aktiengesetz AktG) or for treasury shares pursuant to § 71b AktG
may exist. 

Shareholdings in share capital exceeding 10% of
voting rights
We have not been notified of,  and are not aware of,  any direct or
indirect shareholdings in the share capital of adidas AG exceeding 10%
of the voting rights. 

Shares with special rights
There are no shares bearing special rights,  in particular there are no
shares with rights conferring powers of control. 

Voting right control if employees have a share in
the capital
Like all other shareholders,  employees who hold adidas AG shares
exercise their control rights directly in accordance with statutory
provisions and the Articles of Association.

Executive Board appointment and dismissal

Authorisation of the Executive Board to issue shares 
Pursuant to § 6 of the Articles of Association and § 84 AktG,  the Supervisory Board is responsible for determining the number of members
of the Executive Board,  for their appointment and dismissal as well as
for the appointment of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO).  Currently,  the
adidas AG Executive Board comprises the CEO as well as three further
members   see Executive Board,  p.  34.  Executive Board members may be
appointed for a maximum period of five years.  Such appointments may
be renewed and the terms of office may be extended,  provided that no
term exceeds five years. 

The authorisations of the Executive Board are regulated by §§ 76
et seq.  AktG in conjunction with § 7 of the Articles of Association. 
The Executive Board is responsible,  in particular,  for managing the
company and represents the company judicially and extra-judicially. 

The Supervisory Board may revoke the appointment of an individual
as member of the Executive Board or CEO for good cause,  such as
gross negligence of duties or a vote of no confidence by the Annual
General Meeting.  As adidas AG is subject to the regulations of the
German Co-Determination Act (Mitbestimmungsgesetz MitbestG)the appointment of Executive Board members and also their dismissal
requires a majority of at least two thirds of the Supervisory Board
members (§ 31 MitbestG).  If such a majority is not established in the
first vote by the Supervisory Board,  upon proposal of the Mediation
Committee,  the appointment or dismissal may be made in a second
vote with a simple majority of the votes cast by the Supervisory Board
members.  Should the required majority not be established in this case
either,  a third vote,  again requiring a simple majority,  must be held in
which,  however,  the Chairman of the Supervisory Board has two votes. 
Furthermore,  the Fuerth local court shall,  pursuant to § 85 section 1
AktG,  in urgent cases,  make the necessary appointment upon application by any party involved,  if the Executive Board does not have the
required number of members. 

Amendments to the Articles of Association
Pursuant to § 179 section 1 sentence 1 AktG,  the Articles of Association of adidas AG can,  in principle,  only be amended by a resolution
passed by the Annual General Meeting.  Pursuant to § 21 section 3
of the Articles of Association in conjunction with § 179 section 2
sentence 2 AktG,  the Annual General Meeting of adidas AG principally
resolves upon amendments to the Articles of Association with a simple
majority of the votes cast and with a simple majority of the nominal
capital represented when passing the resolution.  If mandatory legal
provisions stipulate a larger majority of voting rights or capital,  this
is applicable.  When it comes to amendments solely relating to the
wording,  the Supervisory Board is,  however,  authorised to make these
modifications in accordance with § 179 section 1 sentence 2 AktG in
conjunction with § 10 section 1 of the Articles of Association. 

The authorisation of the Executive Board to issue shares is regulated
by § 4 of the Articles of Association and by statutory provisions:
Authorised Capital
– Until June 21,  2014,  the Executive Board is authorised to increase the
nominal capital,  subject to Supervisory Board approval,  by issuing
new shares against contributions in cash once or several times by

is authorised,  subject to Supervisory Board approval,  to also exclude
shareholders' subscription rights if the issue price of the bonds is
not significantly below the market value of these bonds and the

capital.  The issuance of new shares or the use of treasury shares
must be taken into account when calculating the limit of 10% in
certain specific cases.

032    Group Business Performance    Disclosures pursuant to § 315 Section 4 and § 289 Section 4 of the German Commercial Code 
– Until May 5,  2015,  the Executive Board is authorised to repurchase
adidas AG shares of up to an amount totalling 10% of the nominal
capital at the date of the resolution (or,  as the case may be,  a lower
amount of nominal capital at the date of utilisation of the authorisation)
for any lawful purpose and within the legal frame.  The authorisation
may be used by the company but also by its subsidiaries or by third
parties on account of the company or its subsidiaries or third parties
assigned by the company or one of its subsidiaries. 
The repurchase via the stock exchange will be carried out through
 public repurchase offer,  through a public invitation to submit sale
offers or through granting tender rights to shareholders.  Furthermorethe authorisation sets out the lowest and highest nominal value that
may be granted in each case. 
The purposes for which adidas AG shares repurchased based on this
authorisation may be used are set out in Item 11 of the Agenda for
the Annual General Meeting held on May 6,  2010.  The shares may in
particular be used as follows:
–  hey may be sold via the stock exchange,  through a public share

purchase offer made to all shareholders or sold otherwise against
cash (limited to 10% of the nominal capital taking into account
certain offsets) at a price not significantly below the stock market
price of shares with the same features. 
–  hey may be offered and assigned as consideration for the direct or

indirect acquisition of companies,  parts of companies or participations in companies or within the scope of company mergers. 
–  hey may be offered and sold as consideration for the acquisition

of industrial property rights or intangible property rights or for
the acquisition of licences relating to such rights,  also through
subsidiaries. 
–  hey may be used for purposes of meeting the subscription or

conversion rights or obligations or the company's right to delivery of
shares arising from bonds with warrants and/or convertible bonds. 
–  hey may be cancelled without the cancellation or the execution

thereof requiring an additional resolution of the Annual General
Meeting. 

The Supervisory Board may provide that transactions based on this
authorisation may only be carried out subject to the approval of the
Supervisory Board or one of its committees. 
– In the scope of the authorisation resolved by the Annual General
Meeting on May 6,  2010,  the Executive Board is furthermore
authorised to conduct the share buyback also by using equity derivatives which are arranged with a financial institution in close conformity
with market conditions.  adidas AG may acquire call options issued for
physical delivery and/or sell put options or use a combination of call
and put options or other equity derivatives if the option conditions
ensure that these shares are only delivered if they were purchased in
compliance with the equality principle.  All share purchases using the
aforementioned equity derivatives are limited to a maximum value of
5% of the nominal capital existing at the date on which the resolution
was adopted by the Annual General Meeting (or,  as the case may be,  a
lower amount of nominal capital at the date of utilisation of the authorisation).  The term of the options may not exceed 18 months and must
furthermore be chosen in such a way that the shares are acquired
upon the exercise of the options no later than May 5,  2015.  The authorisation furthermore sets out the lowest and highest nominal value that
may be granted in each case. 
For excluding subscription rights,  the use and cancellation of shares
purchased using equity derivatives,  the general provisions adopted by
the Annual General Meeting (set out above) are applicable accordingly. 

Change of control/compensation agreements
Material agreements entered into by adidas AG containing a changeof-control clause relate to financing agreements.  In the case of a
change of control,  these agreements,  in accordance with common
practice,  entitle the creditor to termination and early calling-in of any
outstanding amounts. 
No compensation agreements exist between adidas AG and members
of the Executive Board or employees relating to the event of a takeover
bid. 

Furthermore,  the shares may be assigned to members of the
Executive Board as compensation by way of a stock bonus subject to
the provision that resale by the Executive Board members shall only
be permitted following a retention period of at least three years from
the date of assignment.  Responsibility in this case lies with the Supervisory Board.

Business Performance by Segment
The adidas Group has divided its operating activities into Wholesale,  Retail and Other Businesses.  The
Wholesale segment comprises the adidas and Reebok business activities with retailers.  The Retail
segment comprises the own-retail and eCommerce activities of the adidas and Reebok brands.  The
financial results of TaylorMade-adidas Golf,  Rockport,  Reebok-CCM Hockey and Other Centrally Managed
Brands,  which comprise brands such as Y-3,  are aggregated under Other Businesses.

2011

In 2011,  sales in the Wholesale segment grew 11% on a currency-neutral
basis,  driven by double-digit growth at adidas Sport Performance and
­
adidas Sport Style.  Currency-neutral Reebok revenues increased at a
low-single-digit rate.  Currency translation effects negatively impacted
segmental revenues in euro terms.  Sales in the Wholesale segment
grew 10% to € 8971 billion from € 8181 billion in 2010   Table 01.

Wholesale gross margin decreased 13 percentage points to 400%
from 413% in 2010.  The positive impact from a more favourable
product and regional sales mix as well as less clearance sales was
more than offset by higher input costs.  By brand,  the adidas wholesale
gross margin declined 16 percentage points to 420% (2010: 437%). 
Wholesale gross margin of the Reebok brand decreased 11 percentage
points to 296% versus 307% in the prior year.  Wholesale gross profit
grew 6% to € 3585 billion from € 3379 billion in 2010   Table 01. 
Segmental operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased
03 percentage points to 96% (2010: 99%).  In euro terms,  segmental
operating expenses increased 7% to € 861 million from € 807 million
in 2010.  This was primarily due to higher warehousing and distribution
costs as a result of the Wholesale segment's expansion.  Segmental
operating expenses in Wholesale primarily relate to sales working
budget expenses as well as expenditure for sales force,  administration
and logistics.

Segmental operating profit improved 6% to € 2725 billion versus
€ 2572 billion in the prior year.  Segmental operating margin decreased
11 percentage points to 304% (2010: 314%)   Table 01,  as a result of
the gross margin decrease which more than offset the positive effect
of lower segmental operating expenses as a percentage of sales. 

Wholesale development by region
Currency-neutral sales for the Wholesale segment increased in all
regions in 2011.  Currency-neutral revenues in Western Europe rose
10%,  mainly driven by strong sales growth in all key markets with the
exception of the UK.  Currency-neutral sales in European Emerging
Markets were up 5%,  driven by sales increases in Turkey.  Currencyneutral Wholesale sales in North America grew 15% due to doubledigit growth in both the USA and Canada.  Revenues in Greater China
increased 24% on a currency-neutral basis.  Sales in Other Asian

terms.  adidas Sport Style sales grew 19% to € 1861 billion (2010:
€ 1559 billion). 
In 2011,  Reebok wholesale revenues increased 3% on a currencyneutral basis.  This was mainly the result of sales growth in the
training category due to the ZigTech and RealFlex platforms.  Currency
translation effects negatively impacted revenues in euro terms. 
Reebok sales remained virtually unchanged at € 1499 billion (2010:

In 2011,  currency-neutral Retail sales increased 20%.  Concept storefactory outlet and other retail format currency-neutral sales were
all up at double-digit rates versus the prior year.  Currency translation effects negatively impacted segmental revenues in euro terms. 
Sales grew 17% to € 2793 billion from € 2389 billion in the prior year

the prior year,  with increases in all store formats. 
Gross margin in the Retail segment increased 08 percentage points
to 626% from 618% in 2010.  This was mainly a result of a higher
proportion of concept store sales which achieve higher margins
in comparison to factory outlets and other retail formats.  Factory
outlet sales margins also grew year-over-year.  By brand,  the adidas
gross margin grew 03 percentage points to 636% (2010: 632%) and
Reebok's gross margin improved 30 percentage points to 578%
(2010: 548%).  Retail gross profit increased 18% to € 1749 billion from
€ 1476 billion in 2010   Table 08. 
Segmental operating expenses increased 13% to € 1156 billion from
€ 1024 billion in 2010.  This was a result of higher sales working
budget expenses and higher expenses related to the expansion of
the Group's store base,  particularly in emerging markets.  Segmental
operating expenses as a percentage of sales declined 15 percentage
points to 414% (2010: 429%),  as a result of operating leverage in the
segment.  Segmental operating expenses in Retail primarily relate to
personnel and rent expenses as well as the sales working budget.

Risk and Opportunity Report
The adidas Group continuously explores and develops opportunities to sustain earnings and drive
long-term increases in shareholder value.  We acknowledge that in our daily business we are exposed
to various risks and that it is necessary to take certain risks to maximise business opportunities.  Our
risk and opportunity management principles and system provide the framework for our Group to conduct
business in a well-controlled environment. 

In order to further increase efficiency and effectiveness of the Group's
risk management process,  we implemented a Group-wide IT solution
in 2011 which allows for systematic analysis and monitoring of risks
and opportunities.  This IT solution supports all Risk Owners (i, e.  all
direct reports to the adidas AG Executive Board and the managing
directors of all our markets) in managing risks and opportunities
and facilitates continuous documentation,  monitoring and evaluation
of risks and opportunities.  In addition,  we further refined the Group
Risk Management Policy which is available to all Group employees
on our intranet.  The policy outlines the principles,  processes,  toolsrisk areas,  key responsibilities,  reporting requirements and communication timelines within our Group.  In particular,  we decided to place
extra emphasis on more detailed assessment of risks and opportun­
ities in the upcoming twelve-month period while at the same time
maintaining transparency and awareness of risks and opportunities
that may affect the Group in the medium to long term.

The adidas Group is regularly confronted with risks and opportunities
which have the potential to negatively or positively impact the assetsliabilities,  financial position and profit and loss of the Group,  or intangible assets such as brand image. 

Risk and opportunity management system
We define risk as the potential occurrence of an external or internal
event (or series of events) that may negatively impact our ability to
achieve the Group's business objectives or financial goals.  Opportunity
is defined as the potential occurrence of an external or internal event
(or series of events) that can positively impact the Group's business
objectives or financial goals. 
We have summarised the most important of these risks and opportunities in this Risk and Opportunity Report in three main categories:
Strategic and Operational,  Compliance-related and Financial. 

The adidas AG Executive Board has the overall responsibility to
operate an effective risk and opportunity management system that
ensures comprehensive and consistent management of all significant
risks and opportunities.  The Group Risk Management department
coordinates the execution and further development of the adidas
Group's risk and opportunity management system and is the owner of
the centrally managed risk and opportunity management process on
behalf of the adidas AG Executive Board.  The adidas AG Supervisory
Board has the responsibility to monitor the effectiveness of the Group's
risk management system.  These duties are undertaken by the Supervisory Board's Audit Committee.  In addition,  wherever relevant,  our
Global Internal Audit department also includes an assessment of Risk
Owners' compliance with the Group Risk Management Policy within
the scope of their audit,  as part of their regular auditing activities.

To facilitate effective risk and opportunity management,  we have an
integrated risk and opportunity management system in place,  which
focuses on the identification,  evaluation,  handling,  monitoring and
reporting of risks and opportunities.  The key objective of this system is
to protect and further grow shareholder value through an opportunityfocused,  but risk-aware decision-making framework. 

20

We believe that a key component of optimal risk and opportunity
management is the identification and evaluation of risks,  riskmitigating actions and opportunities where they arise.  In addition,  a
concerted approach to handling,  monitoring and reporting is of key
importance.  Therefore,  risk and opportunity management is a Groupwide activity,  which utilises critical day-to-day management insight
from both global and local business units and functions. 
Our risk and opportunity management process contains the following
components:
– 
Risk and opportunity identification: The adidas Group continuously monitors the macroeconomic environment,  developments in
the sporting goods industry,  as well as internal processes to identify
risks and opportunities as early as possible.  The Risk Owners have
primary responsibility for the identification of risks and opportunities. 
The Group Risk Management department has defined a catalogue of
potential risks (Risk Universe) to assist Risk Owners in identifying
and categorising risks and opportunities.  Our broad network of Risk
Owners,  which includes senior managers across all functions and
markets,  ensures an effective identification of risks and opportunities. 
While various Risk Owners according to their area of responsibility actively monitor changes in the overall macroeconomic,  political and
social landscape,  others closely observe brand,  distribution channel
and price point developments as well as changes in other areas
such as input prices,  financial market conditions or technological
developments. 
The Risk Owners use various instruments in the risk and opportunity identification process such as primary qualitative and quantitative research including trend scouting,  consumer surveys as well as
feedback from our business partners and controlled space network. 
These efforts are supported by global market research and competitor
analysis.  Through this process,  we seek to identify the marketscategories,  consumer target groups and product styles which show
most potential for future growth at a local and global level.  Equallyour analysis focuses on those areas that are at risk of saturation,  or
exposed to increased competition or changing consumer tastes. 

– Risk and opportunity evaluation: In order to manage risks and opportunities in an effective way,  we evaluate identified risks and opportun­
ities individually according to a systematic evaluation methodologywhich is applied consistently and allows adequate prioritisation as
well as allocation of resources.  According to our risk and opportunity
management methodology,  a risk and opportunity score is calculated
by multiplying the potential financial impact in the upcoming twelvemonth period with the likelihood of occurrence.  The financial impact
represents the biggest possible potential effect on the relevant income
statement metrics (operating profit,  financial result or tax expenses). 
The financial impact is evaluated by utilising five categories: MarginalMinor,  Moderate,  Significant and Major.  Likelihood represents the
possibility that a given risk or opportunity may occur.  The likelihood of
individual risks and opportunities is evaluated on a percentage scale
divided into five categories: Unlikely,  Possible,  Likely,  Probable and
Highly Probable. 
In order to assess the potential financial impact for each individual
risk,  the gross risk score and the net risk score have to be evaluated. 
While the gross risk score reflects the worst-case negative financial
impact before any mitigating actions,  the net risk score reflects the
expected financial impact after all mitigating actions.  This approach
on the one hand allows for a good understanding of the impact of an
individual mitigating action taken,  and on the other hand provides the
basis for scenario analysis and simulations.  In addition,  the respective
Risk Owners are also required to assess each risk from a timing
perspective in order to determine when the risk could materialise. 
Whenever a risk materialises,  we measure the actual financial impact
against the original assessment.  In that way,  we ensure continuous
monitoring of the accuracy of risk evaluations across the Group. 
In assessing the potential effect on the relevant income statement
metric from opportunities,  each opportunity is appraised with respect
to viability,  commerciality and potential risks.  This approach is applied
to longer-term strategic prospects but also to shorter-term tactical
and opportunistic initiatives at both the Group and,  more extensivelythe market and brand level. 
– Risk and opportunity handling: Risks and opportunities are treated
in accordance with the Group's risk and opportunity management
principles as described in the Group Risk Management Policy.  Risk
Owners are in charge of developing and implementing appropriate
risk-mitigating actions and exploiting opportunities within their area
of responsibility.  In addition,  the Risk Owners need to determine a
general risk handling strategy for the identified risks,  which is either
risk avoidance,  risk reduction with the objective to minimise financial
impact and/or likelihood of occurrence,  risk transfer to a third party or
risk acceptance.  The decision on the implementation of the respective
risk handling strategy also takes into account the costs in relation to
the effectiveness of any planned mitigating actions if applicable.  Group
Risk Management works closely with the Risk Owners to monitor the
continuous progress of planned mitigating actions and assess the
viability of already implemented mitigating actions.

Material changes in previously reported risks and/or newly identified
risks with a potential net impact on the relevant income statement
metric of more than € 5 million,  and any issues identified which due
to their material nature require immediate reporting to the Executive
Board,  are also reported outside the regular quarterly reporting
stream on an ad-hoc basis. 

Description of the main features of the internal control
and risk management system relating to the financial
reporting process pursuant to § 315 section 2 no.  5
German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch HGB)
We regard the internal control and risk management system relating
to the consolidated financial reporting process of the adidas Group as
 system which is embedded within the Group-wide risk management
system.  The internal control and risk management system with respect
to the financial reporting process aims at avoiding false representation
in our Group accounting and in external financial reporting.  To this
end,  Group-wide compliance with statutory provisions and internal
Group regulations must be ensured.  We regard the internal control
and risk management system as a process based on the principle of
segregation of duties,  encompassing various sub-processes in the
areas of Accounting,  Controlling,  Taxes,  Treasury,  Planning,  Reporting
and Legal,  focusing on the identification,  assessment,  treatmentmonitoring and reporting of financial reporting risks.  Clearly defined
responsibilities are assigned to each distinct sub-process in the
various areas.  In a first step,  the internal control and risk management
system serves to identify and assess as well as to limit and control
risks identified in the consolidated accounting process which might
result in our consolidated financial statements not being in conformity
with regulations. 

adidas AG defines uniform consolidated accounting policies and
updates these on a regular basis,  dependent on regulatory changes
and internal developments.  Clear regulations serve to limit employees'
scope of discretion with regard to inclusion and valuation of assets and
liabilities,  thus reducing the risk of inconsistent accounting practices
within the Group.  These policies are available to all employees involved
in the financial accounting process through the Group-wide intranet. 
Material changes are communicated to the subsidiaries Group-wide
on a quarterly basis.  We aim to ensure compliance with the financial
accounting rules through continuous adherence to the four-eyes
principle in accounting-related processes.  Certain reporting obligations and the extent thereof are mandatory for the Group's subsid­
iaries.  Adherence to reporting obligations and timelines is monitored
centrally by Group Accounting. 
Financial accounting at subsidiaries is conducted either locally by
the respective company or by a Shared Service Centre that provides
this service for several subsidiaries.  Most of the IT systems used
are based on SAP AFS.  Some Group companies use Navision-based
ERP software that was developed in-house.  The individual financial
statements are subsequently transferred into a central consolidation
system based on SAP SEM-BCS.  The regularity and reliability of the
financial statements prepared by subsidiaries is reviewed at Group
level by Group Accounting and Controlling.  If necessary,  the Group
seeks the opinion of independent experts to review business transactions that occur infrequently and cannot be processed as a matter
of routine.  Controls within the consolidation process such as those
relating to the consolidation of liabilities or of revenues and expenses
are conducted both automatically (system-based) and manually.  Any
inadequacies are remedied and reported back to the subsidiaries. 
All financial systems used are protected against malpractice by
means of appropriate authorisation concepts and access restrictions. 
Access authorisations are reviewed on a regular basis and updated
if required.  The risk of data loss or outage of financial-accountingrelated IT systems is minimised by Group IT through central control
and monitoring of virtually all IT systems,  centralised management
of change processes and with support through regular data backups.

Regular risk reporting consists of a two-step reporting stream.  Firstlyon a quarterly basis,  Risk Owners are required to report to Group Risk
Management gross risks with a possible impact on the relevant income
statement metric above the threshold of € 50 million regardless of
their likelihood of materialising and net risks with an expected value
(i, e.  potential impact on the relevant metric in euros multiplied with
likelihood of materialising) of over € 1 million.  Opportunities are
aggregated separately with Risk Owners reporting all opportunities
with an opportunity value of above € 1 million on the relevant metric. 
Secondly,  Group Risk Management aggregates the reported risks andalso on a quarterly basis,  provides the adidas AG Executive Board with
 consolidated Group-wide report based on the Risk Owners' input. 

The internal control system relating to the financial accounting process
serves to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements
are prepared in compliance with regulations despite identified
financial reporting risks.  To ensure the effectiveness of the internal
control and risk management system,  the Internal Audit department
regularly reviews accounting-relevant processes.  Additionally,  as part
of the year-end audit,  the external auditor examines selected internal
controls of the system,  including the IT systems,  to assess their
effectiveness.  Even with appropriate and functional systems,  howeverabsolute certainty cannot be guaranteed.

– 
Risk and opportunity monitoring and reporting: Our integrated
risk and opportunity management system aims to increase the transparency of Group risks and opportunities.  As both risks and opportun­
ities are subject to constant change,  Risk Owners not only monitor
developments,  but also the adequacy and effectiveness of the current
risk handling strategy on an ongoing basis.

Macroeconomic risks
Growth in the sporting goods industry is highly dependent on
consumer spending and consumer confidence.  Economic downturnssocio-political factors such as civil unrest,  nationalisation or expropriation,  in particular in regions where the Group is highly representedtherefore pose a significant risk to sales development.  To mitigate
this risk,  the Group strives to balance sales across key global regions
and also between developed and emerging markets.  In addition,  we
continuously monitor the macroeconomic and political landscape in
all our key markets to anticipate potential problem areas,  so that we
are able to quickly adjust our business activities accordingly upon any
change in conditions.

Industry consolidation and competition risks 
To moderate this risk,  we are also committed to maintaining a regionally
balanced sales mix and adapting the Group's distribution strategy
with a particular focus on controlled space initiatives   see Global Sales
Strategy,  p.  62.  In addition,  we are constantly investing in strengthening
brand equity to increase the attractiveness and consumer appeal of
our products   see Global brands Strategy,  p.  68.  Furthermore,  we expect
merger and acquisition activity within the sporting goods industry to
remain buoyant given robust corporate balance sheets and business
projections.  Although we expect competition in our industry to remain
intense,  we now regard risks from industry consolidation and competition as likely.  The potential financial impact is assessed as major. 

Failure to anticipate and respond to changes in consumer demand
for sporting goods products is one of the most serious threats to our
industry.  Consumer demand changes can be sudden and unexpectedparticularly in our fashion-related businesses.  Because industry
product procurement cycles average 12 to 18 months,  the Group
faces a risk of short-term revenue loss in cases where it is unable to
respond quickly to such changes.  Even more critical,  however,  is the
risk of continuously overlooking a new consumer trend or failing to
acknowledge its potential magnitude over a sustained period of time. 
To mitigate these risks,  identifying and responding to shifts in
consumer demand as early as possible is a key responsibility of our
brands and,  in particular,  of the respective Risk Owners.  Thereforewe utilise extensive primary and secondary research tools as outlined
in our risk and opportunity identification process. 
As a leader in our industry,  our brand strategies are focused on influencing rather than reacting to the changing consumer environment. 
We invest significant resources in research and develop­ ent to

innovate and bring fresh new technologies and designs to market 
 see Research and Development,  p.  95. 
We also seek to enhance consumer demand for our brands through
extensive marketing,  product and brand communication programmes 
 see Global brands Strategy,  p.  68.  And we focus on supply chain improvements to shorten production lead times   see Global Operations,  p.  90. 
Given the broad spectrum of our Group's product offering,  feedback
from retailers,  consumers and athletes as well as evidence from
our own-retail stores and other early indicators   see Internal Group
Management System,  p.  114,  we view the risk from consumer demand shifts
as unchanged versus the prior year.  We therefore rate the likelihood
of changes in consumer demand as likely,  and the potential financial
impact as moderate. 

Hazard risks
The adidas Group is exposed to external risks such as natural
disasters,  epidemics,  fire,  accidents and malicious acts.  Physical
damage to our own or our suppliers' premises,  production unitswarehouses and stock in transit can lead to property damage and
business interruption. 
These risks are mitigated by loss prevention measures such as
working with reliable suppliers and logistics providers who guarantee
high safety standards.  In addition to the insurance coverage we
have secured,  the Group has also implemented contingency plans
and preventative measures (e.g.  sprinklers in facilities) to minimise
potential negative effects. 
As a result of the increasing frequency of natural disasters (e.g.  earthquakes,  floods,  etc. ) around the world,  we now assess the potential
occurrence of hazard risks as possible.  Should those risks materialise,  the potential financial impact could be major,  reflecting the
fundamental and devastating consequences natural disasters or
terrorist acts might have on our business. 

  adidas Group 
2011 Annual Report 
149

Consumer demand risks 
The adidas Group is exposed to risks from market consolidation and
strategic alliances amongst competitors and/or retailers,  intense
competition for consumers from both well-established industry peers
and new market entrants (e.g.  new brands,  vertical retailers) as well
as the expansion of retailers' own private label businesses.  This can
result in a reduction of our bargaining power,  or harmful competitive
behaviour such as price wars.  Abnormal product discounting and
reduced shelf space allocation from retailers are the most common
potential outcomes of these risks.  Sustained promotional pressure in
one of the Group's key markets could threaten the Group's sales and
profitability development. 

20

Furthermore,  a core element of our positioning in performance
sports is the utilisation of an extensive global event and partnership
portfolio where demand is more predictable and less sensitive to
macroeconomic influences.  In 2012,  we expect the global economy
to grow,  albeit with varying degrees of performance geographically 
 see Subsequent Events and Outlook,  p.  163.  As a result,  we continue to assess
the likelihood that adverse macroeconomic events could impact our
business as likely.  However,  as a result of the highly challenging
macroeconomic environment in many European countries,  Japan and
the USA,  we regard the potential financial impact of macroeconomic
and socio-political factors as major,  which represents an increase
compared to the prior year evaluation.

Reputation/brand image risks 
20

11

150

The adidas Group faces considerable risk if we are unable to uphold
high levels of consumer awareness,  affiliation and purchase intent
for our brands.  Negative media coverage on our products or business
practices,  unfavourable stakeholder activism and speed and influence
of social media discussion may significantly hurt the Group's reputation
and brand image and eventually lead to a sales slowdown.  In additionif the Group's brands are not allocating sufficient marketing resources
to activate our sports assets and brand campaigns in a sustainable
manner,  we face the risk of fading consumer awareness and brand
attractiveness.  To mitigate these risks,  we pursue pro-active,  open
communication with key stakeholders (e.g.  consumers,  medianon-governmental organisations,  financial community,  etc. ) on a
continuous basis.  We have also defined clear mission statementsvalues and goals for all our brands   see Global brands Strategy,  p.  68    see
Other businesses strategy,  p.  82.  These form the foundation of our product
and brand communication strategies.  Furthermore,  we continue to
invest significant marketing resources to build brand momentum and
foster consumer awareness. 
We continue to believe that a considerable deterioration in the Group's
reputation and the image of our brands could have a significant
financial impact on our Group.  As a result of ever-increasing media
and other stakeholder activities worldwide,  coupled with the fastmoving and hardly controllable nature of social media,  we consider
reputation and brand image risks more likely to materialise and have
therefore increased the likelihood of occurrence to probable. 

Our increased focus on improving our sophistication as a retailer
by investing in management expertise as well as in IT systems
remains a key priority for 2012   see Global Sales Strategy,  p.  62.  Nevertheless,  we continue to view the risk of underperformance of some
of our own-retail stores as likely.  The potential financial impact from
own-retail underperformance,  which may also involve impairment
charges and store closures,  is moderate. 

Risks related to rising input costs
Raw material and labour costs account for approximately 70% of the
Group's cost of sales.  Prices of materials such as rubber,  cottonpolyester and those which closely correlate with the oil price are
especially subject to the risk of price changes.  As our ordering process
and price negotiations usually take place around six months in advance
of production,  our sourcing function has visibility and reaction time to
reflect sharp increases in input costs in its planning. 
To reduce the financial impact on our product margins from higher
sourcing costs,  we are implementing further lean manufacturing
techniques at our partner factories,  reducing time and cost in the
procurement process,  re-engineering our products and selectively increasing prices where possible.  In addition,  the Profitability
Management department within the Global Operations function is
mandated with driving strategic initiatives to ensure competitiveness
of our supply chain in light of increasing input costs   see Global
­Operations,  p.  90.  In the medium term,  we also have the ability to adapt
our sourcing structure to take advantage of more competitive pricing
in other locations. 

Own-retail risks
New adidas,  Reebok and Rockport own-retail stores require considerable up-front investment in furniture and fixtures as well as ongoing
maintenance.  In addition,  own-retail activities often require longerterm lease or rent commitments.  Retail also employs significantly
more personnel in relation to sales than our wholesale business.  The
higher portion of fixed costs compared to our wholesale business
implies a larger profitability impact in cases of significant sales
declines.  Delayed openings or poorly executed store operations
could lead to sales shortfalls and also negatively affect brand image. 
Further,  inability to secure appropriate store locations may result in
worse than expected sales development. 
The Group reduces this risk by only entering into lease contracts
with durations of less than ten years.  Store openings are managed
according to a standardised Group-wide business plan model.  Store
performance is measured by a retail scorecard consisting of nine
quantitative key performance indicators.  Underperforming stores are
reorganised,  remodelled or closed as appropriate. 

As a result of the high degree of volatility on global commodity
markets in 2011 as well as currently increasing labour costs,  we do
not forecast any positive impact on our sourcing costs in 2012.  As we
begin planning for 2013,  increases in sourcing costs cannot be ruled
out.  Therefore,  we continue to assess the risks related to rising input
costs as having a highly probable likelihood of occurrence and a major
potential financial impact. 

Supplier risks
Almost the entire adidas Group product offering is sourced through
independent suppliers,  mainly located in Asia   see Global ­Operations,  p.  90. 
To reduce the risk of business interruptions following the potential
underperformance of a supplier,  the relocation of a supplier's
production sites or a potential supplier default,  we work with vendors
who demonstrate reliability,  quality,  innovation and continuous
improvement.

  Group M a n a gemen t Report Fin a nci a l Re v ie w 
034    Risk and Opportunity Report    Strategic and operational risks 
To limit these risks,  we utilise a broad distribution strategy which
includes further expanding our controlled space activities.  This
enables us to reduce negative consequences resulting from sales
shortfalls that can occur with key customers.  Specifically,  no single
customer of our Group accounted for more than 10% of Group sales
in 2011. 
In addition,  building strong relationships with retailers to become a
valuable and reliable business partner for them is one of the guiding
principles of our Wholesale segment   see Wholesale Strategy,  p.  63.  By
differentiating our product offering to customers,  we limit the risk of
increased price competition on specific products. 

As a result,  we assess supplier risks as having a possible likelihood of
occurrence and a major potential financial impact. 

Inventory risks
As we place initial production orders around six months in advance
of delivery,  the adidas Group is exposed to inventory risks relating
to misjudging consumer demand at the time of production planning. 
 sudden decline in demand has the potential to cause excess
inventories.  This can have negative implications for our financial
perform­
ance,  including higher levels of clearance activity and
inventory obsolescence as well as reduced liquidity due to higher
operating working capital requirements. 

Furthermore,  with our substantial marketing efforts we are aiming
at building desirable brands which resonate with the tastes of our
consumers and ultimately drive high sell-through rates for our
customers. 
Given our strong partnerships with key retailers,  we now view the
likelihood of occurrence for customer risks as likely.  The potential
financial impact on the Group is regarded as major. 

Regulatory risks
Similarly,  a sudden increase in demand can lead to product shortfalls
at the point of sale.  In this situation,  our Group faces the risk of missed
sales opportunities and/or customer and consumer disappointmentwhich could lead to a reduction in brand loyalty and our reputation
as an on-time,  in-full supplier.  In addition,  the Group faces potential
profitability impacts from costs such as air freight in efforts to speed
up replenishment. 
In order to mitigate these risks,  we continuously strive to improve our
forecasting and material planning processes.  To that end,  in 2011we began to introduce an enhanced forecasting approach around
full integration of key business functions globally   see Internal group
management system,  p.  114.  In addition,  our Global Operations function offers
sophisticated and tailored replenishment models in order to shorten
order-to-delivery times,  ensuring availability of products while
avoiding excess inventories   see Global ­Operations,  p.  90. 
Nevertheless,  the expected over-proportionate growth of the Retail
segment will increase the exposure towards swings in consumer
demand,  and also makes the Group more susceptible to the risk of
inventory shrinkage or excess inventory.  As a result,  we now assess
inventory risks to have a probable likelihood and a moderate potential
financial impact on our Group. 

Regulatory risks predominantly include potential losses from significant changes to trade policies.  In particular,  the adidas Group faces
risks arising from sudden increases of import restrictions,  as well
as import tariffs and duties that could compromise the free flow of
goods within the Group and from suppliers.  For example,  several
Latin American countries have significant import duties in place on
footwear imports from China,  which negatively impacts our profit­
ability in these markets. 
To limit these risks,  we proactively utilise a regionally diversified
supplier base,  which provides some protection against unforeseen
changes in regulations and also allows us to shift production to other
countries at an early stage if necessary   see Global Operations,  p.  90. 
Furthermore,  building on our leading position within the sporting
goods industry,  we actively engage in supporting policymakers to
liberalise global trade and curtail trade barriers. 
As a result of the likelihood of rising protectionist activity by governments,  we continue to regard further political and regulatory actions
as having a likely potential of occurrence.  An unexpected material
change in the political and regulatory environment could have a
signifi­ ant financial impact on the Group. 
 
Customer risks
Customer risks arise from our dependence on key customers who
have the ability to exert bargaining power and can therefore cause
considerable margin pressure or cancel orders.  These risks exist
not only due to the relative size of some of our major customers,  but
also as a result of our limited ability to influence how they conduct
business. 

  adidas Group

In addition,  we have bought insurance coverage for the risk of business
interruptions caused by physical damage to supplier premises. 

20

Furthermore,  in order to minimise any potential negative consequences such as product quality shortfalls,  increased product lead
times or violation of our Workplace Standards,  we enforce strict
control and inspection procedures at our suppliers and also demand
adherence to social and environmental standards throughout our
supply chain   see Sustainability,  p.  107.

Risks related to key event or promotion partnerships 
20

11

152

Event and promotion partnerships play an important role in building
brand image and product authenticity with our consumers,  and this
ultimately supports the generation of sales   see Global brands Strategyp.  68    see other businesses strategy,  p.  82.  The adidas Group faces the risk of
either losing key partnerships or having to accept unfavourable terms
due to intensified competition for attractive contracts.  To mitigate
these inherent risks,  we not only seek to extend our most important
partnership agreements before contract expiry,  but also to broaden
the Group's portfolio of premium partnerships to help our brands
expand their consumer reach and reduce our reliance on single affiliations.  Two examples in 2011 were the extension of the partnership
between adidas and the Spanish Football Federation and Reebok's
alliance with Swizz Beatz to lead the creative direction of the relaunch
of Reebok's Classics business. 
We also regularly include change-of-control clauses as well as
non-cash compensation components in contracts to avoid the risk
that negotiations are reduced solely to price.  We expect a high level of
competition for top promotion partnerships to continue in the near to
medium term as smaller competitors are expected to intensify their
spending in this area. 
We also face the risk of misconduct or misbehaviour by our assets
on the one hand and unsatisfying on-field performance of athletes
on the other hand.  Therefore,  our sports marketing contracts include
clauses which protect us in case of fraudulent,  criminal or immoral
behaviour by athletes.  We have also secured insurance coverage in
case of athletes' injuries.  In addition,  a sophisticated scouting system
enables us to identify the most attractive and relevant sponsorship
assets. 

We continue to assess the likelihood of occurrence of risks from
product innovation and development as possible.  Given the broad
spectrum of the adidas Group's product offering,  on an aggregate
level,  we continue to rate the potential financial impact as minor. 

Personnel risks
Achieving the adidas Group's goal of becoming the global leader in
the sporting goods industry is highly dependent on our employees
and their talents.  The loss of key personnel in strategic positions is
therefore an obvious risk we face.  We also face the risk of being unable
to identify,  recruit and retain the most talented people who best meet
the specific needs of our Group.  In addition,  a lack of sufficient training
measures might cause the dilution of critical knowledge,  in particular
within the product design and development area. 
To reduce this risk,  we strongly engage in developing a motivating
working environment.  Our goal is to make the adidas Group the
'employer of choice" within our industry.  Attractive reward and
incentive schemes are designed to further support long-term career
opportunities and planning   see Employees,  p.  101. 
With the expansion of our own-retail activities and the increase of
our employee base in emerging markets,  we believe that employee
turnover will slightly increase in the future.  Moreover,  labour markets
are becoming increasingly more competitive,  with the battle for the
most talented employees constantly intensifying. 
Therefore,  we continue to assess the likelihood of occurrence of
personnel risks as likely.  If they materialise,  these risks could have a
moderate financial impact on our Group. 

IT risks
Given the maturity profile of our most important promotion contracts
and the vast portfolio of partnerships,  we believe the overall risk
related to key event or promotion partnerships is possible.  We assess
the potential financial impact of this risk to be significant in the
medium term. 

Product innovation and development risks
Innovative and attractive products generate strong sales and,  more
importantly,  create a halo effect for other products.  Furthermorefulfilling highest standards in terms of product quality and safety is
critical to sustainable commercial success and forms an integral part
of the product design and development phase.  The speed with which
new product technologies and fresh designs are brought to market
is decisive for maintaining competitive advantage.  In 2011,  all brands
generated the majority of their sales with products which had been
brought to market over the previous 12 to 18 months   see Research
and Development,  p.  95.  If the adidas Group failed to maintain a pipeline of
new innovative products over a sustained period of time,  we would
risk a significant sales decline.  We are committed to pursuing our
innovation and design strength.  To ensure we can quickly adapt to
changing consumer preferences,  we focus on streamlining research
and development processes to speed up the time to market. 

Key business processes including product marketing,  order
management,  warehouse management,  invoice processing,  customer
support and financial reporting are all dependent on IT systems. 
 significant systems outage or loss of data could result in considerable disruptions to our business.  Insufficient project management
could delay the execution of projects critical to the Group or make
them more expensive than planned.  Virus or malware attacks could
also lead to systems disruption and may result in the loss of businesscritical and/or confidential information.

  Group M a n a gemen t Report Fin a nci a l Re v ie w 
034    Risk and Opportunity Report    Strategic and operational risks    Compliance-related risks 
IT project risks are further mitigated by utilising a proven project
methodology for all IT projects that includes tight cost control and
regular risk reviews for all major projects.  The IT organisation's
strategic direction and five-year plan is aligned with the adidas
Group's overall Route 2015 strategic business plan.  New quality
reviews for major projects have been implemented to ensure that the
progress,  quality and costs of those projects are regularly evaluated by
members of senior management. 
As a result of an increased frequency of IT-related criminal activities
worldwide,  we now believe the risk of a major IT default is possible. 
Such a default could result in a significant potential financial impact. 

Compliance-related risks
Legal risks
As a global player,  the adidas Group is exposed to various legal risks
including contractual risks,  liability risks related to non-contractual
subject matters (e.g.  advertising claims) or the risk of claims and
litigation for infringement of third-party trademarks,  patents and
other rights.  To avoid contract breaches and prevent the Group from
entering into unfavourable contractual agreements,  we continually
monitor the fulfilment of our contractual obligations and constantly
involve internal and external legal experts in all contractual matters. 
In addition,  to reduce the risk of infringing third-party intellectual
property rights,  we carefully research new product technologiesdesigns and names to identify and avoid potential conflicts with the
rights of third parties.  We have further strengthened our Intellectual
Property department resources to drive enhancements in our patent
portfolio,  and in the reviewing and analysis of third-party patents. 

Social and environmental risks 
In the event of non-compliance with these standards,  we develop
joint action plans and set deadlines for compliance and further
improvement.  If these deadlines are not met,  business relations are
terminated   see Sustainability,  p.  107. 
In order to minimise the environmental impact of producing and
distributing our products,  the adidas Group developed a fully comprehensive environmental strategy (Environmental Strategy 2015).  This
strategy takes a holistic approach towards environmental issues such
as sustainable resource use,  climate change mitigation,  emissions to
water and air,  waste treatment as well as hazardous substances.  Part
of this strategy is also to extend our 'Better Place" initiative to more
adidas athletic footwear and apparel products   see Sustainability,  p.  107. 
Although we believe that social and environmental malpractice may
occur only in isolated cases,  we see increasing corporate social
responsibility obligations for the Group as legislative measures and
consumer expectations with regard to socially and environmentally sound business practices and behaviour are becoming more
demanding.  Due to this development we will,  for example,  have to
cope with rising costs in order to fulfil more challenging environmental requirements.  However,  as a consequence of the strategic
initiatives we are putting in place,  the likelihood of occurrence and
the potential financial impact from social and environmental risks are
now assessed as likely and moderate,  respectively. 

Despite the safeguarding measures in place,  we now assess the
likelihood of legal risks as likely.  If legal risks materialise,  the financial
impact for our Group could be significant. 

  adidas Group 
2011 Annual Report

We have a continuing responsibility to our employees,  suppliers and
the environment.  Malpractice in these areas,  in particular human
rights violations,  dubious employment practices as well as environmentally harmful production processes can have a significant impact
on the reputation and operational efficiency of our Group and our
suppliers.  To limit this risk,  we have established Workplace Standards
to which suppliers must conform before and during business relationships with the Group   see Sustainability,  p.  107.  Internal inspections
of supplier factories verified by extensive independent audits are
conducted regularly. 

20

To mitigate these risks,  our IT organisation proactively engages in
system preventive maintenance,  service continuity planning and
adherence to applicable IT policies.  Data security is managed by
restricting user access based on job description and adhering to
data protection regulations.  Additional security measures such as
anti-virus software and firewalls are designed to further protect
our systems and critical information.  We perform multiple backups
at alternating data centre locations for the Group's core enterprise
resource planning system (ERP) on a daily basis.  In addition,  for the
ERP system,  our contingency solution allows us to quickly switch to a
remote site if necessary without any loss of data.  System securitycontrols and reliability are reviewed and tested by the Internal Audit
department.

Risks related to product counterfeiting and imitation 
20

11

154

Risks related to non-compliance 
As popular consumer brands which rely on technological and design
innovation as defining characteristics,  the Group's brands are
frequent targets for counterfeiting and imitation.  To reduce the loss
of sales and the potential damage to brand reputation resulting from
counterfeit products,  the adidas Group makes use of extensive legal
protection (generally through registration) and works closely with law
enforcement authorities,  investigators and external legal counsel. 
Although we have stepped up measures such as product security
labelling with our authorised suppliers,  the development of these
measures remains a key priority on an ongoing basis.  In 2011,  around
12 million counterfeit adidas Group products were seized worldwide. 

We face the risk that our employees breach rules and standards that
guide appropriate and responsible business behaviour.  This includes
the risks of fraud and corruption.  In order to successfully manage
these risks,  the Group Policy Manual was launched at the end of 2006
to provide a framework for basic work procedures and processes.  It
also includes a Code of Conduct which stipulates that every employee
shall act ethically in compliance with the laws and regulations of
the legal systems where they conduct Group business.  All of our
employees have to participate in a special Code of Conduct training
as part of our Global Compliance Programme.  Various mechanisms
are in place to monitor compliance.  Whenever reasonable,  we actively
investigate and,  in case of unlawful conduct,  we work with state
authorities to ensure rigorous enforcement of criminal law. 

As a result of our relentless and intensive efforts against counterfeiting,  we believe the risks related to counterfeiting and imitation
have decreased,  and we now regard the likelihood of occurrence
as probable.  However,  we continue to assess the potential financial
impact related to counterfeiting and imitation as moderate. 

Product quality risks
The adidas Group faces a risk of selling defective products,  which may
result in injury to consumers and/or image impairment.  We mitigate
this risk by employing dedicated teams that monitor the quality of our
products on all levels of the supply chain through rigorous testing
prior to production,  close cooperation with suppliers throughout the
manufacturing process,  random testing after retail delivery,  open
communication about defective products and quick settlement of
product liability claims when necessary.  In 2011,  we did not recall any
products. 
As product quality requirements are becoming increasingly stringentwe believe the likelihood of occurrence of significant product liability
cases or having to conduct wide-scale product recalls has increased
to likely.  However,  we continue to assess the potential financial impact
as moderate. 

As a result of the substantial growth of our global workforce in recent
years,  we believe that both the impact and likelihood of occurrence of
risks related to non-compliance have increased.  We now regard the
likelihood of risks related to non-compliance as possible.  In case they
should materialise,  risks from non-compliance could have a moderate
financial impact. 

Financial risks
Credit risks
 credit risk arises if a customer or other counterparty to a financial
instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.  The adidas Group
is exposed to credit risks from its operating activities and from certain
financing activities.  Credit risks arise principally from accounts
receivable and,  to a lesser extent,  from other third-party contractual
financial obligations such as other financial assets,  short-term bank
deposits and derivative financial instruments   see Note 28,  p.  202.  Without
taking into account any collateral,  the carrying amount of financial
assets and accounts receivable represents the maximum exposure to
credit risk. 
At the end of 2011,  there was no relevant concentration of credit risk
by type of customer or geography.  Our credit risk exposure is mainly
influenced by individual customer characteristics.  Under the Group's
credit policy,  new customers are analysed for creditworthiness before
standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered. 
Tolerance limits for accounts receivable are also established for
each customer.  Both creditworthiness and accounts receivable limits
are monitored on an ongoing basis.  Customers that fail to meet the
Group's minimum creditworthiness are in general allowed to purchase
products only on a prepayment basis. 

  adidas Group 
2011 Annual Report 
  Group M a n a gemen t Report Fin a nci a l Re v ie w 
034    Risk and Opportunity Report    Financial risks 
Allowance accounts are used as long as the Group is satisfied that
recovery of the amount due is possible.  Once this is no longer the
case,  the amounts are considered irrecoverable and are directly
written off against the financial asset.  The allowance consists of two
components:
(1) n allowance established for all receivables dependent on the

ageing structure of receivables past due date and
(2)  specific allowance that relates to individually assessed risk for

each specific customer irrespective of ageing. 
At the end of 2011,  no Group customer accounted for more than 10% of
accounts receivable.  We therefore believe that the potential financial
impact of our credit risks from customers,  particularly smaller
retailers,  is moderate and we rate the likelihood of occurrence as
possible. 
The adidas Group Treasury department arranges currency and
interest rate hedges,  and invests cash,  with major banks of a high
credit standing throughout the world.  adidas Group companies are
authorised to work with banks rated BBB+ or higher.  Only in exceptional cases are subsidiaries authorised to work with banks rated
lower than BBB+.  To limit risk in these cases,  restrictions are clearly
stipulated,  such as maximum cash deposit levels.  In addition,  the
credit default swap premiums of our partner banks are monitored on
 weekly basis.  In the event that the defined threshold is exceededcredit balances are shifted to banks compliant with the limit. 

Financing and liquidity risks
Liquidity risks arise from not having the necessary resources available
to meet maturing liabilities with regard to timing,  volume and currency
structure.  In addition,  the adidas Group faces the risk of having to
accept unfavourable financing terms due to liquidity restraints.  Our
Group Treasury department uses an efficient cash management
system to manage liquidity risk.  At December 31,  2011,  Group cash
and cash equivalents amounted to € 906 million (2010: € 1156 billion). 
Moreover,  our Group maintains € 2164 billion bilateral short-term
credit lines and a € 1860 billion committed short-term syndicated
loan facility with international banks,  which does not include a market
disruption clause.  The € 4024 billion in credit lines are designed to
ensure sufficient liquidity at all times   see Treasury,  p.  129. 
Future cash outflows arising from financial liabilities that are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position are
presented in the following table   Table 04. 
This includes payments to settle obligations from borrowings as well
as cash outflows from cash-settled derivatives with negative market
values.  Financial liabilities that may be settled in advance without
penalty are included on the basis of the earliest date of potential
repayment.  Cash flows for variable-interest liabilities are determined
with reference to the conditions at the balance sheet date. 
In 2011,  we continued to improve our financial position substantially as we ended the year with net cash of € 90 million (2010: net
borrowings of € 221 million).  Thus the ratio of net borrowings over
EBITDA improved to 01 times at year-end,  which is well in line with
the Group's medium-term guideline of less than two times.  In the light
of our available credit lines,  financing structure and business modelwe assess the likelihood of occurrence of financing and liquidity risks
as unlikely,  and therefore expect only a minor potential financial
impact on the Group. 

As financial market conditions remain challenging and highly volatileour assessment of credit risks from these assets is unchanged.  We
continue to believe that the potential financial impact is moderate
and the likelihood of occurrence is possible.  Nevertheless,  we believe
our risk concentration is limited due to the broad distribution of our
investment business with more than 20 banks.  At December 31,  2011no bank accounted for more than 9% of our investments and the
average concentration,  including subsidiaries' short-term deposits in
local banks,  was 1%.  This leads to a maximum exposure of € 97 million
in the event of default of any single bank.  We have further diversified
our investment exposure by investing into AAA-rated money market
funds. 

  adidas Group 
2011 Annual Report

Objective evidence that financial assets are impaired includes,  for
instance,  significant financial difficulty of the issuer or debtor,  indications of the potential bankruptcy of the borrower and the disappearance of an active market for a financial asset because of financial
difficulties.  The Group utilises allowance accounts for impairments
that represent our estimate of incurred credit losses with respect to
accounts receivable. 

In addition,  we held derivatives with a positive fair market value in the
amount of € 181 million.  The maximum exposure to any single bank
resulting from these assets amounted to € 28 million and the average
concentration was 4%. 

20

Other activities to mitigate credit risks include retention of title
clauses as well as,  on a selective basis,  credit insurances,  accounts
receivable sales without recourse and bank guarantees.

Currency risks
Currency risks for the adidas Group are a direct result of multicurrency cash flows within the Group.  Furthermore,  translation
impacts from the conversion of non-euro-denominated results into
our Group's functional currency,  the euro,  might lead to a material
negative impact on our Group's financial performance.  The biggest
single driver behind this risk results from the mismatch of the
currencies required for sourcing our products versus the denominations of our sales.  The vast majority of our sourcing expenses are in
US dollars while sales are denominated in other currencies to a large
extent most notably the euro.  Our main exposures are presented
in the adjacent table   Table 05.  The exposure from firm commitments
and forecasted transactions was calculated on a one-year basis. 
In line with IFRS 7 requirements,  we have estimated the impact on
net income and shareholders' equity based on changes in our most
important currency exchange rates.  The calculated impacts mainly
result from fair value changes of our hedging instruments.  The
analysis does not include effects that arise from the translation of
our foreign entities' financial statements into the Group's reporting
currency,  the euro.  The sensitivity analysis is based on the net balance
sheet exposure,  including intercompany balances from monetary
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.  Moreover,  all
outstanding currency derivatives were re-evaluated using hypothetical
foreign exchange rates to determine the effects on net income and
equity.  The analysis was performed on the same basis for both 2010
and 2011. 

Based on this analysis,  a 10% increase in the euro versus the US dollar
at December 31,  2011 would have led to a € 5 million increase in net
income.  The more negative market values of the US dollar hedges
would have decreased shareholders' equity by € 195 million.  A 10%
weaker euro at December 31,  2011 would have led to a € 6 million
decrease in net income.  Shareholders' equity would have increased
by € 243 million   Table 06.  The impacts of fluctuations of the US dollar
against the Russian rouble and of the euro against the British pound
and the Japanese yen on net income and shareholders' equity are also
included in accordance with IFRS requirements. 
However,  many other financial and operational variables that could
potentially reduce the effect of currency fluctuations are excluded
from the analysis.  For instance:
− nterest rates,  commodity prices and all other exchange rates are

assumed constant. 
−  xchange rates are assumed at a year-end value instead of the more

relevant sales-weighted average figure,  which we utilise internally
to better reflect both the seasonality of our business and intra-year
currency fluctuations. 
−  he underlying forecasted cash flow exposure (which the hedge

instrument mainly relates to) is not required to be revalued in this
analysis. 
−  perational issues,  such as potential discounts to key accountsO
which have high transparency regarding the impacts of currency
on our sourcing activities (due to their own private label sourcing
efforts),  are also excluded from this presentation.

  Group M a n a gemen t Report Fin a nci a l Re v ie w 
034    Risk and Opportunity Report    Financial risks 
Nevertheless,  our net US dollar cash flow exposure after natural
hedges calculated for 2012 was roughly € 39 billion at year-end
2011,  which we hedged using forward contracts,  currency options
and currency swaps   Table 05.  Our Group's Treasury Policy allows us
to utilise hedging instruments,  such as currency options or option
combinations,  which provide protection from negative exchange
rate fluctuations while at the same time retaining the potential
to benefit from future favourable exchange rate developments in the
financial markets. 
As 2012 hedging has almost been completed,  it is clear that conversion
rates on major currencies will be slightly less favourable compared to
those of 2011.  Volume forecast variances,  greater currency volatility
and an increasing portion of our business in emerging markets will
expose the adidas Group to additional currency risks in 2012.  As a
consequence,  our assessment of currency risks remains unchanged. 
We believe the likelihood of currency risks is highly probable and we
regard the possible financial impact of currency risks as major.

Changes in global market interest rates affect future interest payments
for variable-interest liabilities.  As a result,  significant interest rate
increases can have an adverse effect on the Group's profitabilityliquidity and financial position. 
In line with IFRS 7 requirements,  we have analysed the impact of
changes in the Group's most important interest rates on net income
and shareholders' equity.  The effect of interest rate changes on future
cash flows is excluded from this analysis.  Nevertheless,  accrued
interest,  which is recognised as a liability,  has been re-calculated based
on the hypothetical market interest rates as at December 31,  2011. 
Fair values for derivative interest rate instruments accounted for as
cash flow hedges were then re-evaluated based on the hypothetical
market interest rates with the resulting effects on net income and
equity included in the sensitivity analysis.

Utilising a centralised currency risk management system,  our Group
hedges currency needs for projected sourcing requirements on a
rolling 12- to 24-month basis   see Treasury,  p.  129.  Our goal is to have
the vast majority of our hedging volume secured six months prior to
the start of a given season.  In rare instances,  hedges are contracted
beyond the 24-month horizon.  The Group also largely hedges balance
sheet risks.  Due to our strong global position,  we are able to minimise
currency risk to a large extent by utilising natural hedges.

Corporate opportunities overview 
However,  the effect on the income statement from changes in the
fair values of hedged items and hedging instruments attributable to
interest rate changes was not material.  Exclusions from this analysis
are as follows:
− ome fixed-rate financial instruments,  such as certificates of

deposit,  which our Group values at 'fair value through profit or
loss" due to the short-term maturity of these instruments.  Potential
effects due to changes in interest rates are considered immaterial
and are not recognised in the sensitivity analysis. 
−  ther fixed-rate financial instruments are measured at amortised

cost.  Since a change in interest rates would not change the carrying
amount of this category of instruments,  there is no net income
impact and they are excluded from this analysis. 

07

The interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift of the
interest yield curve for all currencies and was performed on the same
basis for both 2010 and 2011.  A 100 basis point increase in interest
rates at December 31,  2011 would have increased shareholders' equity
by € 000 million (2010: increase by € 004 million) and decreased net
income by € 007 million (2010: decrease by € 022 million).  A 100
basis point decrease of the interest rates at December 31,  2011 would
have resulted in a € 000 million decrease in shareholders' equity
(2010: decrease by € 004 million) and a € 007 million increase in net
income (2010: increase by € 022 million). 

Personalised and customised products replacing mass wear 
We believe the IFRS 7 interest rate analysis represents a realistic if
rough estimate of our current interest rate risk. 

Favourable macroeconomic developments 
To moderate interest rate risks and maintain financial flexibilitya core tenet of our Group's financial strategy is to continue to use
surplus cash flow from operations to reduce gross borrowings   see
Treasury,  p.  129.  Beyond that,  the adidas Group is constantly looking for
adequate hedging strategies through interest rate derivatives in order
to mitigate interest rate risks.

Strategic and operational opportunities
Since we are a consumer goods company,  consumer confidence and
spending can impact our sales development.  Therefore,  better than
initially forecasted macroeconomic developments,  which support
increased discretionary private consumption,  can have a positive
impact on our sales and profitability.  In addition,  legislative changese.g.  with regard to the elimination of trade barriers,  can positively
impact Group profitability. 

Growing importance of sports to fight obesity
In 2011,  interest rates in Europe and North America remained at low
levels.  Given the central banks' interest rate policies and macro­
economic uncertainty,  we do not foresee any major interest increases
in these regions for the near-term future.  In contrast,  we have
witnessed rising interest rates in emerging markets and expect this
trend to continue going forward.  However,  since 90% of the Group's
financing is in euros and US dollars,  we now regard the potential
impact of interest rate risks only as minor.  Nevertheless,  we continue
to assess the likelihood that these risks will materialise as highly
probable. 

Governments are increasingly promoting living an active lifestyle to
fight obesity and cardiovascular disease.  According to the latest International Obesity Task Force (IOTF),  more than 600 million adults are
currently considered obese.  An additional billion are estimated to
be overweight.  Furthermore,  up to 200 million school-age children
are either obese or overweight.  Once considered a problem only in
affluent nations,  obesity is also becoming an issue in countries with
low per capita income.  This development has serious health consequences and a dramatic effect on health care expenditures.  As a resultgovernments and non-governmental organisations are increasing
their efforts to promote a healthy lifestyle and encourage sports
participation.  For example,  in 2011,  the US Department of Education
awarded 76 grants with a total budget of more than US $ 35 million to
Local Education Agencies (LEAs) and community-based organisations
in order to implement comprehensive physical activity and nutrition

Emerging markets as long-term growth drivers 
Women's segment offers long-term potential 
People increasingly aim to connect fitness with social experience. 
Making fitness,  that is seen by most to be a chore,  into something fun
and enjoyable can therefore contribute significantly to drive sports
participation.  Since Reebok entered the fitness world,  it has always
been about making fitness a community experience.  In 2011,  Reebok
launched its partnership with CrossFit,  a fitness and conditioning
movement which involves a fun and motivating community experienceto help empower everyone to be fit for life.  CrossFit is one of Reebok's
key strategic programmes in establishing it as the fitness brand   see
Reebok Strategy,  p.  78. 

Ongoing fusion of sport and lifestyle
The border between pure athletics and lifestyle continues to blur as
sport becomes a more integral part in the lives of more and more
consumers.  People want to be fashionable when engaging in sporting
activities without compromising on quality or the latest technological
advances.  At the same time,  performance features and styles are
finding their way into products meant for more leisure-oriented use. 
We estimate the global sports lifestyle market to be at least three
times larger than the performance market.  This development opens
up additional opportunities for our Group and our brands,  which
already enjoy strong positions in this market.  One example of this is
the further roll-out of the adidas NEO label as part of our Route 2015
strategic business plan.  After the successful introduction in emerging
markets,  mainly Greater China and Russia,  in 2012,  we will open
10 adidas NEO label pilot stores in Germany in order to test this fastfashion model in a mature market   see adidas Strategy,  p.  72. 

Our Group still generates the majority of its revenues in men's and
unisex categories.  However,  with women accounting for more than a
third of total spending on athletic footwear,  we believe the women's
sports market is one of the most attractive segments in the sporting
goods industry.  The adidas Group will therefore continue to invest in
developing women-specific product offerings in both performance and
lifestyle that emphasise female individuality,  authenticity and style. 
Examples today include the adidas by Stella McCartney collectiontoning footwear and apparel at Reebok,  as well as a series of Burner
drivers and irons at TaylorMade specifically designed for women. 
Furthermore,  2011 saw the opening of the first adidas Women's stores
in Russia and South Korea.  The stores are exclusive locations for
stylish and high-end adidas Women's collections in two very attractive
markets for the adidas Group.

Creating new social experiences to drive
sports participation 
The global population has grown rapidly over the last decades andaccording to estimates by the United Nations,  passed the 7 billion mark
in 2011.  This development is projected to continue,  with the global
population estimated to exceed 9 billion by 2050.  A large portion of
this growth will be in emerging economies.  Low unemployment ratesrising real incomes as well as a growing middle class with increasing
spending power are fuelling these economies and subsequently our
industry.  Sports participation in countries such as China or India has
historically been lower than in industrialised countries.  We expect
sports participation rates to increase over time with increasing leisure
time,  investment in infrastructure and the broadening of awareness
of the benefits of physical activity.  In addition,  European and North
American sporting goods brands are often seen as highly desirableeasily accessible,  affordable luxury goods in emerging markets,  which
presents an additional growth opportunity.

programmes for their students through the Carol M.  White Physical
Education Program (PEP).  Similar health-promoting programmes and
initiatives are being launched or expanded around the world.  Given the
strong global market position the adidas brand enjoys,  in particular in
categories considered suitable for weight loss such as training and
running,  we expect to benefit from this trend.  Furthermore,  in association with the London 2012 Olympic Games,  adidas is also launching
multi-sport outdoor venues called 'adiZones' in the UK,  that are
designed to encourage people to participate in sport.  The adiZones
will be free for the community to use and will help to break down the
barriers that prevent people from getting active,  making sport participation accessible.  In addition,  Reebok is an official partner of 'Build
Our Kids' Success' ('BOKS').  Partnering with schools across the USAthe collective mission of BOKS is to provide opportunities for children
to be physically active and create healthier habits to achieve lifelong
fitness.

Increasing consumer demand for functional apparel 
20

11

160

Social media offering new ways to engage consumers 
Consumer demand for functional apparel has increased significantly
in recent years as consumers realise the benefits of functional apparel
over traditional cotton sportswear.  Improved heat and moisture
management,  superior ease of motion and increased comfort are
all factors encouraging consumers to switch to high-performance
apparel.  The design and development of functional apparel requires
significantly more expertise,  product and material research as well as
production know-how compared to low-tech apparel.  Therefore,  very
few companies are able to supply high-end functional apparel.  Our
resources and our positioning as a sports performance leader enable
us to constantly develop innovative products and capitalise on them
commercially   see global brands strategy,  p.  68. 

Advances in digital communication offer significant opportunities for
our brands to engage with consumers more frequently,  and enhance
our opportunity to build long-lasting relationships and brand loyalty. 
The adidas Group constantly monitors the latest developments and
trends in communication technologies.  The emergence of social
media and social networks is one such example which is already
helping our brands increase their consumer reach.  In this regard,  we
are investing considerable resources to present the adidas Group's
brands through a variety of social media platforms,  such as FacebookYouTube or Twitter.  This is reflected in our far higher growth rate of
fans and viewers on these different social media platforms compared
to industry peers.  For example,  the adidas Originals Facebook page
alone has attracted more than 12 million followers,  adding more than
 million fans over the 12-month period.  A key advantage of these tools
is that they allow our brands to engage in a direct dialogue with our
consumers.  For example,  by offering consumers the opportunity to
actively participate in brand campaigns or in the design and creation of
new products,  we can generate a far superior brand experience which
resonates in particular with the young generation.  In 2011,  adidas
also made substantial progress offering mobile applications to our
consumers.  Both the miCoach Football app as well as the miCoach
Running app allow athletes to upload stats to the interactive adidas
training system and to share stats via social media.  Data can then be
analysed and compared with friends,  followers,  and even some of the
top athletes in the world. 

Growing popularity of 'green" products
Today's consumers are increasingly aware of the impact their
consumption has on the environment.  Therefore,  they demand
more products that are environmentally benign and produced
on a sustainable basis.  The adidas Group continues its efforts to
create meaningful product platforms that drive growth in this area. 
We remain focused on the extension of the adidas "Better Place"
programme,  for which the first products were introduced globally in
2009.  Products and packaging in the programme are designed taking
sustainability principles into account,  such as broadening the use of
recycled materials and monitoring energy use in material and product
preparation.  With all adidas Sport Performance categories participating in the programme,  the adidas Group is moving forward with
ambitious plans in the build-up to the London 2012 Olympic Games. 
For example,  adidas is working closely with the London Olympic
Games Organising Committee (LOCOG) in contributing to the sustainability goals of the Games   see Sustainability,  p.  107.  Reebok has also
been steadily introducing eco-friendly products.  The Kids' Green Easy
collection addresses environmental concerns by utilising recycled raw
materials for toddler and infant footwear.  Launched in 2010,  the Kids'
Green Easy collection was successfully continued throughout 2011. 
Our efforts to use environmentally friendly materials in our products
are,  of course,  not exclusive to these specific programmes,  they are
also used in other categories,  albeit to a lesser extent. 

Leveraging strong market positions worldwide
The adidas Group is the market leader in numerous countries around
the world.  This strong competitive position offers us many advantages
in terms of global brand visibility,  market power and the ability to
effectively expand our position in emerging markets.  As a result of our
strong partnership portfolio and marketing efforts,  consumers around
the globe are highly aware of our brands and are receptive to our
brand messaging.  This makes demand for our products more stable
compared to smaller competitors.  Hence,  many retailers consider
our products as core to their offering.  Furthermore,  with our global
retail coverage and distribution network,  we are able to leverage our
infrastructure to introduce and more rapidly expand our brands and
product offerings to markets where they previously did not exist.  The
adidas Group can therefore compete more effectively for retail space. 

Multi-brand approach
Given the diverse tastes and expectations of a highly fragmented
consumer market,  there is a natural limit to the audience size a single
brand can appeal to.  Our multi-brand approach provides us with the
opportunity to leverage the power of our brands in a more precise
and meaningful way   see Group Strategy,  p.  60.  We are able to utilise the
combined strengths of each brand to compete for a higher percentage
of the total market covering a greater number of demographicsconsumer needs and price points.

Expanding distribution scope 
Exploiting potential of new and fast-growing
sports categories
Exploiting the potential of emerging,  fast-growing sports categories is
another opportunity for our brands.  Our brand teams conduct market
research and engage in trend marketing to detect changes in lifestyle
and consumer needs of our target audience as early as possible. 
Changes in lifestyle,  habits and attitudes can potentially result in the
emergence of new consumer needs that are not addressed by current
market product offerings.  For example,  we see a growing trend in the
move by athletes and sports enthusiasts towards more minimalistic
products that promote natural body movement.  In order to tap into
this opportunity,  we are expanding our efforts to bring to market more
lightweight and flexible products that support the athlete's natural
course of motion.  In April 2011,  Reebok launched RealFlex,  a running
and training shoe designed to promote natural movement.  Also in 2011adidas unveiled its first barefoot training shoe designed specifically for
the gym,  the adipure Trainer   see adidas Strategy,  p.  72.  Promoting pure
and natural movement by harnessing the body's natural mechanicsthe adipure Trainer activates and strengthens muscles,  builds balance
and promotes dexterity.  Similarly,  we see tremendous growth potential
in the outdoor and action sport categories and intend to become a
leading player in those categories over the next years.  Complementing
this ambition,  in November 2011,  the adidas Group acquired Five Tena leading brand in the technical outdoor market,  which enjoys high
credibility within the outdoor action sport community. 

The sporting goods retail environment is changing constantly.  People
increasingly want to get involved with our brands.  We therefore
continue to adapt our distribution strategy to cater for this change
and have made controlled space initiatives a strategic priority.  This
includes retail space management with key retail partners as well
as the introduction of new own-retail store formats.  For example,  in
December 2011,  adidas celebrated the opening of its first Style Centre
in Beijing.  The 400m² store is the first one globally to house the three
sub-brands SLVR,  Y-3 and Porsche Design Sport under one roof.  The
three labels have individual retail environments representing their
unique identities.  Throughout the year,  we continued to roll out new
shop-in-shop concepts globally and also further invested in unique
point-of-sale activation.  In February 2011,  for example,  all 680 Finish
Line stores in the USA were outfitted with ZigTech imagery.  Through
initiatives like these,  we believe we will be able to target our consumers
more effectively,  involve them emotionally with our products andtherefore,  ultimately drive sell-through at our retail partners. 

Cost optimisation drives profitability improvements
Continued optimisation of key business processes and strict cost
control are vital to achieving high profitability and return on invested
capital.  We are confident that there is still significant opportunity to
further streamline cost structures throughout our Group.  In order to
achieve our Route 2015 targets,  we are working on various efficiency
projects to minimise costs and drive operational performance.  For
example,  we continuously search for ways to increase efficiency in
our supply chain and make it truly demand-driven.  Furthermoreby implementing end-to-end planning processes and improving our
replenishment capabilities,  we see opportunities to not only better
serve our customers but also to reduce our operating working capital
needs   see Global Operations,  p.  90.  Another example in this respect is
the reduction of the number of articles; this reduces workload in
the creation area and warehouse costs,  and allows us to offer more
focused ranges to our retail partners.

Today's consumers are looking for choice and variety that go beyond
choosing from a wide selection of products.  We engage in developing
unique and relevant products that fit specific functional and aesthetic
requirements   see Group Strategy,  p.  60.  For example,  the adidas,  Reebok
and TaylorMade brands all offer different personalisation and customisation platforms reflecting each brand's strategy.  Key concepts
at adidas include mi adidas,  miTeam and miCoach.  For examplemiCoach is a personalised training concept that combines product
technologies with an intelligent web platform.  It offers a personal
and real-time audible coaching system,  enabling the consumer to
collect and visualise real-life performance data.  In 2011,  adidas
launched both the miCoach Football app as well as the miCoach
Running app and thus reached a new milestone in personalisation. 
With mi adidas and 'Your Reebok",  consumers can already design and
order completely customised adidas and Reebok footwear online and
therefore create their own unique style.  At TaylorMade-adidas Golfthe myTPball online platform offers customers the opportunity to
create and order their own golf balls.  In addition,  TaylorMade-adidas
Golf's Centres of Excellence provide customised fitting sessions for
golfers with expert fitters and technicians.  We expect the market for
personalised and customised footwear,  apparel and hardware to grow
strongly and evolve further in the coming years and we will therefore
continue to invest in the space.

Favourable financial market changes
Favourable exchange and interest rate developments can potentially
have a positive impact on the Group's financial results.  Our Group
Treasury department closely monitors the financial markets to identify
and exploit opportunities   see Treasury,  p.  129. 

Compared to the prior year,  our assessment of certain risks has

Management remains confident that the Group's earnings strength
forms a solid basis for our future business development and provides
the necessary resource to pursue the opportunities available to the
Group. 

Nonetheless,  the changes in individual risks have no substantial
impact on the overall adidas Group risk profile,  which we believe
remains unchanged compared to the prior year.

This Management Report contains forward-looking statements
that reflect Management's current view with respect to the future
develop­ ent of the adidas Group.  The outlook is based on estimates

that we have made on the basis of all the information available to us
at this point in time.  In addition,  such forward-looking statements
are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the Risk and
Opportunity Report,  which are beyond the control of the adidas Group 
 see Risk and Opportunity Report,  p.  145.  In case the underlying assumptions

Report beyond statutory disclosure obligations. 

Global economic growth to slow in 2012
Considering the current political,  economic policy and debt-related
risks,  the development of the global economy is subject to a high degree
of uncertainty.  According to the World Bank,  global GDP is projected
to increase 25% in 2012 (2011: 27%).  Expectations are that the euro
area is likely to enter a recession,  while Japan's economic growth is
expected to be very modest.  The consensus remains that the majority
of the world's economic growth will continue to be derived from the
emerging economies,  particularly in Asia and Latin America.  These
positive economic growth expectations and the outlook for consumer
spending,  particularly in the emerging markets,  are forecasted to be
supportive to our growth aspirations in 2012. 

In Western Europe,  GDP is forecasted to decrease around 06%
in 2012.  The euro area debt crisis is expected to result in further
fiscal belt tightening and austerity measures.  A reduction in industrial activity and exports will also add to the challenges of debt,  high
unemployment levels and weak domestic demand in much of the
region.  Nevertheless,  Germany,  the region's largest economy,  has
historically low unemployment levels and firm wage growth,  which is
expected to sustain consumer demand.  In the UK,  GDP is expected
to increase by 07%,  with the economy benefiting from hosting the
London 2012 Olympic Games.  In European Emerging Marketssignifi­ ant regional markets such as Russia and Poland are forecasted

to grow 30% and 24%,  respectively.  Russia,  in particular,  is expected
to continue benefiting from relatively high energy prices,  as well as
strong domestic consumption and investments. 
In the USA,  GDP is forecasted to grow 25% in 2012.  Expansion of
the US economy is expected to be supported by the extension of the
2 percentage point payroll tax cut,  the Emergency Unemployment
Compensation (EUC) programme and interest rates remaining
at near-zero levels.  Despite these stimuli,  the US economy faces
substantial headwinds in 2012.  Financial market stress and uncertainties in Europe are likely to adversely affect business confidence
and lead to cautious investment spending.  Nonetheless,  slight
improvements in the labour and housing markets are forecasted to
help maintain some momentum in consumer spending. 
In Asia,  GDP is expected to grow 45% in 2012.  Leading economic
indicators point to a slowdown in inflation and continued wage growthwhich is expected to support consumer spending.  In China,  exports
and the housing market are currently expected to contract.  Howeverdomestic demand and investments are forecasted to remain strong
and drive GDP up 86%.  In India,  GDP is expected to be up 72% in 2012with solid domestic demand and exports sustaining growth.  In Japanthe effects of the government's significant stimulus programmes
implemented in 2011 will begin to fade in the second half of the year. 
However,  export-driven industrial production and slight increases in
domestic demand are forecasted to yield a 10% increase in Japan's
GDP in 2012.

In 2012,  despite a high degree of economic uncertainty,  we expect the global economy to grow,  with the
adidas Group to benefit from continued healthy demand for sporting goods.  Through our industry-leading
innovative strength,  the extensive pipeline of new and fresh products as well as positive effects from
major sporting events,  we project top- and bottom-line improvements in our Group's financial results
in 2012.  We forecast adidas Group sales to increase at a mid- to high-single-digit rate on a currencyneutral basis due to growth in the Wholesale and Retail segments as well as in Other Businesses.  Group
gross margin is expected to be around 475%.  Pressures from higher input costs will weigh on otherwise
positive effects anticipated from regional and product mix enhancements as well as product price
increases.  Group operating margin is forecasted to increase to a level approaching 80%,  driven by lower
other operating expenses as a percentage of sales.  As a result,  we project earnings per share to grow at
a rate between 10% and 15% to a level between € 352 and € 368.

In Latin America,  GDP growth rates are likely to moderate to a level
of around 35% in 2012.  A healthy labour market,  strong domestic
investment levels,  robust private consumption rates and industrial
production are all forecasted to support economic activity in the
region.  Relatively high commodity prices are also expected to continue
to contribute to growth.  However,  inflation as well as an expected fall
in exports to Europe are concerns for economic growth in the region.

Sporting goods industry growth to continue in 2012
In the absence of any major economic shocks,  we expect the global
sporting goods industry to expand in 2012,  however with significant
regional variation.  Following macroeconomic trends,  consumer
spending on sporting goods in the emerging economies will
outperform the more developed markets.  Inflationary pressuresparticularly in relation to commodity prices,  are expected to moderate
in the second half of the year.  However,  wage growth in the fastergrowing economies will continue to add significant costs to the
industry,  especially where the industry sources and manufactures. 
 contraction in private consumption in mature markets such as the
USA and Western Europe is forecasted for 2012 and will detract from
expansion of the industry in those regions.  While growth rates will
moderate compared to 2011,  the sporting goods sector is expected
to continue to grow rapidly in the emerging economies,  especially in
China and India.  Furthermore,  the global sporting goods industry will
be positively impacted by two of sport's largest events in 2012 the
London 2012 Olympic Games and the UEFA EURO 2012. 
In Europe,  the sporting goods industry is expected to grow modestly
in 2012,  with significant regional variation.  In many markets,  sporting
goods retail activity is forecasted to be negatively affected by austerity
measures,  low wage growth and reduced consumer spending
compared to 2011.  However,  the region hosts both the London 2012
Olympic Games (UK) and the UEFA EURO 2012 (Poland and Ukraine)which are expected to support the industry. 
In North America,  industry growth rates are expected to moderate
compared to the prior year,  in line with overall consumer spending
expectations.  From a category perspective,  running (particularly lightweight running),  training and high-performance basketball are seen
as significant sporting goods drivers for the year.  The US golf market
is expected to see continued consolidation in 2012. 

In Greater China,  wage growth and domestic consumption are set
to continue to propel sporting goods sales in 2012.  The trend and
market share shift towards international brands is also expected to
continue,  as local players struggle with declining brand image as well
as inventory and product ageing issues. 
In other Asian markets,  the sporting goods industry is forecasted
to grow in 2012,  however with regional variances.  Japan's sporting
goods industry is expected to expand compared to 2011,  albeit at a
moderate rate given that overall consumer confidence and spending
are expected to remain low.  Most of the other major Asian emerging
markets are expected to see rapid sporting goods sales growth in 2012as domestic demand increases and rising wages drive purchases of
discretionary items. 
The sporting goods industry in Latin America is projected to grow
in 2012,  with a healthy labour market and wage growth expected to
continue.  These developments are forecasted to promote consumer
spending and support discretionary purchases in the region,  positively
impacting the sporting goods sector. 

adidas Group currency-neutral sales to increase at a
mid- to high-single-digit rate in 2012
We expect adidas Group sales to increase at a mid- to high-singledigit rate on a currency-neutral basis in 2012.  Despite the high degree
of uncertainty regarding the global economic outlook and consumer
spending,  Group sales development will be favourably impacted by our
high exposure to fast-growing emerging markets as well as the further
expansion of Retail.  In addition,  this year's major sporting events will
provide positive stimulus to Group sales.  As Official Sponsor of the
UEFA EURO 2012 in Poland and Ukraine,  the adidas brand will benefit
from additional sales in the football category.  And as the Official
Sportswear Partner of the London 2012 Olympic Games and Team
GB,  the adidas brand will be the most visible brand during the event. 
This event not only provides an excellent platform to increase the
brand's presence in the important UK market,  but also to present its
perform­ nce credentials globally.

Currency-neutral Wholesale revenues expected to
increase at a mid-single-digit rate
We project currency-neutral Wholesale segment revenues to increase
at a mid-single-digit rate compared to the prior year.  Our growth expectations are supported by order backlog development,  positive retailer
and trade show feedback as well as the positive impact from the major
sporting events.  Currency-neutral adidas Sport ­ erformance sales

are forecasted to increase at a low- to mid-single-digit rate due to
growth in most categories,  particularly football,  running and training. 
adidas Sport Style revenues are projected to increase at a high-singleto low-double-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis as a result of the
expanded distribution scope and continued momentum in our product
lines,  in particular adidas Originals.  Currency-neutral Reebok sales
are expected to decrease due to the negative impact from the discontinuation of the NFL licence agreement,  and the shift of the US-related
NHL licensed apparel business to the Reebok-CCM Hockey segmentbeginning in 2012. 

Retail sales to increase at a low-teens rate on a
currency-neutral basis
adidas Group currency-neutral Retail segment sales are projected to
grow at a low-teens rate in 2012.  Expansion of the Group's own-retail
store base and comparable store sales are expected to contribute at a
similar rate to the revenue growth.  The Group expects a net increase
of its store base by around 100 to 150 adidas and Reebok stores in
2012.  We plan to open around 250 new stores,  depending on the 
availability of desired locations.  New stores will primarily be located in
emerging markets in Eastern Europe.  Approximately 100 to 150 stores
will be closed over the course of the year.  Around 180 stores will be
remodelled.  Comparable store sales are expected to increase at a
mid- to high-single-digit rate compared to the prior year.  As a result
of the improvements in concept store operations,  we project concept
store growth rates to be slightly better than those of factory outlets. 

Currency-neutral sales of Other Businesses to grow at a
low- to mid-single-digit rate
In 2012,  revenues of Other Businesses are expected to increase at a
low- to mid-single-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis.  TaylorMadeadidas Golf currency-neutral sales are projected to grow at a low- to
mid-single-digit rate compared to the prior year.  Despite sluggish
trends in the global golf market,  the segment's sales development
should be positively impacted by product innovation in core categories
such as metalwoods,  irons and wedges.  Revenues at Rockport are
forecasted to increase at a high-single-digit rate as a result of improvements in the brand's product portfolio and own-retail expansion.  Sales
at Reebok-CCM Hockey are expected to grow at a strong double-digit
rate.  This development mainly reflects the shift of the US-related NHL
licensed apparel business from the Wholesale and Retail segments
to the Reebok-CCM Hockey segment beginning on January 1,  2012.

166

We expect Group currency-neutral revenues to increase in all our
regions in 2012,  however at varying growth rates.  In Western Europealthough the highly challenging macroeconomic environment is
projected to negatively impact consumer spending,  the UEFA EURO
2012 as well as the London 2012 Olympic Games will benefit the
develop­ment of Group sales.  In European Emerging Markets,  the major
sporting events will also provide positive stimulus.  In addition,  the
expansion of,  and increasing sophistication in,  our own-retail activitiesparticularly in Russia/CIS,  are forecasted to have a positive influence
on Group sales.  In North America,  we expect solid growth despite the
discontinuation of the NFL licence agreement.  With the adidas brandwe will continue to build on the momentum we have created in this
market over the past two years as we further strengthen our product
offering,  distribution scope as well as consumer engagement initiatives.  In Greater China,  following strong double-digit sales increases
in 2011,  we expect further growth in line with our Route 2015 aspirations.  This development will be primarily driven by expanding and
solidifying our distribution footprint,  including the further roll-out of
adidas Originals and the adidas NEO label.  In Other Asian Marketschallenging conditions in Japan will be more than offset by a strong
performance in the region's other markets such as South Korea and
South East Asia.  Lastly,  in Latin America,  Group sales development
is projected to be positively impacted by the solid momentum of the
region's sporting goods industry.  However,  trade barriers in certain
markets continue to weigh on growth prospects. 

Group other operating expenses to decrease as a
percentage of sales
In 2012,  the Group's other operating expenses as a percentage of sales
are expected to decrease modestly (2011: 414%).  Sales and marketing
working budget expenses as a percentage of sales are projected to
be at a similar level to the prior year.  Marketing investments will be
centred around key sporting events such as the UEFA EURO 2012 and
the London 2012 Olympic Games to leverage the outstanding visibility
of the adidas brand during these events.  Further,  we will continue to
support Reebok's growth strategy in the men's and women's fitness
category and will also invest in growing our key attack markets North
America,  Greater China and Russia/CIS.  Operating overhead expenditure as a percentage of sales is forecasted to decline in 2012.  Higher
administrative and personnel expenses in the Retail segment due
to the planned expansion of the Group's store base will be offset by
leverage in the Group's non-allocated central costs. 
We expect the number of employees within the adidas Group to
increase versus the prior year level.  Additional hires will be mainly
related to own-retail expansion.  The majority of new hires will be
employed on a part-time basis and will be located in emerging
markets.  The adidas Group will continue to spend around 1% of Group
sales on research and development in 2012.  Areas of particular focus
include customisation and digital sports products at adidas,  as well as
supporting the expansion of Reebok's fitness positioning   see Research
and Development,  p.  95. 

2012 Group gross margin to be around 475%

Operating margin to continue to expand 
In 2012,  the adidas Group gross margin is forecasted to be around
475% (2011: 475%).  While we expect gross margin in our Retail
segment as well as Other Businesses to improve,  gross margin in
the Wholesale segment is forecasted to decline.  As in the prior yeargross margin development will be negatively impacted by increasing
input and labour costs year-over-year,  particularly in the first half of
2012.  In addition,  hedging terms in 2012 will be slightly less favourable
compared to the prior year.  However,  these negative influences will
be largely offset by positive regional mix effects,  as growth rates in
high-margin emerging markets are projected to be above growth
rates in more mature markets.  In addition,  improvements in the Retail
segment as well as at the Reebok brand will positively influence Group
gross margin development.  Furthermore,  product price increases are
also forecasted to benefit the Group gross margin development. 

In 2012,  we expect the operating margin for the adidas Group to
increase to a level approaching 80% (2011: 76%).  Lower other
operating expenses as a percentage of sales are expected to be the
primary driver of the improvement.

035    Subsequent Events and Outlook 
Efficient liquidity management in place for 2012
and beyond
Efficient liquidity management continues to be a priority for the adidas
Group in 2012.  We focus on continuously anticipating the operating
cash flows of our Group segments,  as this represents the main
source of liquidity within the Group.  On a quarterly basis,  liquidity is
forecasted on a multi-year financial and liquidity plan.  Long-term
liquidity is ensured by continued positive operating cash flows and
sufficient unused committed and uncommitted credit facilities.  In
2012,  we plan to replace our syndicated loan facility,  which matures
during the course of the year   see Treasury,  p.  129. 

Average operating working capital as a percentage
of sales to increase 
Management to propose dividend of € 100

In 2012,  average operating working capital as a percentage of sales is
expected to increase slightly compared to the prior year level (2011:
208%).  This is mainly due to working capital increases to support the
growth of our business. 

Investment level to be between € 400 million
and € 450 million
In 2012,  investments in tangible and intangible assets are expected to
amount to € 400 million to € 450 million (2011: € 376 million).  Investments will focus on adidas and Reebok controlled space initiatives,  in
particular in emerging markets.  These investments will account for
around 40% of total investments in 2012.  Other areas of investment
include the Group's logistics infrastructure such as the construction of
our biggest distribution centre worldwide near Osnabrueck,  Germanyand the increased deployment of SAP and other IT systems in major
subsidiaries within the Group.  All investments within the adidas Group
in 2012 are expected to be fully financed through cash generated from
operating activities. 

In light of the strong cash flow generation in 2011 and resulting net
cash position at year-end,  Management will recommend paying a
dividend of € 100 to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting
(AGM) on May 10,  2012,  representing an increase of 25% compared
to the prior year (2010: € 080).  Subject to shareholder approval,  the
dividend will be paid on May 11,  2012.  The proposal represents a payout
ratio of 31% of net income attributable to shareholders,  compared to
30% in the prior year.  This complies with our dividend policy,  according
to which we intend to pay out between 20% and 40% of net income
attributable to shareholders annually.  Based on the number of shares
outstanding at the end of 2011,  the dividend payout will thus increase
to € 209 million compared to € 167 million in the prior year. 

Excess cash to be used to support growth initiatives
In 2012,  we expect continued positive cash flow from operating
activities.  Cash will be used to finance working capital needsinvestment activities,  as well as dividend payments.  We intend to
largely use excess cash to invest in our Route 2015 growth initiatives
and to further reduce gross borrowings.  In order to ensure long-term
flexibility,  we aim to maintain a ratio of net borrowings over EBITDA of
less than two times as measured at year-end (2011 ratio: –01).

Basic and diluted earnings per share are expected to increase at a
rate of 10% to 15% to a level between € 352 and € 368 (2011: € 320). 
Top-line improvement and an increased operating margin will be the
primary drivers of this positive development.  In addition,  we expect
lower interest rate expenses in 2012 as a result of a lower average
level of gross borrowings.  The Group tax rate is expected to be slightly
less favourable compared to the prior year,  at a level around 285%
(2011: 277%).

168

Based on the adidas Group's strong brands,  premium productsextensive global presence and its commitment to innovation and the
consumer,  the adidas Group aspires to grow its business significantly
until 2015.  According to our strategic business plan Route 2015,  total
Group sales are targeted to grow 45% to 50% on a currency-neutral
basis over the five-year period,  thereby outperforming total market
growth (both GDP and sporting goods industry).  In addition,  we aim
to grow our bottom line faster than the top line.  It is targeted to grow
annual earnings at a compound annual growth rate of 15% and to
reach an operating margin of 11% sustainably by 2015 at the latest. 
For 2013,  in line with our mid-term guidance,  we project adidas Group
sales and net income to increase compared to 2012. 
In order to reach our strategic goals and create long-term sustainable
shareholder value,  we have defined clear strategic pillars.  These
include:
– Clear market positioning and brand prioritisation: We believe that
we have significant growth potential to exploit from our portfolio of
brands.  The majority of our targeted growth will come from Global
Brands,  which we anticipate will contribute 90% of the Group's
expected revenue increase over the period   see Global Brands Strategyp.  68.  Areas within the adidas and Reebok brands that have been
identified as key contributors to sustainable growth for the adidas
Group include:
–  didas Sport Performance: gaining sales and market share in the

running and basketball categories
–  didas Sport Style: expanding in the fast-fashion business with the

adidas NEO label
–  eebok: establishing Reebok as the leading fitness brand

–  eading the industry in the fields of customisation and interactivity

By brand,  we expect adidas Sport Performance sales to grow at a
mid- to high-single-digit compound annual growth rate.  We plan
to increase adidas Sport Style and Reebok sales at a double-digit
compound annual growth rate until 2015. 

– Expand presence in key growth markets: We have identified North
America,  Greater China,  Russia/CIS,  Latin America,  Japan and the UK
as key growth markets.  Of those markets,  the three "attack markets"
North America,  Greater China and Russia/CIS are expected to
contribute around 50% of the total Group growth under the Route 2015
plan,  with each market targeting a double-digit compound annual
growth rate.  In the USA,  the Group's brands have enormous potential
to gain market share by focusing on improved distribution and allowing
 higher share of products to be specifically designed for that market. 
In emerging markets such as China and Russia,  rising standards of
living,  increasing disposable income,  positive demographic trends
and growing sports participation should support demand for sporting
goods. 
– Intensify controlled space focus: We intend to increase the portion
of sales that comes from controlled space initiatives to at least
45% of Group sales in the coming years (2011: 36%).  This includes
new openings of adidas and Reebok own-retail stores,  the further
extension of our mono-branded franchise store base in markets such
as China,  as well as new shop-in-shop initiatives with retail partners
around the world.  In terms of our own retail,  we intend to open at
least 550 adidas and Reebok stores over the five-year period,  as well
as grow significantly our eCommerce business,  which we project to
increase to € 500 million by 2015   see Global Sales Strategy,  p.  62. 
– Leverage growth and operational scale through to bottom line: A
higher exposure to emerging markets as well as expanding controlled
space activities are important levers to improving brand presenceincreasing sell-through and driving higher Group profitability.  In
addition,  we continuously work on streamlining internal processes
to accelerate decision-making,  reduce complexity and make our
organisation leaner and more efficient.  Therefore,  we believe there is
significant potential to increase the Group's operating margin to 11%
sustainably by 2015. 
– 
Maintain financial flexibility: We strive over the long term to
maintain a ratio of net borrowings over EBITDA of less than two times. 
 strong balance sheet increases our flexibility to realise value-­
generating medium- and long-term opportunities in the best interests
of our shareholders as they arise.

Auditor's Report 
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with § 317 HGB and German
generally accepted standards for the audit of financial statements promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer
(Institute of Public Auditors in Germany) (IDW).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit such
that misstatements materially affecting the presentation of the net assets,  financial position and profit or loss in
the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework and in the
Group management report are detected with reasonable assurance.  Knowledge of the business activities and the
economic and legal environment of the Group and expectations as to possible misstatements are taken into account
in the determination of audit procedures.  The effectiveness of the accounting-related internal control system and the
evidence supporting the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and the Group management report are
examined primarily on a test basis within the framework of the audit.  The audit includes assessing the annual financial
statements of the entities included in consolidation,  the determination of entities to be included in consolidation,  the
accounting and consolidation principles used and significant estimates made by management,  as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and Group management report.  We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
Our audit has not led to any reservations. 
In our opinion,  based on the findings of our audit,  the consolidated financial statements comply with IFRS,  as adopted
by the EU,  and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315a (1) HGB and give a true and
fair view of the net assets,  financial position and profit or loss of the Group in accordance with these requirements.  The
Group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and as a whole provides a suitable
view of the Group's position and suitably presents the opportunities and risks of future development.

Item 
Principles of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of adidas AG and its direct and indirect subsidiaries,  which
are prepared in accordance with uniform accounting principles.  A
company is considered a subsidiary if it is controlled by adidas AG,  e.g. 
by directly or indirectly governing the financial and operating policies
of the respective enterprise. 
The number of consolidated subsidiaries evolved as follows for
the years ending December 31,  2011 and 2010,  respectively:

Short-term financial assets 
At fair value through profit or loss

adidas AG,  Herzogenaurach,  p.  218.  Furthermore,  the schedule of the shareholdings of adidas AG will be published on the electronic platform of
the German Federal Gazette. 
Within the scope of the first-time consolidation,  all acquired
assets and liabilities are recognised in the statement of financial
position at fair value at the acquisition date.  A debit difference between
the acquisition cost and the proportionate fair value of assets,  liabilities and contingent liabilities is shown as goodwill.  A credit difference
is recorded in the income statement. 
Acquisitions of additional investments in subsidiaries which are
already controlled are recorded as equity transactions.  Thereforeneither fair value adjustments of assets and liabilities nor gains or
losses are recognised.  Any difference between the cost for such an
additional investment and the carrying amount of the net assets at the
acquisition date is directly recorded in shareholders' equity. 
The financial effects of intercompany transactions,  as well as
any unrealised gains and losses arising from intercompany business
relations are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial
statements.

Currency translation
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the respective functional currency by applying the spot exchange rate valid at the
transaction date to the foreign currency amount. 
In the individual financial statements of Group companiesmonetary items denominated in non-functional currencies of the
subsidiaries are generally translated into the functional currency
at closing exchange rates at the balance sheet date.  The resulting
currency gains and losses are recorded directly in the income
statement.

Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments,  such as currency
options,  forward contracts as well as interest rate swaps and crosscurrency interest rate swaps,  to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange
and interest rate risks.  In accordance with its Treasury Policy,  the
Group does not enter into transactions with derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. 
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised in the
statement of financial position at fair value,  and subsequently also
measured at their fair value.  The method of recognising the resulting
gains or losses is dependent on the nature of the hedge.  On the date a
derivative contract is entered into,  the Group designates derivatives as
either a hedge of a forecasted transaction (cash flow hedge),  a hedge
of the fair value of a recognised asset or liability (fair value hedge) or a
hedge of a net investment in a foreign entity. 
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and
qualify as cash flow hedges,  and that are effective,  as defined in IAS
39 'Financial instruments: recognition and measurement",  are recognised in equity.  When the effectiveness is not 100%,  the ineffective
portion of the change in the fair value is recognised in the income
statement.  Accumulated gains and losses in equity are transferred to
the income statement in the same periods during which the hedged
forecasted transaction affects the income statement. 

Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents represent cash at banks,  cash on hand and
short-term deposits with maturities of three months or less from the
date of acquisition. 
Cash equivalents are short-term,  highly liquid investments that
are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are
subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 

Receivables and other financial assets	
Receivables and other financial assets are recognised at fair valuewhich correspond to the nominal value for current receivables and
other financial assets.  For non-current receivables and other financial assets,  the fair value is estimated as the present value of future
cash flows discounted at the market rate of interest at the balance
sheet date.  Subsequently,  these are measured at amortised cost using
the 'effective interest method".  If necessary,  required allowances are
determined on the basis of individual risk assessment and of the
ageing structure of receivables past due. 

  adidas Group 
2011 Annual Report 
183
11

For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges,  the gains
or losses on the derivatives and the offsetting gains or losses on the
hedged items are recognised immediately in the income statement. 
Certain derivative transactions,  while providing effective economic
hedges under the Group's risk management policies,  may not qualify
for hedge accounting under the specific rules of IAS 39.  Changes in the
fair value of any derivative instruments that do not meet these rules
are recognised immediately in the income statement. 
Hedges of net investments in foreign entities are accounted for
in a similar way to cash flow hedges.  If,  for example,  the hedging
instrument is a derivative (e.g.  a forward contract) or,  for examplea foreign currency borrowing,  effective currency gains and losses in
the derivative and all gains and losses arising on the translation of the
borrowing,  respectively,  are recognised in equity. 
The Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedge objects at transaction inception,  as well as the risk
management objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge
transactions.  This process includes linking all derivatives designated
as hedges to specific firm commitments and forecasted transactions. 
The Group also documents its assessment of whether the derivatives
that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective by using
different methods of effectiveness testing,  such as the 'dollar offset
method" or the 'hypothetical derivative method". 
The fair values of forward contracts and currency options are
determined on the basis of market conditions on the reporting dates. 
The fair value of a currency option is determined using generally
accepted models to calculate option prices.  The fair market value of
an option is influenced not only by the remaining term of the option
but also by additional factors,  such as the actual foreign exchange rate
and the volatility of the underlying foreign currency base.

Assets and liabilities of the Group's non-euro functional currency
subsidiaries are translated into the presentation currency,  the 'euro"which is also the functional currency of adidas AG,  at closing exchange
rates at the balance sheet date.  For practical reasons,  revenues and
expenses are translated at average rates for the period which approximate the exchange rates on the transaction dates.  All cumulative differences from the translation of equity of foreign subsidiaries
resulting from changes in exchange rates,  are included in a separate item within shareholders' equity without affecting the income
statement.

Impairment losses	

Merchandise and finished goods are valued at the lower of cost or
net realisable value,  which is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and
the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.  Costs are determined
using a standard valuation method: the 'average cost method".  Costs
of finished goods include cost of raw materials,  direct labour and the
components of the manufacturing overheads which can reasonably
be attributed.  The allocation of overheads is based on the planned
average utilisation.  The net realisable value allowances are computed
consistently throughout the Group based on the age and expected
future sales of the items on hand. 

If facts and circumstances indicate that non-current assets (e.g.  property,  plant and equipment,  intangible assets including goodwill and
certain financial assets) might be impaired,  the recoverable amount
is determined.  It is measured at the higher of its fair value less costs
to sell and value in use.  An impairment loss is recognised in other
operating expenses if the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable
amount.  If there is an impairment loss for a cash-generating unit,  first
the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cash-generating
unit is reduced,  and subsequently the other non-current assets of the
unit are reduced pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each
asset in the unit. 
Irrespective of whether there is an impairment indication,  intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and goodwill acquired in
business combinations are tested annually for impairment. 
An impairment loss recognised in goodwill is not reversible.  With
respect to all other impaired assets,  an impairment loss recognised
in prior periods is reversed affecting the income statement if there
has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable
amount.  An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the
asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that
would have been determined (net of depreciation or amortisation) if
no impairment loss had been recognised. 

Assets/liabilities classified as held for sale	
Primarily non-current assets and liabilities expected to be recovered principally through sale rather than through continuing use are
classified as held for sale.  These are measured at the lower of their
carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.  A potential gain or
loss is offset against the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities
classified as held for sale.  Assets classified as held for sale are not
depreciated. 

Property,  plant and equipment
Property,  plant and equipment are measured at amortised cost.  This
comprises any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the
condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner
intended by Management less accumulated depreciation (except for
land and construction in progress) and accumulated impairment
losses.  Depreciation is recognised over the estimated useful life
utilising the 'straight-line method" and taking into account any potential residual value,  except where the 'declining-balance method" is
more appropriate in light of the actual utilisation pattern.  Parts of an
item of property,  plant and equipment with a cost that is significant in
relation to the total cost of the item are depreciated separately. 
Estimated useful lives are as follows:
Estimated useful lives of property,  plant and equipment   
Years 
Buildings and leasehold improvements 
Under finance lease arrangements,  the substantial risks and rewards
associated with an asset are transferred to the lessee.  At the beginning
of the lease arrangement,  the respective asset and a corresponding
liability are recognised at the fair value of the asset or,  if lower,  the
net present value of the minimum lease payments.  For subsequent
measurement,  minimum lease payments are apportioned between
the finance expense and the reduction of the outstanding liability.  The
finance expense is allocated to each period during the lease term so as
to produce a constant periodic interest rate on the remaining balance
of the liability.  In addition,  depreciation and any impairment losses for
the associated assets are recognised.  Depreciation is performed over
the lease term or,  if shorter,  over the useful life of the asset. 
Under operating lease agreements,  rent expenses are recognised
on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

Goodwill
Goodwill is an asset representing the future economic benefits arising
from assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognised.  This results when the
purchase cost exceeds the fair value of acquired identifiable assetsliabilities and contingent liabilities.  Goodwill arising from the acquisition of a foreign entity and any fair value adjustments to the carrying
amounts of assets,  liabilities and contingent liabilities of that foreign
entity are treated as assets,  liabilities and contingent liabilities of
the respective reporting entity,  and are translated at exchange rates
prevailing at the date of the initial consolidation.  Goodwill is carried in
the functional currency of the acquired foreign entity. 
Acquired goodwill is valued at cost and is tested for impairment
on an annual basis and additionally when there are indications of
potential impairment. 
On August 4,  2011,  the Group published the error findings of the
German Financial Reporting Enforcement Panel (FREP) regarding
the inconsistency between the designation of segments and of cashgenerating units on which the impairment test for goodwill is based. 
As a consequence,  the cash-generating units were redefined.  The
geographic regions responsible for the joint distribution of adidas
and Reebok were split into Wholesale and Retail for purposes of
impairment testing.  As a result of the redefinition of cash-generating
units,  the number of cash-generating units increased to 30 from 19including the other operating segments TaylorMade-adidas GolfRockport and Reebok-CCM Hockey. 
The cash-generating units (or groups of units) represent the
lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for
internal management purposes. 
The impairment test for goodwill has been performed based on
cash-generating units (or groups of units). 
Overall,  no impairment of goodwill resulted. 
The recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is determined
on the basis of value in use.  This calculation uses cash flow projections based on the financial planning covering a five-year period in
total.  The planning is based on the adidas Group's strategic business
plan 'Route 2015"   see Subsequent Events and Outlook,  p.  163 and reflects an
expected mid- to high-single-digit sales increase for the majority of
the cash-generating units (or groups of units).  For a few emerging
markets,  we expect,  on average,  a low-double-digit sales growth rate. 
Furthermore,  we expect the operating margin to improve,  primarily
driven by a slight improvement in the gross margin as well as lower
operating expenses as a percentage of sales.  The planning for capital
expenditure and working capital is primarily based on past experience. 
The planning for future tax payments is based on current statutory
corporate tax rates of the single cash-generating units (or groups of
units).  Cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated using steady
growth rates of 17% (2010: 17%).  According to our expectationsthese growth rates do not exceed the long-term average growth rate
of the business in which each cash-generating unit operates.

5 – 15

The adidas Group determined that there was no impairment necessary for any of its trademarks with indefinite useful lives in the years
ending December 31,  2011 and 2010. 
The recoverable amount is determined on the basis of fair value
less costs to sell (costs to sell are calculated with 1% of the fair value). 
The fair value is determined in discounting notional royalty savings
after tax and adding a tax amortisation benefit,  resulting from the
amortisation of the acquired asset ('relief-from-royalty method"). 
These calculations use projections of net sales related royalty savingsbased on financial planning which covers a period of five years in total. 
The level of the applied royalty rate for the determination of the royalty
savings is based on contractual agreements between the adidas Group
and external licensees as well as publicly available royalty rate agreements for similar assets.  Notional royalty savings beyond this period
are extrapolated using steady growth rates of 17% (2010: 17%).  The
growth rates do not exceed the long-term average growth rate of the
business to which the trademarks are allocated. 
The discount rate is based on a weighted average cost of capital
calculation derived using a five-year average market-weighted debt/
equity structure and financing costs referencing the Group's major
competitors.  The discount rate used is an after-tax rate and reflects
the specific equity and country risk.  The applied discount rate depends
on the respective intangible asset being valued and ranges between
65% and 81% (2010: between 64% and 83%). 
Expenditures during the development phase of internally
generated intangible assets are capitalised when they occur if they
qualify for recognition under IAS 38 'Intangible Assets".

Intangible assets are valued at amortised cost less accumulated amortisation (except for assets with indefinite useful lives) and impairment

Research and development
Research costs are expensed in full as incurred.  Development costs
are also expensed as incurred if they do not meet the recognition
criteria of IAS 38 'Intangible Assets". 
The Group spent € 115 million and € 102 million on product
research and development for the years ending December 31,  2011
and 2010,  respectively. 

Financial assets
All purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the
trade date.  Costs of purchases include transaction costs.  If the fair
value of available-for-sale financial assets (i, e.  non-derivative financial assets which are not allocable under another category of IAS 39)
can be measured reliably,  they are subsequently carried at fair value. 
Realised and unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the
fair value of financial assets are included in the income statement for
the period in which they arise,  except for available-for-sale financial
assets where unrealised gains and losses are recognised in equity
unless they are impaired. 

Borrowings and other liabilities 
The goodwill shown in the table under Wholesale,  Retail and Other Businesses is an aggregation of several cash-generating units.  The cashgenerating units with the highest goodwill of the respective segment
are Greater China (€ 162 million),  Central Europe (€ 155 million)Northern Europe (€ 134 million) and North America (€ 105 million)
within the Wholesale segment as well as CIS (€ 79 million),  North
America (€ 30 million) and Central Europe (€ 29 million) within the
Retail segment.  In the Other Businesses segment,  the most significant goodwill amount represents the TaylorMade-adidas Golf segment
goodwill in an amount of € 284 million. 

Borrowings and other liabilities are recognised at fair value using
the 'effective interest method",  net of transaction costs incurred.  In
subsequent periods,  long-term borrowings are stated at amortised
cost using the 'effective interest method".  Any difference between
proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the term of the borrowing. 

Other provisions and accrued liabilities	
Other provisions are recognised where a present obligation (legal or
constructive) to third parties has been incurred as a result of a past
event which can be estimated reliably and is likely to lead to an outflow
of resources,  and where the timing or amount is uncertain.  Other
non-current provisions are discounted if the effect of discounting is
material. 
Accrued liabilities are liabilities to pay for goods or services
that have been received or supplied but have not been paid,  invoiced
or formally agreed with the supplier,  including amounts due to
employees.  Here,  however,  the timing and amount of an outflow of
resources is not uncertain.

048   Notes 
Interest
Interest is recognised as income or expense as incurred using the
'effective interest method" with the exception of interest that is
directly attributable to the acquisition,  construction or production of
 qualifying asset.  This interest is capitalised as part of the cost of the
qualifying asset. 

Income taxes
Current income taxes are computed in accordance with the applicable taxation rules established in the countries in which the Group
operates. 
The Group computes deferred taxes for all temporary differences
between the carrying amount and the tax base of its assets and liabilities and tax loss carry-forwards.  As it is not permitted to recognise
 deferred tax liability for goodwill,  the Group does not compute any
deferred taxes thereon. 
Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences
and tax loss carry-forwards which exceed taxable temporary differences are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that the
company concerned will generate sufficient taxable income to realise
the associated benefit. 
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the
extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity,  in which
case it is recognised in equity. 

Recognition of revenues
Sales are recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or
receivable,  net of returns,  trade discounts and volume rebates,  when
the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods are transferred to the buyer,  and when it is probable that the economic benefits
associated with the transaction will flow to the Group. 
Royalty and commission income is recognised based on the
contract terms on an accrual basis. 

Advertising and promotional expenditures
Production costs for media campaigns are included in prepaid
expenses (other current and non-current assets) until the services are
received,  and upon receipt expensed in full.  Significant media buying
costs are expensed over the intended duration of the broadcast. 
Promotional expenses that involve payments,  including one-time
up-front payments for promotional contracts,  are expensed on a
straight-line basis over the term of the agreement. 

Estimation uncertainties and judgements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS
requires the use of assumptions and estimates that affect reported
amounts and related disclosures.  Although such estimates are based
on Management's best knowledge of current events and actionsactual results may ultimately differ from these estimates. 
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources
of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date which have a
signifi­ant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying

amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are
outlined in the respective Notes,  in particular goodwill   see Note 12 trademarks   see Note 13,  other provisions   see Note 19,  pensions   see
Note 23,  derivatives   see Note 28 as well as deferred taxes   see Note 33. 
Judgements have for instance been used in classifying leasing
arrangements as well as in determining valuation methods for intangible assets. 

  adidas Group 
2011 Annual Report

Provisions and expenses for pensions and similar obligations relate
to the Group's obligations for defined benefit and defined contribution
plans.  Obligations under defined benefit plans are determined separately for each plan by valuing the employee benefits accrued in return
for their service during the current and prior periods.  These benefit
accruals are discounted to determine their present value,  and the
fair value of any plan assets is deducted in order to determine the net
liability.  The discount rate is set on the basis of yields at the balance
sheet date for high-quality corporate bonds provided there is a deep
market for high-quality corporate bonds in a given currency.  Otherwise,  government bond yields are used as a reference.  Calculations
are performed by qualified actuaries using the 'projected unit credit
method" in accordance with IAS 19 'Employee Benefits".  Obligations
for contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as an
expense in the income statement as incurred. 
In addition to recognising actuarial gains and losses in the income
statement according to the 'corridor method",  IAS 19 grants the option
to immediately recognise actuarial gains and losses within equity. 
The Group utilises this option in order to avoid earnings volatility and
recognises actuarial gains or losses for defined benefit plans arising
during the financial year immediately in 'other reserves" within equityas shown in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

 cquisition/disposal of subsidiaries as
well as assets and liabilities 
The following valuation methods for the acquired assets were
applied:

Effective November 4,  2011,  adidas America Inc.  signed a share
purchase agreement to acquire Stone Age Equipment,  Inc.  ('Five
Ten") based in Redlands,  California (USA).  Five Ten is a company in the
outdoor action sports sector focusing on categories such as climbing
and mountain biking.  Through the acquisition of Five Ten,  the adidas
Group intends to improve its position in the outdoor category,  which
provides significant growth opportunities as articulated in the Group's
strategic business plan 'Route 2015".  The entire business of Five Ten
was purchased for a purchase price in the amount of US $ 25 million
in cash and contingent payments in an amount of US $ 13 million,  of
which US $ 3 million was paid up front.  The contingent payments are
dependent on Five Ten achieving certain performance measures over
the next three years. 
The acquisition had the following effect on the Group's assets and
liabilities,  based on a preliminary purchase price allocation:

– Other intangible assets: For the valuation of technologies and other
intangible assets,  the 'multi-period-excess-earnings method" was
used.  The respective future excess cash flows were identified and
adjusted in order to eliminate all elements not associated with these
assets.  Future cash flows were measured on the basis of the expected
sales by deducting variable and sales-related imputed costs for the
use of contributory assets.  Subsequently,  the outcome was discounted
using the appropriate discount rate and adding a tax amortisation
benefit. 
The excess of the acquisition cost paid versus the net of the amounts of
the fair values assigned to all assets acquired and liabilities assumedtaking into consideration the respective deferred taxes,  was recognised as goodwill.  Any acquired asset that did not meet the identification and recognition criteria for an asset was included in the amount
recognised as goodwill. 
The goodwill arising on this acquisition was allocated to those
cash-generating units operating in the outdoor product segment at
the time of the acquisition.  The goodwill is denominated in the local
functional currency   see Note 02. 
If this acquisition had occurred on January 1,  2011,  total Group net
sales would have been € 134 billion and net income would have been
€ 670 million for the year ending December 31,  2011. 
The acquired subsidiary contributed net losses of € 0 million to
the Group's net income for the period from November to December
2011.

Trademarks 
The majority of goodwill which primarily relates to the acquisition of
the Reebok business in 2006 is denominated in US dollars.  A currency
translation effect of € 30 million and € 61 million was recorded for the
years ending December 31,  2011 and 2010,  respectively. 
The Group determines whether goodwill impairment is necessary
at least on an annual basis.  This requires an estimation of the value
in use of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill is allocated. 
Estimating the value in use requires the Group to make an estimate
of the expected future cash flows from the cash-generating units
and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the
present value of those cash flows.  There was no need for impairment
for the years ending December 31,  2011 and 2010. 
Future changes in expected cash flows and discount rates may
lead to impairments of the accounted goodwill in the future.  For
details see Attachment I to the consolidated financial statements 
 see Statement of Movements of Intangible and Tangible Assets,  p.  216.

Trademarks and other intangible assets 
At December 31,  2011,  trademarks,  mainly related to the acquisition
of Reebok International Ltd.  (USA) in 2006 and Ashworth,  Inc.  in 2008have indefinite useful lives.  This is due to the expectation of permanent use of the acquired brand names. 
The Group tests at least on an annual basis whether trademarks
with indefinite useful lives are impaired.  This requires an estimation
of the fair value less costs to sell of the trademarks.  As part of this
estimation,  the Group is required to make an estimate of the expected
future trademark-specific sales and appropriate arm's length notional
royalty rates from the cash-generating unit and also to choose a
suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those
cash flows.  There was no need for impairment for the years ending
December 31,  2011 and 2010. 
Future changes in expected cash flows and discount rates may
lead to impairments of the accounted trademarks in the future. 
Amortisation expenses for intangible assets with definite
useful lives were € 48 million and € 55 million for the years ending
December 31,  2011 and 2010,  respectively   see Note 30.  Impairment
losses amounted to € 0 million and € 11 million for the years ending
December 31,  2011 and 2010,  respectively   see Note 30.  These are
related to distribution and licensing rights,  for which no future
economic benefit exists.

Long-term financial assets 
16

Long-term financial assets include a 91% investment in FC Bayern
München AG (2010: 97%) of € 79 million (2010: € 79 million).  The
percentage share held in the investment has decreased due to the
issuance of new shares which have been bought by another shareholder.  This investment is classified as 'fair value through profit or
loss" and recorded at fair value.  This equity security does not have a
quoted market price in an active market.  Therefore,  existing contractual settlements were used in order to calculate the fair value as
at December 31,  2011.  Dividends are distributed by FC Bayern
München AG instead of regular interest payments. 
Additionally,  long-term financial assets include investments
which are mainly invested in insurance products and are measured at
fair value,  as well as other financial assets.

 orrowings and credit lines 
Borrowings are denominated in a variety of currencies in which the
Group conducts its business.  The largest portions of effective gross
borrowings (before liquidity swaps for cash management purposes)
as at December 31,  2011 are denominated in euros (2011: 56%; 2010:
55%) and US dollars (2011: 35%; 2010: 40%). 
The weighted average interest rate on the Group's gross
borrowings decreased to 49% in 2011 (2010: 51%). 
As at December 31,  2011,  the Group had cash credit lines and
other long-term financing arrangements totalling € 52 billion (2010:
€ 55 billion); thereof unused credit lines accounted for € 39 billion
(2010: € 39 billion).  In addition,  the Group had separate lines for the
issuance of letters of credit and guarantees in an amount of approximately € 02 billion (2010: € 03 billion). 
The Group's outstanding financings are unsecured and may include
standard financial covenants,  which are reviewed on a quarterly basis. 
These covenants may include limits on the disposal of fixed assets,  the
maximum amount of debt secured by liens,  cross default provisions
and change of control.  In addition,  certain financial arrangements
contain equity ratio covenants,  minimum equity covenants as well as
net loss covenants. 
As at December 31,  2011,  and December 31,  2010,  actual shareholders' equity was well above the amount of the minimum equity
covenant.  Likewise,  the relevant amount of net income clearly
exceeded net loss covenants.

Marketing provisions mainly consist of provisions for promotion
contracts. 
Provisions for employee benefits mainly consist of provisions
for short- and long-term variable compensation components.  With
regard to provisions for early retirement,  claims for reimbursement in
an amount of € 1 million (December 31,  2010: € 2 million) are shown
under other non-current assets. 
Provisions for returns,  allowances and warranty primarily arise
due to bonus agreements with customers and the obligation of
fulfilling customer claims with regard to the return of faulty products 
sold by the Group.  The amount of the provision follows the historical
development of returns,  allowances and warranty as well as current
agreements. 
Provisions for taxes other than income taxes mainly relate to value
added tax,  real estate tax and motor vehicle tax. 
Sundry provisions mainly include provisions for customs risks as
well as anticipated losses from purchases and other transactions,  and
contingent losses from pending lawsuits. 
Management follows past experience from similar transactions
when estimating the amounts recognised as other provisions while
considering all evidence from events until the preparation of the
consolidated financial statements.

Given the diverse Group structure,  different defined benefit plans
exist,  comprising a variety of post-employment benefit arrangements. 
The benefit plans generally provide payments in case of death,  disability or retirement to former employees and their survivors.  The obligations arising from defined benefit plans are partly covered by plan
assets.  In 2011,  the defined benefit plan offered at one of the Japanese
subsidiaries of adidas AG was converted into a defined contribution
plan,  resulting in a plan settlement.

Present value of the defined benefit obligation  (€ in millions)
2011

The actuarial assumptions as at the balance sheet date are used to
determine the defined benefit liability at that date and the pension
expense for the upcoming financial year. 
The actuarial assumptions for withdrawal and mortality rates are
based on statistical information available in the various countries,  the
latter for Germany on the Heubeck 2005 G mortality tables. 
The Group recognises actuarial gains or losses arising in defined
benefit plans during the financial year immediately outside the income
statement in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
The actuarial losses recognised in this statement for 2011 amount to
€ 13 million (2010: € 13 million).  The accumulated actuarial losses
recognised amount to € 51 million (2010: € 38 million). 
The expected return on plan assets assumption is set separately
for the various benefit plans.  Around 90% of the plan assets are
related to plan assets in the UK,  Germany and Switzerland.  The
overall expected rate of return on assets is derived by aggregating the
expected rate of return for each asset class over the underlying asset
allocation.  Historical markets are studied and expected returns are
based on widely accepted capital market principles. 
In the UK,  the assumed long-term rate of return on each asset
class is assumed to be in line with long-term government bonds,  with
an additional investment return of 35% for equity securities and 10%
for corporate bonds. 
In Germany,  the plan assets are invested in insurance contracts
and in a pension fund,  and the expected return on assets is set equal
to the expected return on the underlying insurance contracts. 
The plan assets in Switzerland are held by a pension foundation
and the expected rate of return is calculated as a weighted average
per asset class,  based on the investment strategy and the expected
return on the varying asset categories.

The asset ceiling effect arises from the German funded defined benefit
plan and is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
The determination of assets and liabilities for defined benefit
plans is based upon statistical and actuarial valuations.  In particularthe present value of the defined benefit obligation is driven by financial
variables (such as the discount rates or future increases in salaries)
and demographic variables (such as mortality and employee turnover). 
The actuarial assumptions may differ significantly from the actual
results,  i, e.  the present value of the actual future performance may
differ from the reported present value.

 hareholders' equity 
The nominal capital of adidas AG ('the company") has remained
unchanged since December 31,  2010.  As at the balance sheet dateand in the period beyond,  up to and including February 15,  2012,  it
amounted to € 209216186 divided into 209216186 registered
no-par-value shares ('registered shares") and is fully paid in. 
Each share grants one vote and is entitled to dividends starting
from the beginning of the year it was issued.  Treasury shares held
directly or indirectly are not entitled to dividend payment in accordance
with § 71b German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz AktG). 
Neither at the balance sheet date nor at February 15,  2012 does the
company hold any treasury shares. 

Authorised Capital
The Executive Board of adidas AG did not make use of the existing
amounts of authorised capital of up to € 95000000 in the 2011 financial year or in the period beyond the balance sheet date up to and
including February 15,  2012.  The following description of the existing
authorised capital does not contain the cancellation of the Authorised
Capital 2009/II,  resolved by the Annual General Meeting on May 122011,  which had also not been made use of up to May 12,  2011.

Capital management
The Group's policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to
uphold investor,  creditor and market confidence and to sustain future
develop­ ent of the business. 

The Group seeks to maintain a balance between a higher return
on equity that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings and
the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position.  The
Group further aims to maintain net debt below two times EBITDA over
the long term. 
Financial leverage is derived by dividing net borrowings (shortand long-term borrowings less cash and cash equivalents as well as
short-term financial assets) in an amount of negative € 90 million (2010:
€ 221 million) by shareholders' equity in an amount of € 5327 billion
(2010: € 4616 billion).  EBITDA amounted to € 1257 billion for the
financial year ending December 31,  2011 (2010: € 1159 billion).  The
ratio between net borrowings and EBITDA amounted to negative 01
for the financial year ending December 31,  2011 (2010: 02). 

Reserves
Reserves within shareholders' equity are as follows:
– Capital reserve: comprises the paid premium for the issuance of
share capital. 
– Cumulative translation adjustments: comprises all foreign currency
differences arising from the translation of the financial statements
of foreign operations. 

– Hedging reserve: comprises the effective portion of the cumulative
net change in the fair value of cash flow hedges related to hedged
transactions that have not yet occurred as well as of hedges of net
investments in foreign subsidiaries. 
– Other reserves: comprise the cumulative net change of actuarial
gains or losses and the asset ceiling effect regarding defined benefit
plans,  expenses recognised for share option plans as well as fair
values of available-for-sale financial assets. 
– Retained earnings: comprise the accumulated profits less dividends
paid. 

Distributable profits and dividends
Distributable profits to shareholders are determined by reference
to the retained earnings of adidas AG and calculated under German
Commercial Law. 
Based on the resolution of the 2011 Annual General Meeting,  the
dividend for 2010 was € 080 per share (total amount: € 167 million). 
The Executive Board of adidas AG will propose to shareholders a
dividend payment of € 100 per dividend-entitled share for the year
2011 to be made from retained earnings of € 312 million reported as at
December 31,  2011.  The subsequent remaining amount will be carried
forward. 
209216186 dividend-entitled shares exist as at December 312011,  which would lead to a dividend payment of € 209 million.

1)  his category relates to a 91% investment in FC Bayern München AG of € 79 million. 

Dividends are distributed by FC Bayern München AG instead of regular interest payments. 

Level 1 is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
Level 2 is based on inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,  either directly (i, e.  as prices) or indirectly (i, e.  derived from prices). 
Level 3 is based on inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). 

Due to the short-term maturities of cash and cash equivalents,  shortterm financial assets,  accounts receivable and payable as well as
other current financial receivables and payables,  their respective fair
values approximate their carrying amount. 
The fair values of non-current financial assets and liabilities are
estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using current
interest rates for debt of similar terms and remaining maturities,  and
adjusted by an adidas Group specific credit risk premium. 
Fair values of long-term financial assets classified as availablefor-sale are based on quoted market prices in an active market or are
calculated as present values of expected future cash flows. 
The fair values of forward contracts and currency options are
determined on the basis of market conditions at the balance sheet
date.  The fair value of a currency option is determined using generally
accepted models to calculate option prices,  such as the 'GarmanKohlhagen-model".  The fair market value of an option is influenced
not only by the remaining term of the option,  but also by other determining factors such as the actual foreign exchange rate and the
volatility of the underlying foreign currency base.

foreign exchange risk.  As at December 31,  2011,  the Group had
outstanding currency options with premiums paid totalling an amount
of € 5 million (December 31,  2010: € 7 million).  The effective part of
the currency hedges is directly recognised in hedging reserves and as
part of the acquisition costs of inventories,  respectively,  and posted
into the income statement at the same time as the underlying secured
transaction is recorded.  An amount of € 17 million (2010: € 16 million)
for currency options and an amount of € 101 million (2010: negative
€ 25 million) for forward contracts were recorded in hedging reserves. 
Currency option premiums impacted net income in the amount of
€ 6 million in 2011 (2010: € 4 million). 
The total time value of the currency options not being part of a
hedge in an amount of € 2 million (2010: € 1 million) was recorded in
the income statement in 2011.  Due to a change in the exposure,  some
of the currency hedges were terminated and consequently an amount
of € 2 million was reclassified from hedging reserves to the income
statement. 
In the years ending December 31,  2011 and 2010,  hedging instruments related to product sourcing were bought to hedge a total net
amount of US $ 48 billion and US $ 37 billion,  respectively. 
The notional amounts of all outstanding currency hedging instruments,  which are mainly related to cash flow hedges,  are summarised
in the following table:

 total net fair value of € 115 million (2010: negative € 35 million) for
forward contracts related to hedging instruments falling under hedge
accounting as per definition of IAS 39 'Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement" was recorded in the hedging reserve.  The
remaining net fair value of € 10 million (2010: negative €11 million)
mainly related to liquidity swaps for cash management purposes
and to forward contracts hedging intercompany dividend receivables
­
and was recorded in the income statement.  The total fair value of
€ 28 million (2010: € 23 million) for outstanding currency options
related to cash flow hedges. 
The fair value adjustments of outstanding cash flow hedges
for forecasted sales is reported in the income statement when the
forecasted sales transactions are recorded.  The vast majority of these
transactions are forecasted to occur in 2012.  As at December 312011,  inventories were adjusted by negative € 5 million (2010: positive
€ 6 million) which will be recognised in the income statement in 2012. 
In the hedging reserve,  an amount of negative € 8 million (2010:
negative € 3 million) is included for hedges of net investments in
foreign entities.  This reserve will remain until the investment in the
foreign entity has been sold or the loan has been paid back. 

The comparatively high amount of forward contracts is primarily due
to currency swaps for liquidity management purposes and hedging
transactions.

In order to determine the fair values of its derivatives that are not
publicly traded,  the adidas Group uses generally accepted quantitative
financial models based on market conditions prevailing at the balance
sheet date. 
In 2011,  the fair values of the derivatives were determined applying
the 'par method",  which uses actively traded forward rates.  In 2010the 'zero method" was applied,  which is a theoretical model for the
determination of forward rates based on deposit and swap interest
rates.

The above-mentioned interest rate swaps in the nominal amount of
€ 105 million (2010: € 150 million) are classified as cash flow hedges
pursuant to IAS 39.  The goal of these hedges is to protect future cash
flows arising from private placements with variable interest rates by
generating synthetic fixed interest rate financing.  These interest rate
swaps classified as cash flow hedges had a positive fair value in the
amount of € 0 million (2010: € 0 million) and a negative fair value of
€ 4 million (2010: negative € 6 million).  The negative fair value change
of € 0 million (2010: negative € 2 million) for interest rate swaps which
were classified as cash flow hedges was booked in hedging reserves. 
The amount that was reclassified from equity to the income statement
for the period was negative € 3 million (2010: negative € 4 million). 
Interest rate swaps classified as cash flow hedges in a nominal
amount of € 105 million secure variable interest payments arising
from private placements with maturities in 2012. 
The above summary for 2010 includes an interest rate swap in
the amount of € 75 million which is classified as a fair value hedge
pursuant to IAS 39.  The aim of this US dollar interest rate swap was to
obtain variable financing for a private placement in US dollars.  The US
dollar interest rate swap was closed in 2011 and the resulting income
in the amount of € 7 million is amortised to the income statement over
the maturity of the private placement. 

In 2011,  sundry income partly relates to income from insurance
compensations. 
In 2010,  sundry income partly relates to the positive settlement of
 lawsuit.  In 2010,  gains from disposal of fixed assets include income
from the divestiture of a trademark.

and development,  as well as for logistics and central administration. 
In addition,  they include impairment losses as well as depreciation on

Deferred tax assets and liabilities 
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the realisation of the related benefit is probable.  For the assessment of

­ robability,  in addition to past performance and the respective prospects for the foreseeable future,  appropriate tax structuring measures
are also taken into consideration. 
Deferred tax assets for which the realisation of the related tax
benefits is not probable increased on a currency-neutral basis from
€ 325 million to € 328 million for the year ending December 31,  2011. 
These amounts mainly relate to tax losses carried forward and unused
foreign tax credits of the US tax group.  The remaining unrecognised
deferred tax assets relate to subsidiaries operating in markets where
the realisation of the related tax benefit is not considered probable. 
The Group does not recognise deferred tax liabilities for unremitted
earnings of non-German subsidiaries to the extent that they are
expected to be permanently invested in international operations.  These
earnings,  the amount of which cannot be ­ racticably computed,  could

become subject to additional tax if they were remitted as dividends or
if the Group were to sell its shareholdings in the subsidiaries.

 egmental information 
The Group operates predominantly in one industry segment the
design,  distribution and marketing of athletic and sports lifestyle
products. 
Following the Group's internal management reporting and in
accordance with the definition of IFRS 8 'Operating Segments"six operating segments have been identified: Wholesale,  RetailTaylorMade-adidas Golf,  Rockport,  Reebok-CCM Hockey and Other
Centrally Managed Brands.  According to the criteria of IFRS 8 for
reportable segments,  the business segments Wholesale and Retail
are reported separately,  while the remaining are aggregated under
Other Businesses due to their only subordinate materiality. 
The adidas and Reebok brands are reported under the segments
Wholesale,  Retail and Other Centrally Managed Brands. 
The operating segment TaylorMade-adidas Golf contains the
brands TaylorMade,  adidas Golf and Ashworth. 
Certain centralised Group functions do not meet the definition of
IFRS 8 for a reportable operating segment.  This includes functions
such as central treasury,  global sourcing as well as other headquarter
departments.  Assets,  liabilities,  income and expenses relating to these
corporate functions are presented together with other non-allocable
items and intersegment eliminations in the reconciliations. 
The chief operating decision maker for the adidas Group has been
defined as the joint Executive Board of adidas AG. 
Information about the Group's segments,  in accordance with
Management's internal reporting structure,  is outlined below. 
There are no intersegment sales between the reportable
segments.  Accounting policies applied for reporting segmental information are the same as those used for the adidas Group   see note 02. 
The results of the operating segments are reported in the line item
"Segmental operating profit".  This is defined as gross profit minus
costs directly attributable to the segment or the group of segments
(primarily sales and logistics costs) before marketing working budget
expenditures and operating overhead costs not directly attributable. 
Segmental assets include accounts receivable and inventories. 
Only these items are reported to the chief operating decision maker
on a regular basis.  Depreciation,  amortisation,  impairment losses
and reversals of impairment losses as well as capital expenditures
for tangible and intangible assets are part of the segmental reportingeven though segmental assets do not contain tangible and intangible assets.  Depreciation and amortisation as well as impairment
losses and reversals of impairment losses not directly attributable to
 segment or a group of segments are presented under HQ/Consolidation in the reconciliations.
