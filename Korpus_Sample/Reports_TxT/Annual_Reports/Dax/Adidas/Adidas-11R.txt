  'Hi,  my name is Andrew and,  as a passionate runner,  I couldn't be in a better position than as part of the
adidas Running team.  Innovation for the runner is at the heart of everything we do,  and we relentlessly
strive to find new technologies,  materials and products that help them be better and run faster.  Our
industry-changing innovation,  the Energy Boost running shoe,  is now one year old.  As you would expect
from us,  we literally and figuratively never stand still.  Our big ambition is to bring our energy technology
ultimately to all of our running shoes above € 100.  We have just rolled out our new Supernova Glide
Boost.  This new shoe enhances the elements that Supernova consumers already love and takes the shoe
series to the next level with the revolutionary Boost cushioning technology,  which provides the highest
energy return in the running industry.  Only the best will do for our runners.  Boost your run!"

  'Hi,  I am Matthias and I have the privilege of being part of the adidas Football team who brought
the official match ball for the 2014 FIFA World Cup,  the Brazuca,  to life.  adidas is football and this
summer our iconic match ball once again will be at the heart of the planet's biggest sporting event. 
The name was picked by Brazilian fans through a huge social media activation and refers to their
national pride and their passion for football full of emotion and goodwill to all.  Brazuca's uniquehigh-­ recision and revolutionary construction is considered to be a geometrical wonder,  with six

identical panels which eliminate almost all sources of imperfection.  It is also the most-tested ball
that adidas has ever created and was played by over 600 footballers,  such as Lionel Messi and
Zinedine Zidane,  as well as used 'undercover' at official tournaments such as the FIFA U-20 World
Cup,  all before its official launch.  We are football.  We are ready. "

  'Hi,  I am Jaewon,  part of the adidas Originals design team.  I am pretty sure that I share
 common passion with you: the Stan Smith.  I think that this sneaker is one of the
all-time greatest.  These iconic shoes mean a lot of different things to a lot of different
people,  from sneakerheads to style setters.  I have had the privilege to become a part
of Stan Smith's history by evolving this sneaker into a wedge shoe for women.  We knew
that we had to be very careful with our adjustments and changes,  to make sure we
keep the strong and timeless recipe of the original classic untouched.  This is how the
Stan Smith Up was born.  I am very proud of this outcome and the way Stan Smith Up is
writing a new chapter in the 40-year heritage of this timeless shoe.  Evolving originality
with respect to our past. "

  'Hi,  my name is Matt and I am part of the Reebok Running Footwear product development team.  It's
 dream come true to get the opportunity to completely redefine the footwear for a sport.  The Spartan
Race partnership gave us this unique chance! Our objective was clear to build a shoe that would
conquer any difficulty in a Spartan Race and ultimately improve the performance of the athletes.  To gain
 clear understanding of the footwear needs for Spartan Races,  our product team first met with several
elite Spartan athletes.  We then decided to get a feeling for the challenges first-hand by competing in a
Spartan Race ourselves! The lessons learned from this great experience drove us to incorporate stateof-the-art technology that actively pumps water out of the Spartan shoes.  This is just one of the many
solutions we created and so I am incredibly proud to present the only shoe on the market that can truly
conquer any obstacle: the Reebok All Terrain Series. "

'Hi,  my name is Claire,  and almost every week one of my great joys is receiving love letters
from our NEO lovers.  Of course,  it's not me who is addressed in those letters,  it is NEO. 
These are spontaneous letters from teenagers who want to share their 'NEO love' with
us.  I have never seen anything like it,  it is truly amazing.  But what is the magic behind
this love? It's a simple formula,  it's giving our teens direct access to the label and handing
control over to them,  such as our NEO Runway event in New York,  where we let NEO
teens curate the looks that walked the catwalk.  No other brand acts in this way.  This is
what sets us apart from our competition.  NEO offers teens the desirable products and
experiences they want and can afford to buy.  This love story has only just started. "

Herbert Hainer
adidas Group CEO

In 2013,  the adidas Group delivered solid financial results despite several external and internal
challenges.  In particular,  the depreciation of several currencies versus the euro resulted in significant
currency translation negatives for the year.  Nevertheless,  the Group's commitment to increase
consumer desire for its brands through innovation and marketing excellence was again visible in
several key categories and markets.  This enabled the Group to deliver further progress towards its
long-term sustainable margin objectives,  which resulted in record earnings per share,  excluding
goodwill impairment losses,  of € 401.  As a result of this and the Group's strong balance sheetManagement is proposing a dividend to shareholders of € 150 per share,  reiterating its commitment to
steadily increase shareholder returns over time. 
Looking out to 2014,  while the Group will again face significant translation and margin challenges due
to currency declines,  from an operational perspective,  Management is confident of strong underlying
growth momentum compared to 2013.  This will be fuelled in particular by the 2014 FIFA World Cup in
Brazil and the further roll-out of highly innovative technologies such as Boost. 
In the following letter,  adidas Group CEO Herbert Hainer reflects on 2013,  clarifies the impacts from
currencies and one-off items and discusses the Group's strategic and financial outlook for 2014.

To Our Shareholders
Letter from the CEO

In a marathon,  every inch of every mile counts.  In this spirit,  I am pleased to report that our Group
finished 2013 strongly.  Towards year-end,  we regained the kind of growth momentum more typical of our
high-performance standards.  We delivered an exceptional fourth quarter result,  with robust currency-neutral
sales growth of 12% and operating profit excluding goodwill impairment losses increasing almost fourfold
compared to the prior year.  That's a new fourth quarter record for our Group.  This is a clear testament to
the persistence and energy we have exercised in making the most out of a challenging year in several areas
for the adidas Group.  And this strong finish puts the Group in a great position as we begin an exciting 2014
for our brands and for our Group. 
Before I come to that,  looking back over the past twelve months,  my review of the year shows a mixed but
overall positive picture. 
The key developments of the year from a financial perspective were as follows:

/ 
Operating margin excluding goodwill impairment losses increased 70 basis points to 87%. 
/  income attributable to shareholders excluding goodwill impairment losses increased 6% to
Net
€ 839 million. 
/ 
Operating working capital as a percentage of sales increased 90 basis points to 209%. 
/ 
Equity ratio expanded 2 percentage points to 473%. 
/  cash at year-end amounted to € 295 million. 
Net
On the one hand,  my senior management team and I were disappointed that we had to negatively adjust
our initial guidance for the year in September.  With a Group of our size,  every year has its challenges,  that's
business life and we plan for that.  Over the course of the year,  however,  considerable negative currency
developments versus the euro,  distribution constraints in Russia/CIS as well as a stalling global golf
market put additional pressure on our financial results.  I discussed the latter two of these three issues in
detail in my letter on the first nine months results.  And while they impacted us significantly in terms of our
profitability and top-line achievements,  in the end,  the devaluation of major currencies versus the euro was
simply the factor that was too significant in magnitude to cover operationally.  And there were many,  such
as the Russian rouble,  Japanese yen,  Argentine peso,  Brazilian real,  Turkish lira,  Australian dollar and
Canadian dollar.  Accumulated for the twelve months,  currencies alone wiped out more than € 750 million
from our top-line result.  Unfortunately,  these uncontrollable and unavoidable negative effects will continue
in 2014,  and I will come back to that later,  given its significance to our financial statements.

On the other hand,  we shouldn't ignore our many successes in 2013.  These definitely outweigh the negativesas they derive from key wins in strategic categories and growth markets.  This is all the more importantas winning in these areas fulfils a key deliverable of our Route 2015 strategy to drive quality growth
and sustainable success for our Group by fuelling consumer desire with premium products and brand
experiences. 
Let me share with you a few examples:

fans around the globe with our colourful and unexpected Samba collection,  including a new boot from
each of adidas' four boot ranges,  adizero f50,  Predator,  Nitrocharge and 11Pro. 
/  our strategically important and youngest sub-brand adidas NEO,  we continued to make solid progress
For
deepening our relationship to the teenage lifestyle consumer.  Sales increased 14% currency-neutral
in 2013,  with the label now generating almost € 700 million in sales.  With a four-year compound annual

At

/  promised,  we returned to growth with the Reebok brand in 2013,  with sales increasing 2% currencyAs
neutral.  Excluding the NFL licence impact that still burdened the first quarter,  sales increased 4%
currency-neutral.  Add to that the tremendous increase in gross margin of 40 percentage points to 397%we are now in touching distance of our Route 2015 goal to lift the brand margin above 40%. 
/ 
Finally,  despite the challenging golf market,  TaylorMade-adidas Golf continues to be the undisputed
number one in metalwoods and irons.  While it was a tough year overall,  we continued to extend our
market share lead in irons across the globe and also gained good market share in footwear,  where sales
were up a healthy 16% currency-neutral. 
Additionally,  from a regional perspective,  we again led from the front in key emerging markets such as Latin
America and Greater China,  which grew 19% and 7% currency-neutral,  respectively.  In Latin America,  which
will have a lot of attention in 2014,  this was of course fuelled by the rising anticipation and excitement ahead
of the World Cup in Brazil.  But it also reflects our continuous investments and improvements in this vibrant
part of the world.  In China,  we continued to hold both our major competitor and the local brands at bay.  Sales
increased to over € 16 billion.  Our management team there continues to execute with excellence,  blending
the appeal and attractiveness of adidas,  with a deep understanding of the Chinese consumer.  All research
confirms that we are one of the hottest brands in China right now,  with a fantastic brand footprint,  being in
over 7600 stores in more than 1000 cities.

To Our Shareholders

/

In other regions,  our development in 2013 was more mixed.  In Western Europe,  where sales declined
6% currency-neutral,  we faced particular headwinds from high prior year comparisons related to major
sports events.  North America also developed lower than our expectations,  as some lifestyle trends moved
against us and we suffered from lower growth in basketball footwear due to the injury of our star athlete
Derrick Rose.  In both of these regions,  I am confident that our performance will pick up in 2014,  as we
have worked hard on our offerings for these important regions.  But we have also introduced a number of
new organisational initiatives to help us become faster and better in these regions.  In order to continue
to lead the game on our home turf,  we implemented one aligned strategy for Western Europe,  creating a
new market structure.  I am convinced that our new and more coordinated set-up will make us even more
attractive for consumers and customers and will enable us to further extend our leadership position in this
important region.  In North America,  we have united adidas and Reebok under one management team to
maximise the potential of both brands in that region.

Additionally,  at the Board level,  we are also conscious about preparing for the future.  I have always
highlighted that our Group has a wide range of international talents and we are committed to giving our
next generation of leaders more responsibility.  Following the appointment of Roland Auschel,  who assumed
responsibility for Global Sales on a Board level last October,  I am very pleased to welcome Eric Liedtke to the
Executive Board,  who will succeed Erich Stamminger,  responsible for Global Brands.  Over the past yearsEric Liedtke has contributed to the extremely positive development of the adidas brand.  We are convinced
that he will lead our brands into the next era of desirability,  success and growth.  At the same time,  on behalf
of the adidas Group,  I would like to thank Erich Stamminger for his leadership and expertise and the many
contributions he has made to the success of the Group and its brands in the last three decades. 
Turning to the future: the passion,  the inspiration and the drive for success our employees have shown in
delivering results underpin our common desire to build the leading sporting goods company in the world. 
And 2014 will be no different. 
Be it products,  be it campaigns,  be it imagination,  we have everything we need to be successful.  And we will
do it with determination,  speed and leadership.

As you know,  in 2010 we created our strategic business plan Route 2015.  The centrepiece of the plan is to
prepare and,  in many respects,  to transform the Group for long-term sustainable growth and success.  Nowjust after the half-way point of our journey,  it's time to reflect and refine our focus.  After three years,  while
 am satisfied that we are well on track operationally,  unfortunately the environment has served up more
challenges than we had anticipated.  Be it input cost pressures,  a persistently weaker European market
environment or,  most significantly,  adverse currency movements.  And to be fair and frank,  we have also
made a few executional mistakes. 
However,  the most important thing about a high-quality management team is that they know how to tackle
challenges and believe me,  we have all the insight,  character and determination to do so.  Excluding
currencies,  I am convinced that we will achieve most,  if not all of the operational targets we set ourselves
for Route 2015.  Nevertheless,  the currency situation,  as it is right now,  represents a significant risk to the
achievement of our goals.  This is already reflected in our financial guidance for 2014,  where we expect
another year of significant currency translation negatives.  Right now,  the order of magnitude could be as
much as we saw in 2013,  i, e.  a mid-single-digit percentage point negative just from translation.  On top of
that,  we will see additional gross margin pressures given the sharp weakening of currencies such as the
Argentine peso and the Russian rouble already so early in 2014.  This is because these markets have open
exposures against the US dollar,  related to our US dollar sourcing costs,  which in these markets are too
expensive to hedge.  We have reflected this situation in our 2014 guidance range for net income attributable
to shareholders of € 830 million to € 930 million. 
So,  what does that mean for our 2015 targets? As we start our approach and final ascent to the top of the
mountain,  currency headwinds will make our climb to the summit more challenging than we thought when
setting out from base camp.  But let me assure you we have the right equipment,  the best know-how and the
most talented people to complete this climb,  and the endurance to get there,  even if it does take us a little
longer to achieve every goal outlined in the plan.

The next two years will nonetheless be our most successful ever.  We will drive high-single-digit currencyneutral growth in line with our plan.  In euro terms,  we will grow our bottom line at a much faster rate than

achieve a double-digit compound annual earnings growth rate over the Route 2015 period.  That,  in my viewis an exceptional return given the difficult and uncertain global economic environment. 
If there is one message I want you to take from this letter,  it is this: we are a growth company.  In 2014,  we will
grow in all markets,  all channels and all brands,  and we will do so again in 2015.  I am proud we have been
able to share a lot of success together with you,  dear shareholders,  on our Route 2015 journey so far.  To datewe have already generated a 14% compound annual earnings growth rate.  You have shown your confidence
in us and our Group's potential,  which is clearly reflected in our strong share price development.  In 2013our share price rose 38% and again outperformed the DAX-30,  which gained 25% in the same period.  With
 market capitalisation of € 19 billion,  adidas AG has never been as valuable as at year-end 2013.  And as
 result of our strong balance sheet,  we are pleased to continue our progress on improving our payout ratio
from 357% to 374% (excluding goodwill impairment losses),  representing a dividend per share of € 150.

But we are a high-performance company and we want to achieve more,  for ourselves and for you.  We have
 proven track record and can deliver the big results when it counts.  Be assured,  we are ready,  willing and
able to do this again as is clearly visible in our strong fourth quarter momentum.  We will make sure we do
what is right for the long-term success of our Group.  We will make bold decisions and pursue our goals with
determination and focus.  While currencies will interfere with our financial results,  they will not deter our
willpower to follow the vision of the Group to be the leading sporting goods company in the world.  We are
here for the love of sport.  This is our passion.  And we will continue to work in a way that makes us proud of
the result.  I am convinced that we have everything in place to reach new heights,  break records and drive
long-term sustainable value.

Supervisory Board Report

Chairman of the Supervisory Board 
Dear Shareholders20

We look back on 2013 as a challenging but also successful year.  Thanks to strong brands and partnerships in
the world of sports,  as well as first-class innovations,  the adidas Group was again able to achieve good overall
business results.  Growth in the emerging markets as well as the strong gross margin improvement were key
highlights.  However,  the Group also faced significant headwinds in 2013.  The significant negative currency
translation effects,  a weak development in Western Europe,  generally lower demand in the golf market as well
as distribution issues in Russia/CIS were particular challenges.  Nevertheless,  these issues have been proactively
and resolutely managed,  and the Group is well positioned to again achieve sales growth at all brands,  in all
regions and in all markets as well as to improve profitability in 2014. 

Supervision and advice in dialogue with the Executive Board
In the year under review,  we again performed all our tasks laid down by law,  the Articles of Association and the
Rules of Procedure carefully and conscientiously.  We regularly advised the Executive Board on the management
of the company and diligently and continuously supervised its management activities,  assuring ourselves of the
legality,  expediency and regularity thereof. 
The Executive Board involved us directly in all of the Group's fundamental decisions.  After in-depth consultation
and examination of the detailed information submitted to us by the Executive Board,  we approved individual
transactions where required by law. 
The Executive Board informed us extensively and in a timely manner through written and oral reports at our
Supervisory Board meetings.  This information covered all relevant aspects of the Group's business strategy and
business planning,  including finance,  investment and personnel planning,  the course of business and the Group's
financial position and profitability.  We were also kept up to date on matters relating to the risk situation,  risk
management and compliance as well as all major decisions and business transactions. 
The Executive Board explained immediately and in a detailed manner any deviations in business performance
from the established plans,  and we discussed these matters in depth within the Supervisory Board. 

adidas Group   /  2013 Annual Report 
To Our Shareholders
Supervisory Board Report 
/ 017 
/

The Executive Board regularly provided us with detailed reports for the preparation of our meetings.  We thus
always had the opportunity to critically analyse the Executive Board's reports and resolution proposals within
the committees and within the Supervisory Board as a whole and to put forward any suggestions we might have
before resolving upon the Executive Board's proposals after in-depth examination and consultation.  In the periods
between our meetings,  the Executive Board kept us continuously informed about the current business situation
by means of monthly reports. 
In addition to five regular meetings of the Supervisory Board,  we held two extraordinary meetings in the year under
review.  In January 2014,  an extraordinary Supervisory Board meeting relating to Executive Board matters took
place by way of a conference call.  Two of the shareholder representatives were unable to participate in person due
to the short notice.  The regular meeting of the entire Supervisory Board which took place in February 2014 dealt
with matters relating to the 2013 financial year. 
Apart from one regular meeting,  which two members were prevented from attending due to other business
appointments that could not be postponed,  all Supervisory Board members attended all regular meetings in the
year under review.  The average attendance rate at meetings of the entire Supervisory Board was therefore just
under 97%.  All the committee meetings,  with the exception of one meeting of the Audit Committee and of the
General Committee,  were fully attended.  The external auditor,  KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft (KPMG)attended all regular meetings of the Supervisory Board,  inasfar as they did not deal with Executive Board matters. 
KPMG also attended all meetings of the Audit Committee.  The employee representatives held separate meetings to
prepare and discuss agenda items for the meetings of the entire Supervisory Board. 

Topics for the entire Supervisory Board
Our consultations and examinations focused on the following topics:

Situation and business development
The development of sales and earnings,  the employment situation as well as the financial position of the Group
and the business development of the Group's segments and individual regions were presented to us in detail by the
Executive Board following the close of the respective quarter and were discussed regularly.  Further ongoing topics
for discussion were the possible impact of global economic developments and negative currency translation effects
as well as the development of individual brands. 
In March 2013,  we reviewed and dealt intensively with the KPMG-certified 2012 annual financial statements and
consolidated financial statements,  including the combined management report for adidas AG and the Group,  as
well as the Executive Board's proposal regarding the appropriation of retained earnings.  In May,  the Executive
Board reported to us in detail about the measures initiated in connection with clearing up the compliance case that
had arisen at Reebok India Company.  In addition,  the Executive Board provided us with information on business
development and planned marketing activities in the football category in the run-up to the 2014 World Cup.  In
August,  we dealt intensively with the Group's new logistics and warehousing strategy and the possible financial
consequences.  At our extraordinary meeting in September,  the Executive Board informed us that,  due to recent
negative market developments,  the published sales and earnings targets for the year under review were no longer
achievable.  We discussed the reasons in detail,  including the recent intensification of negative currency effects,  the
continued softness in the global golf market and the unexpected short-term distribution constraints as a result
of the transition to a new distribution facility in Russia.  In November,  we were provided with detailed information
about the competition situation in the sporting goods market.

In the periods between meetings,  the Supervisory Board Chairman and the Audit Committee Chairman maintained
regular contact with the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer with respect to matters such
as corporate strategy,  business development and planning,  the risk situation and risk management as well as
compliance.  In addition,  the Supervisory Board Chairman was immediately informed about any significant events of
fundamental importance for evaluating the situation and development of the company and management activities.

Transactions requiring Supervisory Board approval
In accordance with statutory regulations and the Rules of Procedure of the Supervisory Board,  certain
transactions and measures require a formal resolution or the prior approval of the Supervisory Board. 
In the context of this requirement,  at our meeting in February,  we discussed in detail and approved the budget
and investment planning for 2013 presented by the Executive Board,  which,  in view of the macroeconomic
environment,  we deemed to be ambitious.  Additionally,  following completion of the project,  we approved the
dissolution of the 'Apple" committee,  which had been established ad hoc related to the acquisition of Adams
Golf,  Inc.,  USA in 2012.  At our meeting in March,  we discussed and resolved upon the resolutions to be proposed
to the 2013 Annual General Meeting,  including the proposal regarding the appropriation of retained earnings
for the 2012 financial year.  At an extraordinary meeting in June,  held by way of a conference call,  the Executive
Board provided us with detailed information on key strategic distribution centres leased by Group companies on a
long-term basis and the possible purchase thereof in the interest of optimising profitability.  We specifically dealt
with the Executive Board's proposal to purchase the strategically important distribution centre in Manchester,  UKhitherto leased by a Group company.  At our August meeting,  following the Executive Board's detailed presentation
on the future logistics and warehousing strategy for the adidas Group,  we resolved to invest in the distribution
centre in Brazil.  Additionally,  we dealt with the various possibilities for funding pension obligations of adidas AG
and approved funding in the form of a pension trust fund. 

Composition of the Executive Board 
20

In the year under review and at the beginning of 2014,  we took important decisions concerning changes on
the Executive Board.  At our meeting in May 2013,  we resolved to extend Erich Stamminger's Executive Board
mandate by a further three years,  taking due account of his excellent performance and successes in Global
Brands.  Furthermore,  after extensive consultation,  we approved the changes in the terms of his Executive Board
service contract,  following the General Committee's proposal.  At our Supervisory Board meeting in Septemberheld by way of a conference call,  we extensively discussed and resolved upon the appointment of Roland Auschel
to the Executive Board with responsibility for Global Sales,  effective October 1,  2013,  and we established his
compensation,  following the General Committee's proposal.  Roland Auschel has held various management
positions within the Group in Germany and abroad in the past 20 years.  With the creation of a separate Executive
Board function for Global Sales,  we have taken into account the importance of Global Sales for our company. 
At our extraordinary meeting on January 8,  2014,  after due consideration within the Supervisory Board as a
whole,  we complied with the request of our long-standing Executive Board member Erich Stamminger to release
him from his duties as Executive Board member effective March 5,  2014.  We approved the termination of his
appointment by mutual consent and,  following in-depth consultation,  resolved upon the appointment of Eric
Liedtke as member of the Executive Board with responsibility for Global Brands.  Eric Liedtke has held various
management positions within the adidas Group both in and outside Germany in the past 20 years.  At the same
time,  we determined his compensation and approved the termination agreement regarding the Executive Board
service contract with Erich Stamminger,  following the General Committee's proposal. 

Executive Board compensation
Key topics of our meeting as well as of our circular resolution in February 2013 were the determination of the
Performance Bonuses to be granted to our Executive Board members for 2012 and the redetermination of the
already paid Performance Bonuses for the 2011 financial year and the previous years,  as proposed by the General
Committee.  This reassessment was necessary as the financial figures relevant for determining the degree of
target achievement of our Executive Board members in 2011 and prior years had to be adjusted as a result of
the financial irregularities that had arisen at Reebok India Company,  which had also led to a restatement of
the consolidated financial statements for 2011 and prior years.  While the restatement of the financial figures
necessitated redetermination of the Performance Bonuses for the 2011 financial year and prior years,  resulting in
obligations for repayment by the Executive Board,  the already paid LTIP Bonuses 2009/2011 were not affected.

In March 2013,  following in-depth consideration,  we resolved upon the key performance criteria for granting the
2013 Performance Bonuses,  together with the individual short-term targets,  and determined the Performance
Bonus target amount relevant for each Executive Board member as proposed by the General Committee.  In
February 2014,  we discussed the performance of the Executive Board members in the year under review and
resolved upon the Performance Bonuses to be granted to them.

Corporate governance 
There was no indication of any conflicts of interest on the part of the members of the Executive and Supervisory
Boards which would require immediate disclosure to the Supervisory Board and would also require reporting to
the Annual General Meeting. 
There are no direct advisory or other service relationships between the company and a member of the
Supervisory Board.

Report including the Declaration on Corporate Governance  /   CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT INCLUDING THE

Efficient committee work
In order to perform our tasks in an efficient manner,  we have five Supervisory Board standing committees  /  
SEE
and also two project-related ad hoc committees,  which were established in 2009 and
2012.  These committees prepare resolutions of the Supervisory Board as well as topics for Supervisory Board
meetings.  In appropriate cases,  and within the legally permissible framework,  we have delegated the Supervisory
Board's authority to pass resolutions to individual committees.  With the exception of the Audit Committee,  the
Supervisory Board Chairman also chairs all the standing committees.  The committee chairpersons inform the
Supervisory Board about the content and results of the committee meetings at the subsequent meeting of the
entire Supervisory Board.

The Supervisory Board regularly monitors the application and further development of the corporate governance
regulations within the company,  in particular the implementation of the recommendations of the German
Corporate Governance Code (the 'Code").  In addition to our February meetings,  at which corporate governance
is usually the focal point,  we dealt in our August meeting with the amendments to the Code that were adopted
by the Government Commission on the German Corporate Governance Code on May 13,  2013,  essentially
concerning the subject 'Executive Board compensation".  At this meeting,  as well as at our meeting in February
2014,  we extensively discussed the recommendation to introduce caps for the variable compensation components
and resolved upon caps accordingly.  At the February meeting,  we also dealt extensively with the Code's
recommendation that,  when determining Executive Board compensation,  consideration should be given to the
relation between Executive Board compensation and that of top-level management and of employees overallincluding development of the compensation over time.  We discussed in detail how to define the respective
benchmark groups for the purpose of these comparisons,  and then passed a resolution accordingly.  At this
meeting,  after comprehensive discussion,  we also resolved upon the 2014 Declaration of Compliance.  The
Declaration of Compliance was made permanently available to shareholders on the corporate website at

/ The General Committee held six meetings in 2013,  two of them by way of a conference call.  An additional
meeting,  dealing with topics relating to the year under review,  took place in February 2014. 
The main focus of the meetings of the General Committee was the preparation of the resolutions of the
Supervisory Board as a whole relating to the Executive Board members' compensation as explained in detail
above in particular with regard to the concrete assessment of the Executive Board members' variable
compensation as well as resolutions relating to personnel changes on the Executive Board.  At its meeting in
February 2013,  the General Committee thoroughly discussed a resolution proposal for the Supervisory Board
concerning the amount of the Performance Bonuses to be repaid by the Executive Board members for the 2011
financial year and previous years.  It also assessed the individual degree of target achievement with respect to
the Performance Bonuses to be paid to the Executive Board members for the 2012 financial year and resolved
upon a corresponding recommendation to the Supervisory Board.  Additionally,  in March it discussed the new
performance criteria and targets as well as the target bonuses for the Executive Board members' Performance
Bonus plans for the year under review.  In September and December 2013,  it dealt with matters relating to
Executive Board compensation.  In February 2014,  it discussed the termination agreement regarding the Executive
Board service contract concluded with Erich Stamminger,  as well as the Performance Bonuses to be granted to
the members of the Executive Board for the year under review.  At each of these meetings,  the committee resolved
upon respective resolution proposals to present to the Supervisory Board. 

/ The Audit Committee held five meetings in the year under review and also one meeting in February 2014dealing with topics of the year under review.  The Chief Financial Officer and the auditor were present at all
meetings and reported to the committee members in detail.

The focal point of the committee's work in February 2013 was a preliminary examination of the annual financial
statements and the consolidated financial statements for 2012,  including the combined management report
of adidas AG and the Group,  as well as the Executive Board's proposal regarding the appropriation of retained
earnings.  Following an in-depth review of the audit reports with the auditor,  at its meeting in March the
Audit Committee recommended that the Supervisory Board approve the annual financial statements and the
consolidated financial statements.  In addition,  after obtaining the auditor's declaration of independence,  the
Audit Committee prepared the Supervisory Board's proposal to the Annual General Meeting concerning the
selection of the auditor of the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements for 2013. 
After jointly establishing the priority topics for the audit,  the committee discussed in detail the granting of the
corresponding audit assignments.  It then dealt in November with the audit fee arrangements and monitored
the auditor's independence and qualifications by obtaining information on the measures taken by the auditor
to guarantee independence and qualifications,  and assured itself that the auditor does not face any conflicts of
interest.  Furthermore,  the Executive Board provided the Audit Committee with information regarding tax and
customs strategies and the potential risks in these areas.  The members of the Audit Committee examined in
detail the quarterly financial reports and the first half year report,  together with the Chief Financial Officer and
the auditor,  prior to their publication. 
At a committee meeting in September,  the committee members focused solely on the topic of risk management
and the internal control system as well as the compliance management system.  In this context,  the committee
members dealt in particular with the main risk factors for the Group and the related control measures as well
as the further expansion of the compliance organisation and compliance management.  The committee members
critically analysed the audit results of the Internal Audit function and approved the audit plan for 2013/2014.  As
part of their examination of the effectiveness of the internal control system and the internal audit system,  the
committee members reviewed in depth the applied methods and systems and the effectiveness thereof with
the aid of written and oral reports.  In the course of the following comprehensive discussions,  inter alia with the
auditor,  they assured themselves of the effectiveness of the systems. 
In the context of the regular reporting of the Chief Compliance Officer on material compliance issues,  the
committee dealt intensively with the compliance case that had arisen at Reebok India Company and the
consequences thereof.

the appropriation of retained earnings and the auditor's reports were distributed by the Executive Board to all
Supervisory Board members in a timely manner.  We examined the documents in depth,  with a particular focus
on legality and regularity,  in the presence of the auditor at the Audit Committee meeting held on February 282014 and at the Supervisory Board's March 4,  2014 financial statements meeting,  during which the Executive
Board explained the financial statements in detail.  The Executive Board's commentaries concerning the goodwill
impairment necessary for the 2013 financial year were also a topic at these meetings.  At both meetings,  the
auditor reported the material results of the audit with a focus on the priority topics of the year under review as
agreed with the Audit Committee and was available for questions and the provision of additional information. 
The auditor did not report any significant weaknesses with respect to the internal control and risk management
system relating to the accounting process.  We also discussed in depth with the Executive Board the proposal
concerning the appropriation of retained earnings,  which provides for a dividend of € 150 per dividendentitled share and adopted it in light of the Group's good financial situation and future prospects as well as the
expectations of our shareholders.  Based on our own examinations of the annual and consolidated financial
statements,  we are convinced that there are no objections to be raised.  At our financial statements meetingtherefore,  following the recommendation of the Audit Committee,  we approved the audit results and the financial
statements prepared by the Executive Board.  The annual financial statements of adidas AG were thus approved.

Corporate Governance Report including
the Declaration on Corporate Governance 1)
Corporate Governance stands for responsible and transparent management and corporate control
oriented towards a sustainable increase in value.  These principles apply to all corporate functions and
are an essential foundation for sustainable corporate success.  We are convinced that good corporate
governance enhances the confidence placed in our Group by our shareholders,  business partnersemployees and the financial markets.  The following report includes the Corporate Governance Report
and the Declaration on Corporate Governance issued by the Executive Board and Supervisory Board. 

Dual board system
As a globally operating public listed company with its registered seat
in Herzogenaurach,  Germany,  adidas AG is,  inter alia,  subject to the
provisions of German stock corporation law.  A dual board system,  which
assigns the management of the company to the Executive Board and
advice and supervision of the Executive Board to the Supervisory Boardis one of the fundamental principles of German stock corporation law. 
These two boards are strictly separated in terms of membership and
duties and responsibilities.  In the interest of the company,  however,  both
Boards cooperate closely.

requirements for meetings and resolutions as well as for cooperation
with the Supervisory Board. 
At the Supervisory Board meetings,  the Executive Board reports in writing
and orally on the agenda items and resolution proposals and answers all
questions from the individual Supervisory Board members.  Additionallythe CEO and the CFO maintain regular contact and consult with the
Chairman of the Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee Chairman
on key aspects of strategy,  planning and business development as well
as on questions of risk management and compliance within the Group. 

Composition and working methods of the Executive Board
The composition of our Executive Board,  which consists of five membersreflects the international character of our Group.  No member of the
Executive Board has accepted more than a total of three supervisory
board mandates in non-Group listed companies or in supervisory bodies
of non-Group companies with similar requirements /

Additionally,  the Executive Board ensures appropriate risk management

The composition of the Supervisory Board,  which remained unchanged
in the year under review,  is in compliance with the aforementioned
objectives.  The term of office of the current members of the Supervisory
Board expires at the end of the Annual General Meeting on May 8,  2014. 
Pursuant to regulations of the Co-Determination Act,  the election of the
employee representatives will be held already in March 2014,  whereas
the shareholder representatives will be individually elected at the 2014
Annual General Meeting. 
The Nomination Committee of the Supervisory Board prepares the
election of shareholder representatives,  to take place at the 2014
Annual General Meeting.  When proposing candidates to the Supervisory
Board,  it takes into account the objectives set by the Supervisory Board
in terms of its composition as well as the requirements of the German
Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz AktG),  the Code and the Rules
of Procedure of the Supervisory Board.  Accordingly,  an increase in
female representation is a particular aim at the next Supervisory Board
elections.  In selecting nominees,  sufficient diversity in terms of different
professional backgrounds,  expert and industry knowledge as well as
experience in,  inter alia,  applying accounting principles and internal
control systems are again taken into account,  as at present.  The best
interests of the company will continue to play a decisive role when
nominating candidates for election.  The Supervisory Board does nothowever,  have a right to nominate candidates for the election of employee
representatives to the Supervisory Board.  Notwithstanding the abovethe Supervisory Board members strive to achieve the aforementioned
objectives for the composition of the entire Supervisory Board. 

The Supervisory Board is also responsible for the appointment and
dismissal of Executive Board members.  When appointing members of
the Executive Board,  the Supervisory Board takes care to ensure the
best possible composition of the Executive Board.  Experience,  industry
knowledge and personal expert qualifications play an important role
in this regard.  In October 2013,  Roland Auschel,  who has held various
management positions within the Group in Germany and abroad over
the past 20 years,  was appointed a member of the Executive Board.  He
took over the Board function Global Sales from Herbert Hainer.  In March
2014,  Eric Liedtke,  who has also held various management positions
within the Group both in and outside Germany in the past 20 yearswill succeed Erich Stamminger as a member of the Executive Boardresponsible for Global Brands.  To ensure that more suitable female
candidates are available for Executive Board positions in the future,  the
Supervisory Board strongly believes that it is necessary to increase the
number of women in management positions within the adidas Group. 
The Supervisory Board thus supports the Group's diversity conceptsparticularly regarding management development programmes,  with the
goal of increasing the representation of women on the Executive Board
in the long term. 
In order to increase the efficiency of its work,  the Supervisory Board has
formed five permanent expert committees from within its memberswhich,  inter alia,  prepare its resolutions and,  in certain cases,  pass
resolutions on its behalf.  These committees are the Steering Committeethe General Committee,  the Audit Committee,  the Mediation Committee
in accordance with § 27 section 3 MitbestG and the Nomination
Committee.  In addition,  the Supervisory Board has two project-related
ad hoc committees,  which were established in 2009 and 2012.  The
chairmen of the committees report to the entire Supervisory Board on
the results of the committee work on a regular basis.  The composition of
the committees and their respective tasks can be found on our website. 
Apart from tasks and responsibilities,  the Rules of Procedure of the
Supervisory Board and of the Audit Committee also set out the individual
requirements expected of the members and the procedure for meetings
and passing resolutions.  These Rules of Procedure are available on our
website.  The activities of the Supervisory Board and its committees in
the financial year are outlined in the Supervisory Board Report  /

As amended on May 15,  2012,  the Code stipulates additional criteria
concerning the independence of Supervisory Board members.  By
resolution dated February 12,  2013,  the Supervisory Board has thus
reconfirmed the objectives for its composition determined in 2011. 
With regard to independence,  the Supervisory Board considers that the
employment contracts of the employee representatives alone do not give
any grounds to doubt their independence as defined by the Code.  On this
basis,  the independence of all Supervisory Board members remains one
of its objectives. 

The Supervisory Board supervises and advises the Executive Board in
matters relating to the management of the company.  The Supervisory
Board is regularly,  expeditiously and comprehensively informed by the
Executive Board concerning business development and planning as
well as on the risk situation including compliance and coordinates the
strategy of the company and its implementation with the Executive Board. 
Moreover,  the Executive Board provides the Supervisory Board with the
annual financial statements of adidas AG and the annual consolidated
financial statements of the adidas Group for its approval,  taking into
consideration the auditor's reports.  Certain business transactions and
measures of the Executive Board with particular significance are subject
to Supervisory Board approval.

At its meeting held on February 9,  2011,  and in accordance with the
recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code ('the
Code"),  the Supervisory Board determined the following objectives for
its composition:
/ 
Maintain the composition of the Supervisory Board including
members with international background to the current extent. 
/ 
Maintain two female members on the Supervisory Board until the
next election of the Supervisory Board in 2014. 
/ 
Increase the degree of female representation on the Supervisory
Board as of the next election of shareholder representatives and
employee representatives in 2014; the Supervisory Board strives for
at least three female members on the Supervisory Board,  at least one
of them on the side of the shareholder representatives. 
/ 
Maintain the independence of all Supervisory Board members while
considering the work relationships of the employee representatives
vis-à-vis the company. 
/ 
Consider the age limit of,  in general,  72 at the time of election.

Declaration by the Executive Board and Supervisory Board of adidas AG
pursuant to § 161 German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz AktG)
on the German Corporate Governance Code
The Executive Board and Supervisory Board of adidas AG issued their last Declaration of Compliance pursuant to § 161 AktG on February 132013.  For the period from the publication of the last Declaration of Compliance up to June 10,  2013,  the following Declaration refers to the German
Corporate Governance Code (hereinafter referred to as the 'Code") as amended on May 15,  2012.  For the period as of June 11,  2013,  the following
Declaration refers to the recommendations of the Code as amended on May 13,  2013,  which was published in the Federal Gazette on June 10,  2013. 
The Executive Board and Supervisory Board of adidas AG declare that the recommendations of the 'Government Commission on the German
Corporate Governance Code" have been and are met with the following deviations:

Capping overall compensation and variable compensation components
(section 423 subsection 2 sentence 6 new version)
The service contracts of the Executive Board members existing at the time of this Declaration are capped regarding not only the fixed
compensation but also the variable compensation components.  They do not,  however,  stipulate a further separate cap for any potential special
bonus granted at the discretion of the Supervisory Board.  In our opinion,  compensation components granted at the discretion of the Supervisory
Board do not require a cap.  Nevertheless,  we intend to make a corresponding amendment to the service contracts as of their respective
extension or upon conclusion of a new contract.  The company cannot unilaterally interfere with existing contracts,  nor would such interference
be in line with the principle of contractual fidelity. 
20

13

50

Agreeing severance payment caps when concluding Executive Board service contracts (section 423 subsection 4)
In accordance with the recommendations of the Code,  contracts with a term of more than three years provide for a severance payment cap.  We
believe that for contracts with a term of up to three years the short contractual term agreed in connection with further contractual provisions
offers sufficient protection from inappropriate severance payments.  Hence,  no formal severance payment cap is planned. 

Disclosure of the shares held by the individual members of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board or
financial instruments related thereto (section 63 sentence 1 new version)
Insofar as no further statutory obligations exist,  we report the ownership of shares or related financial instruments if it exceeds 1% of the
shares issued by adidas AG,  but we do not report this on an individual basis for the members of the Boards.  Instead,  we publish the total
holdings of all members of the Executive Board and all members of the Supervisory Board separately in order to safeguard the Board members'
protectable interests.

Avoiding conflicts of interest
The members of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board are
obligated to disclose any conflicts of interest to the Supervisory Board
without any delay.  Substantial transactions between the company
and members of the Executive Board or persons in close relationship
with them require Supervisory Board approval.  The Supervisory Board
reports any conflicts of interest,  as well as the handling thereof,  to the
Annual General Meeting.  In the year under review,  neither the members
of the Executive Board nor the members of the Supervisory Board faced
conflicts of interest  /   SUPERVISORY BOARD REPORT,  P.  42.

Suggestions of the German Corporate Governance
Code fulfilled
In addition to the recommendations,  the Code contains a number of
suggestions for good and responsible corporate governance,  compliance
with which is not required to be disclosed by law.  The adidas Group is
fully compliant with all suggestions of the Code. 

Relevant management practices
Performance,  passion,  integrity and diversity are the values of our Group. 
They are actively lived by our Executive Board members,  Supervisory
Board members and our employees and have been incorporated into our
Code of Conduct.  Our business activities are oriented towards the legal
systems in the various countries and markets in which we operate.  This
implies a high level of social and environmental responsibility. 

Environmental responsibility and social commitment: For long-termsuccessful management of the Group,  sustainable actions that embracein particular,  social and environmental responsibility towards present
and future generations are essential.  Our Social & Environmental
Affairs department,  with its worldwide team,  has for many years been
dealing with the rights of employees in the supply chain as well as
with the coordination of the environmental strategy and product safety
management.

Every two years,  the Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee examine
the efficiency of their work including the collaboration with the Executive
Board.  Therefore,  suggestions for even better collaboration can be
made.  The review is conducted using questionnaires covering various
areas and criteria of the Supervisory Board's work.  Interviews are also
conducted with individual Supervisory Board members.  Subsequentlythe results are discussed within the Supervisory Board and/or Audit
Committee.  The most recent efficiency review took place in December
2012.  The analysis of the questionnaires was carried out by an external
consultant.  At the Supervisory Board and Audit Committee meetings in
February/March 2013,  the results were presented and discussed.  For
both bodies,  no major efficiency deficits were identified. 

Compliance with working and social standards: The development of
company guidelines with regard to social minimum standards,  work
safety as well as health and environmental protection and the monitoring
thereof at the production facilities of the adidas Group and its business
partners is an integral component of our corporate policy.  Our Group
has a separate Code of Conduct for the supply chain,  the 'Workplace
Standards" : //  
WWW. ADIDAS-GROUP. COM/EN/SUSTAINABILITY/SUPPLY-CHAIN/
SUPPLY-CHAIN-APPROACH.  These standards are oriented towards the
conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO) and follow the
code of conduct of the World Federation of the Sporting Goods Industry
(WFSGI).  They help us to only choose such business partners who fulfil
our Workplace Standards and business practices.  We have appointed
an expert team especially for the coordination of compliance with,  and
control of,  the Workplace Standards.  We report on our sustainability

regularly publish more detailed sustainability reports on our website.

The members of the Supervisory Board are individually responsible
for undertaking any necessary training and professional development
measures required for their tasks and,  in doing so,  are supported by
adidas AG.  The company informs the Supervisory Board regularly about
current legislative changes as well as opportunities for external trainingand provides the Supervisory Board with relevant specialist literature. 

In line with the Group-wide sustainability programme,  the adidas Group
developed a comprehensive environmental strategy.  The objective of
the strategy is to make processes more efficient and environmentally
friendly at every stage of the value chain.  This ranges from areas such
as product design,  material development and selection,  development
and sourcing,  logistics and IT systems,  to improving the efficiency
of company-owned locations.  Optimising these processes makes it
possible for the adidas Group to offer more sustainable products and
improve the company's environmental performance in the future.  With
our environmental strategy,  we have set precise goals concerning the
reduction of emissions.  A key element of these goals is the introduction
of uniform environmental management systems at company-owned
locations,  in compliance with ISO 14001 : //

Compensation Report 1)
For the adidas Group,  transparent and comprehensible reporting on the compensation of the Executive
Board and Supervisory Board are essential elements of good corporate governance.  In the followingwe summarise the principles of the compensation system and outline the structure and level of
Executive Board and Supervisory Board compensation.  We also report on the benefits which the
members of our Executive Board will receive in case of resignation from office or retirement. 

The compensation system is geared towards creating an incentive
for successful,  sustainably value-oriented corporate development
and management.  For determining the Executive Board members'
compensation particularly in terms of its appropriateness,  such factors
as the size and global orientation,  the economic situation,  the success
and outlook of the company are taken into consideration,  as well as
the typical level of compensation in comparison with peer companies
and with the compensation structure applicable for other areas of the
company.  In addition,  the tasks and contribution of each Executive Board
member to the company's success,  their individual performance as
well as the overall performance of the Executive Board are considered
when determining the compensation of the Executive Board.  It aims to
appropriately remunerate exceptional performance,  while diminishing
overall compensation when targets are not met.  Thus,  an appropriate
level of compensation can be ensured. 
The compensation system for the members of the Executive Boardwhich has been applicable since the 2012 financial year,  was adopted
by a large majority at the Annual General Meeting on May 10,  2012.  The
Supervisory Board considers the compensation of the Executive Board
to be appropriate,  both in comparison with the compensation of senior
management and of the employees overall,  as well as in terms of its
development over time. 

Components of the Executive Board compensation
The total compensation of the Executive Board members in case
of 100% target achievement is made up of around one-third fixed
compensation and two-thirds variable,  i, e.  performance-related
compensation components:
/  annual fixed salary is based on the tasks and responsibilities
The
of the individual Executive Board member.  It is paid in twelve equal
monthly instalments and remains unchanged for three years during
the term of the service contract. 

/  variable compensation consists of a Performance Bonus
The
measured over a one-year period,  payable following the adoption
of the annual financial statements of the past financial year,  and a
compensation component with a long-term incentive effect (LTIP
Bonus),  which is based on the Long-Term Incentive Plan 2012/2014
(LTIP 2012/2014) measured over a three-year period.  The variable
compensation components are designed in such a way that the
incentive to achieve the sustainable targets set for granting the
LTIP Bonus is significantly higher than the incentive to achieve the
Performance Bonus.  Corresponding contractual regulations ensure
that this weighting will also be maintained in the future.  More than
50% of the variable target compensation component is based upon
multi-year performance criteria. 
The variable components are structured as follows:
/  Performance Bonus serves as compensation for the Executive
The
Board's performance in the past financial year in line with the
short-term development of the company.  It is determined by the
Supervisory Board in a two-stage process: At the beginning of the
financial year,  the Supervisory Board establishes the differently
weighted performance criteria with their respective clear targetsand determines the individual amount of the Performance Bonus
target amount for each member of the Executive Board,  based on
 target achievement of 100% (Bonus target amount).  At the end of
the financial year,  the Supervisory Board examines the precise target
achievement of each Executive Board member and determines the
amount of Performance Bonus to be paid,  depending on the degree of
actual target achievement. 
As criteria for the 2013 Performance Bonus the Supervisory Board
established,  in addition to the individual performance of each
Executive Board member,  the following business-related criteria:
/ 
increase in net income attributable to shareholders/ 
improvement of the average operating working capital as a
percentage of sales,  and
/ 
improvement of the operating margin in the Retail segment.

1)  he total Executive Board compensation for 2012 does not include the amount placed in the reserves for the LTIP 2012/2014 for the 2012 financial year based on the forecasted degree of target

achievement as at the balance sheet date as this amount was agreed but not granted. 
2) Other benefits comprise contributions to pension insurance and non-monetary benefits resulting from the provision of company cars. 
3)  n accordance with Glenn Bennett's employment contract,  his compensation components were granted in US dollars.  An exchange rate of 12862 $/€ (2012 annual average rate) was used as

the basis for calculation. 

In calculating the amount of the Performance Bonus,  the degree
of target achievement determined for each individual performance
criterion is weighted according to the percentage value of the
respective performance criterion.  The sum of the weighted degrees
of target achievement of the performance criteria is then multiplied
by the individual Bonus target amount for each Executive Board
member.  The Performance Bonus is capped at a maximum of 150%
of the individual Bonus target amount.  If an Executive Board member
takes or leaves office during a financial year,  the Performance Bonus
is calculated on a pro rata basis. 

/ The LTIP Bonus serves in line with sustainability-oriented corporate
planning as compensation for the long-term performance of the
Executive Board.  It is determined by the Supervisory Board in a
two-stage process:
When determining the LTIP 2012/2014 at the beginning of the 2012
financial year,  the Supervisory Board defined the performance
criteria,  linked to clear targets and oriented towards the sustainable 
growth of the company,  and also defined the individual amount of the
LTIP Bonus target amount for each Executive Board member,  based
on a target achievement of 100% (LTIP Target Amount).  At the end
of the 2014 financial year,  the Supervisory Board will examine the
precise target achievement of each Executive Board member and
determine the amount of Performance Bonus to be paid,  depending
on the degree of actual target achievement.  Payout will be effected
after the 2014 consolidated financial statements are approved. 
The Supervisory Board has determined the following performance
criteria for the LTIP Bonus:
/ 
increase in net income attributable to shareholders/ 
increase in operating free cash flow/ 
increase in adidas NEO label sales,  and
/ 
development of the adidas AG share price. 
The assessment base for the individual performance criteria is the
three-year period from 2012 to 2014.

In determining the payout amounts for the Performance Bonus and the
LTIP Bonus,  the Supervisory Board may at its discretion,  depending on
the performance of the Executive Board and on the company's business
situation,  disregard any eventual (positive or negative) special factors
which impacted the calculation of target achievement,  having first
thoroughly evaluated the material circumstances. 
 compensation component resulting from a management share option
plan does not exist and is not planned.  The development of the adidas AG
share,  however,  constitutes one of the four performance criteria for the
LTIP 2012/2014. 
The total compensation paid to our Executive Board in the 2013 financial
year amounted to € 5558 million (2012: € 6141 million)  /

came into effect,  on October 1,  2013. 
3) Calculated pro rata temporis for the period beginning when Eric Liedtke's appointment came 
into effect,  on March 6,  2014. 
4) Due to Erich Stamminger's resignation effective March 5,  2014,  i, e.  during the LTIP 2012/2014

calculating period which continues until December 31,  2014,  the Supervisory Board at
its meeting on February 12,  2014 redetermined the target amount originally set for Erich
Stamminger when the LTIP 2012/2014 was established,  changing it to € 1980 million,  and
thus factoring in the premature termination pro rata temporis. 
5) Initial appointment of Herbert Hainer and Erich Stamminger: March 6,  1997.  For Glenn 
Bennett,  instead of his first appointment date (March 6,  1997),  January 1,  2000 is used for the
calculation of his pension entitlements with a base amount of 20% of pensionable income. 
Initial appointment of Robin J.  Stalker: January 30,  2001.  Initial appointment of Roland
Auschel: October 1,  2013. 

The Executive Board members are granted other minor benefits which
are individually taxed as required.  These benefits primarily consist of
paying for,  or providing the monetary value of,  non-cash benefits and
other benefits such as contributions to insurance schemes and the
provision of a company car.  The Executive Board members do not receive
any additional compensation for mandates within the adidas Group. 
The Executive Board members did not receive any loans or advance
payments from adidas AG. 

Pension commitments
All members of the Executive Board have individual contractual pension
commitments which are calculated based on the length of appointment
to the Executive Board as a percentage of contractually agreed
pensionable income. 
The amount of pensionable income for the members of the Executive
Board currently equals the individual fixed annual salary indicated in
the table.  Starting from a base amount totalling 10% of the respective
pensionable income,  a module of two percentage points of the
pensionable income is formed for each full year of tenure as an Executive
Board member 5). 
The Supervisory Board has,  as its targeted level of provision regarding
pension commitments for members of the Executive Board,  determined
 pension claim amounting to a maximum of 40% of an Executive
Board member's pensionable income.  Following the Executive Board
member's departure from the company,  benefit payments are made on
 monthly basis:
/  retirement pension upon reaching the age of 65,  or

/  disability pension in the event of occupational or general disability

for medical reasons,  for no longer than up to the point a retirement
pension is paid,  amounting to the pension entitlement reached at the
point the respective pension became payable;
/ 
survivor benefits upon the death of an Executive Board memberproviding the widow/er with 50% of the pension entitlements up to
this point and,  if applicable,  15% of the pension entitlements up to
this point for each dependent half-orphan or 30% for each dependent
orphan.  Taken together,  survivor benefits may not exceed the
deceased Executive Board member's total pension entitlement.  If
survivor entitlements exceed the pension entitlement,  benefits for
dependent children are reduced proportionately. 
In the event that an Executive Board member leaves the company prior
to reaching retirement age,  the non-forfeiture of the pension entitlement
will be in line with legal provisions.  The pension entitlement is not,  as
legally envisaged,  reduced pro rata temporis,  i, e.  it amounts to at least
the base amount of the pension commitment made to the Executive
Board member,  plus the pension modules accumulated annually during
the term of office.

For the ultimate evaluation of the Executive Board's performancequalitative criteria determined by the Supervisory Board when they
established the LTIP 2012/2014 are taken into account,  such as
developing an HR reporting system in alignment with GRI (Global
Reporting Initiative) guidelines.  The LTIP Bonus is capped at a
maximum of 150% of the individual LTIP target amount.  If the overall
degree of target achievement lies below 50%,  the Executive Board
member is not entitled to the LTIP Bonus.  If an Executive Board
member takes or leaves office during the calculation period for the LTIP
2012/2014,  the amount of LTIP Bonus due will be calculated on a pro
rata basis.  There is no claim to payout if an Executive Board member
resigns from office or voluntarily terminates his employment during
the LTIP 2012/2014 calculation period,  nor in the event of termination
for cause.  The LTIP Bonuses resolved upon by the Supervisory
Board will be paid upon approval of the 2014 consolidated financial
statements in the spring of 2015.  In case of 100% target achievement
for the three-year period from 2012 to 2014,  an LTIP Bonus will be
paid out totalling € 12639 million (Herbert Hainer: € 4620 million;
Roland Auschel: € 0687 million 2); Glenn Bennett: € 2604 million;
Eric Liedtke € 0438 million 3); Robin J.  Stalker: € 2310 million; Erich
Stamminger: € 1980 million 4) ). 

Other benefits and additional commitments 
20

In calculating the amount of the LTIP Bonus to be paid at the end of
the three-year period,  the degree of target achievement determined
for each individual performance criterion is weighted according to the
percentage value of the respective performance criterion.  The sum
of the weighted degrees of target achievement of the performance
criteria is multiplied by the individual LTIP target amount for each
Executive Board member.

Herbert Hainer,  Roland Auschel and Erich Stamminger,  who belonged to
the group of senior executives of adidas AG prior to their Executive Board
appointments,  will at the time of their retirement receive additional
payments from the 'Supplementary Retirement Provisions for Senior
Executives".  Until their appointment as Executive Board membersadidas AG had contributed pension components for Herbert HainerRoland Auschel and Erich Stamminger under these supplementary
provisions which were introduced for all senior executives of the
company in 1989. 
If an Executive Board member dies during his term of office,  his spouse
or partner receives or,  alternatively,  any dependent children receivein addition to pension benefits,  the pro-rata annual fixed salary for the
month of death and the following three months,  but no longer than until
the agreed end date of the service contract. 

Commitments to Executive Board members upon
premature termination of tenure
Executive Board service contracts are usually agreed with a contractual
term of three years.  This term will be shortened accordingly if the
Executive Board member reaches the age of 65 prior to expiration. 
/  the case of premature termination of tenure by mutual consent
In
and in the absence of good cause,  the Executive Board service
contracts for Glenn Bennett,  Roland Auschel,  Robin J.  Stalker and
Erich Stamminger do not provide for compensatory payments.  Unless
agreed otherwise on an individual basis,  the departing Executive
Board member receives the annual fixed salary and any Performance
Bonus,  both paid pro rata temporis up to the day he leaves officein addition to a follow-up bonus 6).  This is paid in two tranches
12 and 24 months following the end of the contract.  There is no
claim to a follow-up bonus if the Executive Board service contract is
terminated by release.  In general,  any claim to an LTIP Bonus payout
becomes void unless otherwise agreed on an individual basis.  Due
to the relatively short three-year contractual terms of these service
contracts,  a severance payment cap is not provided. 
The service contract of Herbert Hainer,  on the other hand,  with
 contractual term of more than three years,  does provide for a
compensatory payment of a maximum of twice the overall annual
compensation in the event of premature termination by mutual
consent,  limited to payment claims for the remaining period of his
service contract (Severance Payment Cap).  In this respect,  the overall
annual compensation means the overall compensation paid,  as
outlined in the Compensation Report,  for the last full financial year
prior to resignation from the Executive Board while considering the
expected total compensation for the current financial year. 

/  Herbert Hainer's service contract is terminated due to a change
If
of control,  his potential severance payment is limited to 150% of the
Severance Payment Cap.  The other service contracts do not include
such provisions. 
/  case of regular termination of the service contract,  i, e.  in case of
In
non-renewal of the service contract or termination upon reaching
the age of 65,  the respective Executive Board member is entitled to
receive not only his annual fixed salary on a pro rata basis up to the
day he leaves office,  but also a potential prorated Performance Bonus
and LTIP Bonus.  Additionally,  he is entitled to the follow-up bonus as
individually agreed. 

6)  his bonus amounts to 75% for Roland Auschel and Glenn Bennett,  100% for Robin J.  StalkerT
and 125% each for Herbert Hainer and Erich Stamminger and is based on the Performance
Bonus granted to the respective Executive Board member for the last full financial year.

Our Share 1)
In 2013,  international stock markets and the adidas AG share continued their bullish run from the prior
year and increased considerably.  Global central banks' promise to keep key rates low for an extended
period of time (Forward Guidance),  the recovery of the US economy as well as the stabilisation of
the euro area economy were key catalysts for strong market developments throughout the year. 
Discussions about a possible tapering by the Fed,  the lacklustre earnings seasons,  the looming US
government shutdown as well as geopolitical risk factors in certain regions only temporarily weighed
on equity markets.  This resulted in an increase of 25% in 2013 for both the DAX-30 and the MSCI World
Textiles,  Apparel & Luxury Goods Index.  The adidas AG share outperformed both indices,  supported
by ongoing strong performance in emerging markets and market participants' rising confidence in the
adidas Group's Route 2015 strategic business plan.  This more than offset a temporary weakness in the
share price following the amendment of the adidas Group's full year guidance during the third quarter. 
As a result,  at year-end the adidas AG share reached a new all-time high of € 9264,  representing an
increase of 38% compared to the prior year.  With the increase in the Group's net income attributable to
shareholders excluding impairment losses,  we intend to propose an 11% higher dividend compared to
2012 at our 2014 Annual General Meeting. 

International stock markets maintain positive momentum 
20

58

In 2013,  international stock markets maintained the positive momentum
from the previous year,  which resulted in new all-time highs for the
DAX-30 and the Dow Jones.  At the beginning of 2013,  US equity markets
improved considerably,  supported by the last-minute US fiscal cliff dealstrong US economic data and a better than expected US earnings season. 
European benchmark indices,  however,  underperformed international
equity markets due to setbacks in the euro debt crisis,  in particular the
bailout package for Cyprus as well as the impending political deadlock
in Italy.  In the second quarter of 2013,  equity markets continued their
bullish run,  supported by the ongoing accommodative monetary policy
of the major central banks.  This,  combined with improving US economic
indicators,  as well as the ECB's decision to further cut its key interest
rate by 25 basis points to 05%,  drove the DAX-30 and US equity markets
to new all-time highs at the beginning of May.  However,  signals that the
Fed could reduce its monetary stimulus,  together with disappointing
economic data in China,  resulted in a consolidation of equity markets
towards the end of the second quarter.  In the third quarter of 2013international stock markets improved significantly.  The key catalyst of
the uptrend was the recovery of leading economic indicators as well as
ongoing accommodative monetary policies of the ECB and the Fed.  This
more than offset the negative impact of a lacklustre Q2 earnings seasonthe looming US government shutdown as well as geopolitical risk factors

in certain regions.  Despite the reduction in the Fed's asset purchases
and disappointing third quarter GDP data for the euro area,  international
stock markets enjoyed a strong fourth quarter.  This was attributable to
the Fed's reconfirmation of its Forward Guidance,  rising global leading
indicators and the surprising rate cut by the ECB.  Furthermore,  robust
US economic data and the steady flow of new money into European
equity funds provided additional tailwinds for stock markets.  As a resultboth the DAX-30 and the MSCI World Textiles,  Apparel & Luxury Goods

At the beginning of the year,  the adidas AG share continued its positive
trend from the end of 2012 and clearly outperformed the overall market
and sector,  gaining 20% in the first quarter.  This performance was
mainly driven by positive analyst commentary about the positioning of
the adidas Group's brands and the Group's ability to further improve
profitability in 2013 as well as the introduction of the new adidas
Boost technology,  which was well perceived by media and the financial
community.  In addition,  the publication of the Group's 2012 financial
results on March 7,  with positive results in the company's key marketssolid balance sheet improvements and management's proposal to
increase the dividend by 35%,  further increased investor confidence. 
At the beginning of the second quarter,  the adidas AG share initially
suffered losses,  as some investors took profits in light of the strong
share price appreciation year-to-date.  However,  from mid-April
onwards,  the share price recovered,  as several analysts commented
positively in the run-up to the adidas Group first quarter results. 
Following the publication of first quarter results on May 3,  the adidas
AG share gained considerably,  as bottom-line results came in clearly
above market expectations.  This prompted several recommendation
upgrades and target price increases by analysts and,  together with
positive market sentiment,  drove the adidas AG share price to a new
high of € 8766 on May 22.  Towards the end of the second quarter,  the
adidas AG share came under pressure in line with overall equity market
weakness.  While most stock markets suffered significant losses,  the
adidas AG share however showed resilience and traded sideways.  In
the third quarter,  the adidas AG share declined and underperformed
the overall market.  The publication of first half year results on August
8,  which came in slightly below top- and bottom-line consensus,  as
well as disappointing reports by major US retailers towards the end of
August,  weighed on the share price development.  During the first half of
September,  the share price partially recovered due to improving market
trends.  On September 19,  the adidas Group amended its full year 2013
guidance,  as a result of intensified currency headwinds,  distribution
constraints and a softer consumer environment in Russia/CIS as well
as the overall weakness in the golf market,  resulting in a 3% share
price decline on the day following the ad hoc press release.  In the fourth
quarter,  the adidas AG share recovered and gained steadily,  supported
by the positive market feedback following the release of our nine
months results on November 7.  In particular,  sustained gross margin
strength as well as over-proportionate growth in emerging markets
was well received by market participants.  On December 2 and 3,  the
adidas Group Investor Field Trip,  hosted in Herzogenaurach,  Germanyaimed at reinforcing confidence in our Route 2015 targets,  helped to
sustain positive momentum.  Benefiting from positive market feedback
following the event,  the adidas AG share gained strongly towards the
end of the year.  As a result,  the adidas AG share closed 2013 at a new
all-time high of € 9264,  representing a 38% increase and a significant
outperformance relative to international stock markets /

adidas AG share historically outperforms
benchmark indices
The adidas Group is committed to continuously enhancing shareholder
value.  The long-term development of our share price reflects investor
confidence and the growth potential of our Group.  Over the last ten yearsour share has gained 310%.  This represents a clear outperformance of
the DAX-30,  which increased 141% during the period  /  
TABLE 01. 

adidas AG share member of important indices
The adidas AG share is included in a variety of high-quality indices
around the world,  most importantly the DAX-30 and the MSCI World
Textiles,  Apparel & Luxury Goods Index /  
TABLE 03.  The DAX-30 is
 blue chip stock market index consisting of the 30 major German
companies trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.  The MSCI World
Textiles,  Apparel & Luxury Goods Index comprises our Group's major
competitors.  At December 31,  2013,  our weighting in the DAX-30,  which
is calculated on the basis of free float market capitalisation and twelvemonth share turnover increased to 236% (2012: 213%).  Our higher
weighting compared to the prior year was mainly a result of the increase
in share turnover and the market capitalisation of adidas AG.  Within
the DAX-30,  we ranked 16 on market capitalisation (2012: 16) and 17 on
turnover (2012: 19) at year-end 2013.

Convertible bond significantly above prior year level
In March 2012,  adidas AG successfully issued a convertible bond,  due on
June 14,  2019,  for an aggregate nominal amount of € 500 million  /  
SEE
NOTE 17,  P.  209.  The bonds are not callable by the issuer or putable by
the bondholders until June 2017.  The bonds are convertible into up to
602 million new or existing adidas AG shares.  Proceeds from the offering
have allowed the Group to further optimise its debt structure.  The bonds
were priced with a 025% annual coupon and a conversion premium of
40% above the reference price of € 5961,  resulting in an initial conversion
price of € 8346 per share.  As a consequence of contractual provisions
relating to dividend protection,  the conversion price was adjusted to
€ 8310 per share.  This adjustment became effective on May 9,  2013.  The
convertible bond closed the year at € 12996,  significantly above the prior
year value level of € 11430.

Since its launch on December 30,  2004,  our Level 1 American Depositary
Receipt (ADR) facility has enjoyed great popularity among American
investors.  Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas runs our Level 1 ADR
Programme.  Our Level 1 ADR closed 2013 at US $ 6423,  representing
an increase of 43% versus the prior year level (2012: US $ 4480).  The
more pronounced increase of the Level 1 ADR price compared to the
ordinary share price was due to the depreciation of the US dollar versus
the euro at the end of 2013 compared to year-end 2012.  While the
number of Level 1 ADRs outstanding reached a new high in July 2013
with 128 million Level 1 ADRs outstanding,  the number decreased
to 92 million at year-end 2013.  This compares to 118 million Level 1
ADRs outstanding at the end of 2012.  The average daily trading volume
decreased 14% to 35800 ADRs in 2013 (2012: 41500).  Since November
2007,  the adidas AG ADR is quoted on the OTCQX International Premier

Meeting (AGM) on May 8,  2014 (2012: € 135).  Subject to the meeting's

shareholders as well as analysts.  In 2013,  Management and the

Furthermore,  in order to provide an update on our Route 2015 strategic
business plan,  we hosted an Investor Field Trip in Herzogenaurach from
December 2 to 3,  2013.  The event was attended by more than 50 investors
and representatives of the financial community.  Our efforts to deliver
best-in-class services to our investors and analysts were again highly
acknowledged in 2013.  In June,  the adidas Group won the prestigious
IR Magazine Award in the Personal Care & Household/Luxury Goods
sector.  In addition,  in an investor relations survey conducted by Thomson
Reuters,  the adidas Group was ranked second again by buy-side analysts
in the sector Consumer/Luxury Goods.

Boundaries" ranked second among the German DAX-30 companies
for the prestigious 'Best Annual Report 2013" award granted by the
German business magazine 'manager magazin".  The prize is awarded
by a jury which reviews 160 annual reports from across Germany's most
important stock indices,  the DAX-30,  MDAX,  SDAX and TecDAX.  After
winning this title in 2007 and 2012,  and coming narrowly second in 2011this is the fourth time the adidas Group has ranked among the top two.

Group Strategy
The adidas Group strives to be the global leader in the sporting goods industry with brands built
upon a passion for sports and a sporting lifestyle.  Inspired by our heritage,  we know that a profound
understanding of the consumer and customer is essential to achieving this goal.  To anticipate and
respond to their needs,  we continuously strive to create a culture of innovation,  challenging ourselves
to break with convention and embrace change.  By harnessing this culture,  we push the boundaries
of products,  services and processes to strengthen our competitiveness and maximise the Group's
operational and financial performance.  This,  in turn,  will drive long-term value creation for our
company and our shareholders.  To achieve this goal,  we have made strategic choices and will prioritise
our investments under six key strategic pillars.

process  /   INTERNAL GROUP MANAGEMENT SYSTEM,  P.  118.  Therefore,  we
SEE
are focused on rigorously managing those factors under our controlmaking strategic choices that will drive sustainable revenue and
earnings growth,  and ultimately operating cash flow.  Across our operations,  we pursue in particular the avenues for growth which we expect
to be most value-enhancing,  with particular emphasis on improving
brand strength and Group profitability.  In addition,  rigorously managing
working capital and optimising our capital structure remain key priorities for us.  Furthermore,  we are committed to increasing returns to
shareholders with above-industry-average share price performance and
dividends  /   OUR SHARE,  P.  58. 
SEE

Diverse brand portfolio
Consumers want choice.  Whether it is the athlete looking for the best
possible equipment,  or the lifestyle consumer searching for the next
fashion trend,  we are inspired to develop and create experiences that
engage consumers in long-lasting relationships with our brands.  To
maximise our consumer reach,  we have embraced a multi-brand
strategy.  This approach allows us to tackle opportunities from several
perspectives,  as both a mass and a niche player,  providing distinct and
relevant products to a wide spectrum of consumers.  In this way,  each
brand is able to keep a unique identity and focus on its core competencies,  while simultaneously providing our Group with a broad product
offering,  increasing our leverage in the marketplace  /   GLOBAL BRANDS
SEE
STRATEGY,  P.  77. 

Investments focused on highest-potential markets
and channels
As a Group,  we target leading market positions in all markets in which we
compete.  However,  we have prioritised our investments based on those
markets which offer the best medium- to long-term growth and profitability opportunities.  In this respect,  we place considerable emphasis on
expanding our activities in the emerging markets,  particularly China and
Russia/CIS,  as well as building our market share in underpenetrated
markets for the Group,  such as the USA. 
No matter in which market we operate,  we recognise that consumer
buying behaviour and the retail landscape are unique.  Therefore,  to fully
exploit market opportunities,  we tailor our distribution strategy to present
our brands to the consumer in the most impactful way.  This is achieved
by following a distinctive but coordinated channel approach.  To this endwe strive to provide our customers with superior service to secure prime
shelf space for our brands,  while continuing our commitment to building
strategic competency in own retail and e-commerce  /   GLOBAL SALES

STRATEGY,  P.  72. 

Creating a flexible supply chain
Speed and agility are key to outpacing the competition.  We are committed
to meeting the full range of customer and consumer needs by ensuring
constant product availability in the correct size and colour,  providing
game-changing technical innovations and also the latest high-end
fashion products to the highest quality standards.

 key strategic priority is to enable faster product creation and production
by continuously improving our infrastructure,  processes and systems.  By
sharing information from point of sale to source and vice versa,  we strive
to connect and more closely integrate the various elements of our supply

adidas Group Route 2015 strategic goals
In November 2010,  the Group unveiled its 2015 strategic business
plan named 'Route 2015",  which defines strategies and objectives for
the period up to 2015.  This plan is the most comprehensive the adidas
Group has ever developed,  incorporating all brands,  sales channels
and Group functions globally.  Based on our strong brands,  premium
products,  extensive global presence and commitment to innovation and
the consumer,  we aspire to grow our business significantly until 2015. 
According to our plan,  total Group sales are targeted to grow 45% to
50% on a currency-neutral basis over the five-year period,  thereby
outperforming total market growth (both GDP and sporting goods
industry).  In addition,  we aim to grow our bottom line faster than the top
line.  It is targeted to grow annual earnings at a compound annual growth
rate of 15% and to reach an operating margin of 11%. 
In December 2013,  although acknowledging that the achievement of our
goals will be more challenging than originally anticipated,  Management
confirmed its Route 2015 aspirations for the Group  /  
TABLE 02.  Howevergiven further headwinds from the weakening of several currencies
versus the euro since the beginning of 2014,  we believe there is now
an even higher risk to the achievement of our 2015 aspirations  /

SEE MANAGEMENT ASSESSMENT OF
PERFORM­ NCE,  RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES,  AND OUTLOOK,  P.  180. 


In order to reach our Route 2015 strategic goals,  we have defined clear
strategic priorities.  These include:

/  Clear brand positioning and prioritisation: We believe that we have
significant growth potential to exploit from our portfolio of brands.  The
majority of our targeted growth will come from Global Brands,  which
we anticipate will contribute over 80% of the Group's expected revenue
increase over the period /  
SEE GLOBAL BRANDS STRATEGY,  P.  77.  Areas
within the adidas and Reebok brands that have been identified as key
contributors to sustainable growth for the adidas Group include:
/ 
adidas Sport Performance: gaining sales and market share in the
running and basketball categories. 
/ adidas Originals & Sport Style: expanding in the fast-fashion business
with the adidas NEO label and maintaining the strong momentum of
adidas Originals. 
/ 
Reebok: establishing Reebok as the leading fitness brand. 
/  Expand presence in key growth markets: We have identified North
America,  Greater China,  Russia/CIS,  Latin America,  Japan and the UK
as key growth markets.  Of those markets,  the three "attack markets"
North America,  Greater China and Russia/CIS are expected to contribute
around 50% of the total Group growth under the Route 2015 planwith each market targeting a double-digit compound annual growth
rate  /   GLOBAL SALES STRATEGY,  P.  72.  In the USA,  the Group's brands
SEE
have enormous potential to gain market share by focusing on improved
distribution and allowing a higher share of products to be specifically
designed for that market.  In emerging markets such as China and
Russia/CIS,  rising standards of living,  increasing disposable incomepositive demographic trends and growing sports participation should
support demand for sporting goods.

/  Maintain financial flexibility: We strive over the long term to maintain
 ratio of net borrowings over EBITDA of less than two times.  A strong
balance sheet increases our flexibility to realise value-generating
medium- and long-term opportunities in the best interests of our shareholders as they arise.

In addition,  we have identified several profit levers across the Group to
support improvements in profitability.  For example,  we are targeting
improved product margins with initiatives such as range efficiencywhere we have the goal to achieve a 25% range reduction by 2015.  In
wholesale,  we are improving our business by sharpening our trade
terms policies and reducing our exposure to lower-quality channels of
distribution,  focusing on higher-quality partners more aligned to where
our target consumer is shopping.  On our mission to become a best-inclass retailer,  we continuously strive to improve the operating margin
in our Retail segment.  In manufacturing,  we are combatting inflation in
the supply chain by increasing our investments in automation and new
production techniques.  Also,  our investments in infrastructure such as
the new distribution centres near Osnabrueck/Germany and Chekhov/
Russia will ensure we increase capacity in a cost-efficient way to
service all of our channels,  be it Wholesale,  Retail or eCommerce  /  
SEE

believe there is significant potential to increase the Group's operating
margin to 11% sustainably by 2015.

/  Leverage growth and operational scale through to bottom line: A
higher exposure to emerging markets as well as expanding controlled
space activities are important levers to improving brand presenceincreasing sell-through and driving higher Group profitability.  In additionwe continuously work on streamlining internal processes to accelerate
decision-making,  reduce complexity and make our organisation leaner
and more efficient.  At the beginning of 2011,  we launched Driving Route
2015 to act as a key enabler to achieve these aspirations.  The objectives
of Driving Route 2015 are very clear: speed,  consistency and consumer
focus. 
/ 
Speed by implementing an organisation that allows faster
decision-making. 
/ 
Consistency by establishing a more aligned and efficient organisation
across functions and geographies. 
/ 
Consumer focus by reducing internal complexity,  enabling us to put
more of our energy into what really matters the consumer. 

20

/  Intensify controlled space focus: We intend to increase the portion of
sales that comes from controlled space initiatives to over 50% of Group
sales in the coming years (2013: 48%).  This includes new openings of
adidas and Reebok own-retail stores,  the further extension of our
mono-branded franchise store base in markets such as China,  as well
as new shop-in-shop initiatives with retail partners around the world. 
In terms of our own retail,  we intend to open at least 750 adidas and
Reebok stores between 2010 and 2015,  as well as grow significantly our
eCommerce business,  which we project to increase to € 500 million by

Global Sales Strategy
Global Sales aims to drive the commercial performance of the adidas Group by building brand desiremeeting consumer needs at all times and capturing additional consumer potential.  Global Sales is
responsible for all commercial activities of the adidas and Reebok brands,  serving our consumers
through three channels: Wholesale,  Retail and eCommerce.  This channel-focused approach has
allowed us to establish strong market positions globally,  deepening and expanding our cooperation
with leading wholesale partners,  operating one of the biggest mono-branded store chains in our
industry and becoming a significant e-commerce player with one consistent global platform. 

Global Sales strategic priorities until 2015

20

13

72

Global Sales directs all local market organisations responsible for the
distribution of the adidas and Reebok brands.  On 365 days a year and
at more than 140000 points of sale,  the Global Sales team is aiming to
create desire for the adidas and Reebok brands and grow market share
through wholesale partners,  own-retail stores and our e-commerce
activities.  The strategic business plan Route 2015 outlines our long-term
priorities:
/ 
increasing the share of controlled space to over 50% of Group sales
by 2015/ 
driving growth and maximising brand potential in key demographic
locations and
/ 
leveraging cross-channel sales opportunities and range efficienciesfacilitated by our omni-channel approach. 
Besides these priorities,  we strive for business growth particularly in
North America,  Greater China,  Russia/CIS,  our emerging markets in the
Middle East and Latin America,  in Japan and in our newly created market
set-up for Western Europe.  Of these markets,  the three attack markets
North America,  Greater China and Russia/CIS are targeted to contribute
around 50% of the sales increase we anticipate as part of Route 2015. 

With the aim of putting ourselves at the forefront of our industry,  Global
Sales is currently in the process of evolving its strategy from a channel
focus to an integrated omni-channel approach,  which will better enable
us to achieve a globally consistent product offer,  brand communicationavailability and service across all channels and consumer touchpoints. 
This evolution of the strategy will help to align more consistently the
delivery of our product concepts globally.  An example of this can already
be seen with the unveiling of the official FIFA World Cup match ball
which was globally launched on December 3 and sold as of December 4
in a synchronised manner across our Wholesale,  Retail and eCommerce
channels. 
With the creation of a separate Global Sales function on the adidas Group's
Executive Board,  our commitment to drive more growth opportunities
and leverage from our sales processes across channels and country
borders has also been reflected structurally.  The new organisational
set-up integrates all sales activities under one roof.  It also includes a
new market structure for Western Europe: As of 2014,  we will serve the
European consumer with one integrated organisation,  building on our
far-reaching concept store network and our eCommerce platform which
is now live in most European markets.  The major European retailers will
be served by one sales organisation,  ensuring market consistency. 

Global Sales to drive omni-channel approach
The playing field for Global Sales has undergone fundamental changes
over the past few years: Driven by the digitalisation of communication
tools,  consumers are increasingly informed about product and service
offers,  they are socially engaged,  and they shop wherever and whenever
they like,  regardless of country borders or opening hours.  Reacting to
the shift in consumer behaviour,  many brick & mortar retailers are
harmonising their market approach across channels,  and are growing
their business across country borders.  E-commerce pure players are
expanding globally,  and vertical retailers are widening their assortment
into sporting goods.

Toolkit drives market management
In order to drive speed and consistency within our selling processeswe have developed a set of methods and standards that are brought
together in a common global toolkit for our sales teams.  These enable
us to permanently seek and use best practices around the world and
help us to continuously improve other methods within the markets.  The

The objective of the Wholesale channel is to deliver sustainable profitable
market share growth in collaboration with third-party retailers.  We strive
to establish long-term partnerships with the most dynamic retailerswhich include sporting goods chains,  department stores,  buying groupslifestyle retail chains and e-tailers.  To achieve this,  we have established
the Global Wholesale S P O R T strategy  /

Customer and range segmentation to exploit
market potential 
Retail Strategy 
As part of our toolkit,  our customer and range segmentation initiative
is a key enabler to consistent customer relationship management. 
This facilitates the allocation of tailored product packages to groups
of comparable customers.  In principle,  the segmentation is based on
the distinction between sports and lifestyle retailers that have either a
brand-driven or a commercial positioning. 

Retail plays an increasingly important role for the future of our Group
and our brands and is a key driver on our Route 2015 journey.  The
reasons are manifold:
/  showcase the breadth of our brands and product offering,  for
To
example in our adidas Brand Centres,  as a benchmark for retail
partners. 
/ To provide consumers access to our products in mono-branded stores
in the high streets and malls around the world. 
/  create distribution in markets which do not have traditional
To

/  leverage our learnings from direct interaction with consumers
To
through own retail for the entire organisation. 
/  provide a clearance channel (i, e.  factory outlets).

Our overall vision is to improve our operation KPIs and retail sophistication
with the goal of delivering healthy,  sustainable growth with outstanding
return on investment,  executing as a best-in-class retailer.  In order to
achieve this,  we will execute against the four key pillars:
/

Focusing on customer service
People development programme to build the
best sales team
Wholesale is facing a changing customer landscape,  driven by further
consolidation,  increased cross-border retail activities and a digital shift
in consumer behaviour.  We strive to have the best team in our industryenabling us to react flexibly to all market developments.  This means
continuous skills development.  The Wholesale people development and
training framework called PEAK (Performance,  Excellence,  Activation
and Knowledge) sets the expectations for individual excellence and
provides tailored training programmes.  All Wholesale employees attend
at least one training programme per year. 

Building on the strong foundation laid over the past years,  our Retail
strategic initiatives are now structured and prioritised against the
principles of growth and efficiency.  We want to further simplify our
structures and procedures in order to free up resources for all important
consumer-facing tasks.  This focus on efficiencies will also enable the
successful implementation of our growth initiatives,  which include:
/ 
Customer Service Model: Deliver and embed a defined Customer
Service Model that connects,  engages and inspires our consumers
during their shopping experience. 
/ 
Customer Relationship Management: Develop and implement a
tailored CRM programme. 
/ 
Further drive product commonality by increasing the global
mandatory range share in all our own stores. 
/ 
Drive people excellence through improved training and development
procedures. 
/ 
Omni-channel focus: Create a seamless shopping experience for our
consumers by connecting our online and offline touchpoints.

Global Brands Strategy
Global Brands is responsible for brand positioning,  brand strategy,  product creation,  innovation and
all the product and brand marketing functions of the adidas and Reebok brands.  The primary objective
of this portfolio strategy is to ensure that our brands seize market share and category opportunities
through well-defined and coordinated go-to-market strategies.  Each brand is responsible for the
execution of its strategic focus by creating a constant stream of innovative and desirable products
and generating communication strategies that connect with their target consumer in an engaging and
compelling way. 

Focus on the consumer 
To secure long-term sustainable growth for the Group,  Global Brands is
focused on driving the development of the adidas and Reebok brands. 
The overall strategic goal is to achieve qualitative,  sustainable growth
by building desirable brands in consumers' perception.  Global Brands
played a central role in the creation of Route 2015,  the adidas Group's
strategic business plan that was unveiled in 2010.  The adidas and
Reebok brands are expected to deliver more than 80% of the targeted
growth for the Group until 2015. 

The consumer and creating consumer desire for our products is at the
heart of everything we do.  By constantly developing desirable products
and inspiring brand experiences,  we can drive sustainable and quality
growth,  building a strong reputation and loyalty with consumers. 
Moreover,  we also understand that,  in order to have credible and
authentic connections to create such desirability with our consumerswe must have the right market segmentation strategy.  As part of its
function,  Global Brands has mapped out our target consumer universewhich spans from our roots in sport,  the 'pure performer",  through to
today's style setters who have embraced sporting goods brands as part
of their lifestyle  /  
DIAGRAM 01. 

Areas within adidas and Reebok that were identified as key contributors
and game changers for the adidas Group include:
/ 
Gaining sales and market share in the key global categories running
and basketball with adidas Sport Performance. 
/ 
Expanding adidas Sport Style in fast fashion with the adidas NEO label. 
/ 
Maintaining adidas Originals' strong momentum with the fashiondriven lifestyle consumer.

Global Brands also plays a key role in bringing the efficiency initiatives

in a more consistent way around the world in terms of ranges and
pricing.  In the long term,  this should lead to range size efficiencies and
gross margin optimisation.  One example of this is the creation of the
'Global Foundation Range" for each brand,  which will be mandatory for
all of our markets and channels.

To be successful across consumer segments,  we acknowledge that a
strategy of mass production or mass marketing is no longer sufficient. 
Only by identifying and understanding consumers' motivations and
goals for doing sport,  their individual lifestyle,  their fitness level and
their buying habits can we create meaningful products,  services and
experiences that build a lasting impression and brand loyalty.  In this
respect,  we have identified five key global trends which will be important
to address with our brands and sub-brands over the duration of Route
2015:

/  Fit for life: Sport is no longer just about competing and winning. 
Sport is becoming more embedded in consumers' everyday lifestyles. 
Motivations and goals are becoming more holistic,  fun,  socialising and
life-enhancing. 
/  You are what you know and what you do: Society is embracing a
life-long learning attitude,  and placing more emphasis on what we know
and do versus what we have and where we come from. 

20

13

78

/  Celebrating individuality: Consumers increasingly fulfil their desire
to differentiate themselves from one another by being more creative on
the one hand mixing and matching products and services they need,  and
on the other hand seeking personalised offerings tailored for them.  The
growth in social media continues to fuel more and more opportunities to
display individuality,  making it even more important. 
/  Together is better: There is an increasing need for meaningful social
interaction,  both online and offline,  as consumers become more mobileand digital technologies and social networks make it easier for them to
connect with like-minded people. 

To match these trends and fulfil consumer demands,  Global Brands
teams adhere to the following principles:
/ 
Create the unexpected through product and brand experience. 
/ 
Create the highest emotional connection between our brands and the
consumer. 
/  prepared for the next generation,  anticipating change. 
Be
/ 
Simplify to the maximum. 
/ 
Show excellence in execution,  being consistent in what we do,  from
idea creation to communication. 

Brand architecture and differentiation
We believe that our Group's multi-brand structure gives us an important
competitive advantage.  Through our brand architecture,  we seamlessly
cover the consumer segments we have defined,  catering to more
consumer needs,  while at the same time keeping clarity of brand
message and values. 
Each brand and sub-brand is responsible for bringing its own distinct
positioning to life,  through the creation of products and communications
that not only support the commercial functions in their day-to-day
business activities,  but also provide the platform and framework for
long-term market share and profitability improvements.  While adidas
and Reebok each have unique identities,  heritages,  technologiesdesigns and reputations,  the strategic principles and methods for driving
future sales growth and profitability improvements are common to both. 
These include:
/ 
Leadership in product innovation to excite and inspire the consumer. 
/ 
Marketing and communication leadership. 
/ 
Activation and validation via a relevant set of promotion partnerships. 
/ 
Extending brand reach and appeal through strategic partnerships. 

/  Back to basics: For everyday life,  products and services are desired
to be simple and authentic,  making consumers' lives easier.  There is
 growing interest in outdoor activities and minimalistically designed
products,  reflecting the desire to reconnect and be in tune with nature.

No other brand has a more distinguished history and stronger connection
with sport than adidas.  adidas is where the best meet the best,  such

else around the world where sports are played,  watched,  enjoyed and
celebrated.  As a true global brand with German roots,  adidas' mission
is to be the leading and most desired sports brand in the world.  One
major lever to achieve this is the brand's broad and unique product
portfolio,  spanning from apparel and footwear for professional athletes
to premium fashion.  It allows adidas to address multiple consumer
needs,  exploit market opportunities from various angles as well as be
less affected by one-dimensional market risks.  adidas' commitment to
product innovation and its rich heritage differentiates the brand from
competitors and provides a solid platform for future growth.

As part of our market segmentation strategy and to increase our
addressable market to the lifestyle and fashion consumer,  several
sub-labels under the banner of adidas Sport Style were established
To increase our appeal to a younger,  more price-conscious generation
of lifestyle consumers,  the adidas NEO label was established to cater
specifically to their needs.  adidas NEO specifically targets the young
fashionable teen,  aged between 14 and 19 years,  with the 16-year-old as
the sweet spot.  These teens are 'digital natives" and live for now.  They
are ready to go,  discovering their own way and style,  and the NEO label is
all about them  /  
PICTURE 07.  It is all about being open and engaged with
this teenage consumer,  enabling them to participate with the label and
enjoy experiences that only NEO can provide,  such as styling an outfit
for Selena Gomez or being part of the NEO collection created especially
for the New York Fashion Week.  To ensure success,  the NEO formula
employs a 'fast fashion" business model.  This means quick reaction
to emerging trends through shorter lead times and excellence in retail
execution.  In addition,  adidas Sport Style also partners with a number
of top designers,  such as Yohji Yamamoto with the Y-3 brand,  and luxury
brands,  such as Porsche Design  /

strive to enhance their positions as premium brands.  This,  in turn,  is
an important catalyst for sustaining and improving the brands' gross
margins,  making continuous innovation an important enabler for future
profitability improvements. 

Marketing and communication leadership
To be competitive in the sporting goods industry,  brands must build
clear desirability with their target consumer.  To achieve this,  adidas
and Reebok are focused on creating inspirational and innovative brand
marketing campaigns and developing communication techniques
that strengthen their positioning,  build brand equity and thus support
the achievement of the Group's commercial goals.  A key tenet of our
marketing and communication strategy is to harness the emotion of

In addition,  Global Brands also endeavours to ensure all of its brands
are at the forefront of new communication techniques,  particularly as
the information flow becomes faster and faster.  To increase the pace
and relevance of our brands' communication with the consumer,  digital
marketing now acts as a backbone for all brand marketing activities. 
Whether through in-store or online customisation platforms,  social
networks,  mobile apps or digital broadcast mediums,  these methods
are providing a new scope of consumer experience in a real-time way. 
With consumers spending more time online,  the adidas and Reebok
digital strategies allow the brands to move from campaign-based
communication to developing deeper relationships with their respective
target audience.  In addition to adding significant value to all our
communication efforts,  our digital marketing and social interaction with
consumers also provide the brands with accessible insights,  learnings
and measurable results,  which in turn can be utilised to drive long-term
brand equity.

round.  Reebok is also creating a global social centre at its headquarters
in Canton.  This centre and its team will engage the Fit Generation
consumer in the social world and enable Reebok to be part of the

exciting and relevant content.

of metalwoods,  are examples of the brand's product strategy to achieve
this goal.  Tight Lies fairway woods are engineered with a low-profile

Golfers of all levels are influenced by the equipment that the world's
best professional players play with and wear.  Hence,  TaylorMade-adidas
Golf's leadership and presence on the world's major professional golf
tours is imperative to increasing brand exposure and consumer traction. 
The strength of the TaylorMade-adidas Golf Tour Staff lies in the number
and quality of its members,  which include global stars such as 2013
U.S.  Open champion Justin Rose,  Dustin Johnson,  Sergio Garcia,  Jason
Day,  Martin Kaymer,  Y. E.  Yang,  Sean O'Hair,  Retief Goosen,  Johnson
Wagner,  Justin Leonard,  Camilo Villegas,  Paula Creamer and Natalie

tour professionals also play TaylorMade metalwoods,  helping to make
TaylorMade the number one driver brand on the world's six major
tours – the PGA Tour,  European Tour,  Japan Tour,  Champions TourWeb, com Tour and LPGA Tour.  The visibility and credibility that

instrumental to brand and product awareness.  Adams Golf likewise
maintains a strong Tour Staff,  having this year added global star and fan

 rebranding at Adams Golf in 2013,  including the unveiling of a new

and on-tour activities,  including teaming up with Southwest Airlines
to give away a million Southwest air miles.  The Southwest logo was
added to the bags of Adams Golf Tour Staff pros,  and a variety of Adams

Ashworth likewise generated excellent attention with its 'Pants Petition"

Key concepts bring the 'style made comfortable"
positioning to life 
Rockport was founded in 1971 on the idea of making fashion footwear
comfortable by using the latest in athletic shoe technologies.  Today,  the
brand continues to combine this DNA with the innovation resources of
the adidas Group,  to design products which deliver uncompromised style
with state-of-the-art engineered comfort.  With its mission,  Rockport
aims to become one of the world's leading leather footwear brands. 

With the metropolitan consumer at the centre of extensive integrated
market research and product development efforts,  Rockport has
evolved its offering propositions and established four core strategic
product concepts: truWalkZero,  RocSports Lite,  Total Motion and Seven
to 7.  These concepts will serve as key platforms to build long-term
recognition and trust for the brand's product offering with consumers. 
Each concept is based upon key industry and consumer trends which
enable the brand to drive both the innovation and commercial agendas. 
For example,  truWalkZero is minimalist in design and construction to
maximise lightness and mimics the foot's natural walking motionmaking it the perfect active casual staple to propel consumers through
their day.  Total Motion,  on the other hand,  incorporates premium
materials for a glove-like fit and controlled flexibility from its advanced
construction technologies  /

After successfully establishing the Rockport brand strategy and
positioning over recent years,  brand recognition has increased and its
positioning appeals to a broad consumer base.  The Rockport appearance
continues to become more dynamic and focused on product storytelling
by emotionalising the brand's unique product benefits to consumers.  To
support growth,  a high-quality distribution network and strong execution
of the brand at the point of sale globally is critical.  Therefore,  Rockport
has a number of key strategic initiatives in place to improve and expand
the brand's representation in the marketplace:
/ 
One global range built with clear channel-specific segmentation and
price architecture and supported with aligned operational capabilities
and go-to-market strategies to be competitive in each channel. 
/ 
Tailored local distribution strategies to maximise the business across
all channels and geographies.  This includes intensifying relationships
with premium retail accounts in key wholesale markets such as
the USA as well as expanding the own-retail footprint,  to further
strengthen the brand's image in the marketplace. 
/ 
Online retail excellence through industry-leading e-commerce and
digital capabilities,  for both wholesale and retail,  driving convergence
to the omni-channel strategic vision. 
/ Elevating presence at the point of sale,  through significant investments
to further connect with the consumer on an emotional level in both
own-retail and wholesale environments.

Total Motion pump 
With this strategic approach,  Rockport can target the same consumer
type in both the men's and women's business.  With only 24% of
Rockport's total sales in the women's business,  expanding the product
offering and distribution reach of this part of the business is the
biggest growth opportunity for Rockport.  While the brand promise
applies equally to both genders,  Rockport also understands that both
genders have significantly different requirements in terms of product
offering,  particularly in servicing the higher demands and depth of
assortment to be relevant to the female consumer.  Therefore,  the brand
made significant investments in world-class design and development
capabilities in 2013 by opening the Rockport Design Studio in the Veneto
region of Italy.  With this studio,  Rockport has access to the best talent
and industry knowledge in the field of women's design,  fashion industry
know-how and technical shoe development.

Reebok-CCM Hockey is a leading designer and
marketer of ice hockey equipment and apparelwith two of the world's most recognised ice
hockey brand names: Reebok Hockey and CCM. 

Focus on high-end performance
Reebok-CCM Hockey's primary goal is to lead in the high-end performance
segment of the hockey market.  Going to market with a dual-brand
portfolio (consisting of Reebok Hockey and CCM),  Reebok-CCM Hockey
has a clear focus on product innovation,  supported by professional player

Global Operations
Global Operations manages the development,  production planning,  sourcing and distribution of the
majority of our products.  The function continually strives to increase efficiency throughout the Group's
supply chain and ensure the highest standards in product quality and delivery performance for our
customers and our own-retail and eCommerce activities at competitive costs. 

Clearly defined priorities for Global Operations until 2015
The vision of Global Operations is to be closest to every consumer.  The
function strives to provide the right product to consumers in the right
size,  colour and style,  in the right place,  at the right time,  across the
entire range of the Group's channels and brands. 
Global Operations has a strong track record for establishing state-ofthe-art infrastructure,  processes and systems.  The function has been
successfully consolidating and improving legacy structures,  reducing
complexity and cost for the Group.  By taking strong ownership for qualitycost and availability,  the Group has proven that it is able to respond to the
fast-changing requirements of consumers and customers. 

To support our Route 2015 strategic business plan,  Global Operations
focuses on delivering against five function-specific strategic priorities
driven by several key initiatives /  
TABLE 01.  By continuing to deliver
on these initiatives,  Global Operations will not only enable the Group
to achieve its goals,  it will also ensure our supply chain remains a
competitive advantage in making us the partner of choice for our
consumers and customers alike.  This continues to be underlined by
our strong 'On-Time In-Full" (OTIF) KPI,  which measures the adidas
Group's delivery performance towards customers (Wholesale) and our
own-retail stores /  
SEE INTERNAL GROUP MANAGEMENT SYSTEM,  P.  118.  In
2013,  the adidas Group delivered 82% of its adidas and Reebok products
'on time" and 'in full" (2012: 78%).  For 2014,  Global Operations strives to
maintain OTIF at a level of around 80%.  It is also planned to roll out OTIF
to those markets that are currently not in scope.

In the area of manufacturing excellence for footwear,  automation
represents the key driver for efficiencies.  As part of this initiativewe support the implementation of state-of-the-art machinery and
solutions,  such as computer stitching,  high-frequency cutting and
automated production lines across factories,  and provide technical
competency training to factory floor staff.  The resulting improvements
in the factories are both visible and tangible.  With less manual labour
required,  manufacturers were able to reduce operating space and
energy while increasing their right-first-time rate and optimising their
operator utilisation.  For apparel,  our goal is to use the manufacturing
excellence initiative to roll out modular production lines.  In additionwe have introduced Global Sewing Data (GSD) a globally recognisedindustry-leading pre-determined motion time system.  It is an accurate
and consistent way to measure the standard production time or Standard
Minute Value (SMV) of a product. 
The Profitability Management department assumes a central role in
realising cost competitiveness by driving our strategic costing efforts and
optimising our buying strategies.  Throughout 2013,  the team focused on
implementing a more data-driven and standardised cost approach for
the apparel division which,  in turn,  enables consistent benefit capture of
efficiency initiatives. 
In 2014,  we will focus on implementing a more data-driven approach
for material costing in order to further manage our cost base.  In addition
to material,  we will consolidate product types within the apparel supply
chain. 

Providing industry-leading availability
Global Operations is building five new supporting system solutions that
use SAP as a basis to standardise,  automate,  bundle and execute market
processes and system functionalities.  The roll-out of these systems and
processes is a prerequisite to enable enhanced value-added services
(e.g.  labelling,  price tags and RFID tags) at our factories and distribution
centres.  These are also critical for our flexible make-to-stock servicewhich aims to improve product availability and inventory utilisation by
planning and building inventory buffers at different locations further up
the supply chain.  In 2013,  we went live with our make-to-stock solution
for the European never-out-of-stock and teamwear business. 

In addition,  Global Operations is a key contributor to the Group's Integrated
Business Planning (IBP) project  /   INTERNAL GROUP MANAGEMENT SYSTEMSEE
P.  118.  IBP forms part of the Group's strategic business plan Route 2015
and aims at establishing a coherent end-to-end demand and supply
planning process across finance,  marketing,  operations and sales. 
Other capabilities that the function is building include an increased
level of transparency on lead times in our supply chain.  This will allow
for timely and accurate instructions on delivery times,  planning and
purchasing,  resulting in a reduction of workload and increased customer
satisfaction.  Another important aspect will be the introduction of the
capability to transfer inventory between locations in a more automated
manner. 

Enabling later ordering
Enabling later ordering is a cross-functional priority in Global Operations
focused on allowing our customers and own-retail network to order our
products closer to the time of sale,  facilitating buying decisions that are
based on better market knowledge. 
This initiative for reducing standard lead times focuses on shortening
production lead times on footwear and apparel to 60 days.  This will
allow us to align sales processes across the brands and improve
efficiencies.  The majority of adidas footwear is already on 60 days. 
The implementation for apparel started in early 2012,  with the goal to
transition a third of all styles for all brands to 60 days.  We successfully
achieved our target for the fall/winter season 2014,  where over 50% of
forecast volume will be supplied on the shortened lead time of 60 days. 
For future seasons,  we target to supply 90% of forecast volume on the
shortened lead time of 60 days. 
Further order-to-delivery lead time reductions will be achieved
through increased proximity to sourcing countries,  which will enable
us to manufacture closer to our key markets to deliver and replenish
products faster.  While 2012 saw the introduction of an in-season
response solution for own retail in Russia/CIS and Western Europe,  in
2013 Global Operations replenished 57 million units of footwear and
apparel in-season in Russia/CIS.  We will continue to further develop this
approach towards almost one third of our Russia/CIS business.

Global Operations focuses on further optimising product creation
through an efficient and simplified material and colour selection
process.  This,  coupled with increased automation in manufacturing,  will
enhance productivity,  shorten lead times and improve overall quality. 
These improvements are expected to enhance profitability for the Group
and ensure we provide our consumers with the best value proposition
possible.

SEE
GLOBAL BRANDS STRATEGY,  P.  77. 

Modernising the Group's infrastructure
Global Operations continues to focus on building the required
infrastructure,  processes and systems to support the Group's growth
plans.  This includes further process simplification,  consolidation of
legacy systems and distribution structures,  as well as the creation of
state-of-the-art systems required to support new business demands. 

In 2013,  Global Operations completed two state-of-the-art,  multibrand warehouses.  The first is located near Osnabrueck,  Germanyand went live in June,  followed by a new distribution centre in ChekhovRussia,  which started to operate in July.  During the same month,  Global
Operations faced capacity and systems challenges in the existing
distribution centre in Klimovsk,  Russia,  which resulted in a backlog of
deliveries to stores and consumers for the Russian market.  As a resultthe decision was made to ramp up capacities of the new distribution
centre in Chekhov ahead of plan.  Deliveries were stabilised during the
course of the fourth quarter and are now fulfilling market demands. 
The vast majority of our facilities operate a standardised warehouse
management system which continues to be rolled out to all new and
existing warehouses in the operations network. 

Majority of production through independent suppliers
To minimise production costs,  we outsource almost 100% of
production to independent third-party suppliers,  primarily located
in Asia.  While we provide them with detailed specifications for
production and delivery,  these suppliers possess excellent expertise
in cost-efficient,  high-volume production of footwear,  apparel and
hardware.  The latest list of our suppliers can be found on our website

sports technologies as well as sustainable product innovation.  Additionally,  investments and research
emphasis will also include areas such as new manufacturing processes and advanced materials. 

R&D an integral part of the product and user
experience creation process 
Selective purchase of external R&D expertise 
Our innovation teams analyse new materials,  production processes and
scientific research to increase the exchange and scope of idea generation. 
Their scope also extends to areas such as consumer insights and social
media.  This helps promote a holistic and innovation-focused culture
which gives deeper consumer insights,  while also fuelling creativity and
synergies across the organisation.  To identify innovative materials as
well as integrate sustainability,  cost and production process aspects into
the development phase,  the innovation team is in close contact with our
sourcing and material teams within product development who,  in turnwork closely with our suppliers. 
Once conceptualised,  new product technologies are engineered using
state-of-the-art systems.  Furthermore,  by embracing entirely new
production technology and material approaches,  product creation and
development can be decoupled from traditional processes.  Extensive
virtual prototype testing and engineering loops are carried out on every
technology,  which promotes faster development phases as well as
improved concept and quality,  while simultaneously reducing physical
material and resource requirements.  Once a new product technology is
deemed viable,  it is produced as a physical sample.  These samples are
then comprehensively tested by a broad range of users,  including top
athletes.  Only when these comprehensive tests have been successful
are the technologies handed over to product marketing,  which
commercialises the technology to a final product. 

In November 2013,  the adidas Group announced that it has commenced
 collaborative initiative called Speedfactory,  which is a research project
under the umbrella of the German government.  It focuses on a new
era of manufacturing by combining state-of-the-art information and
communication technologies (ICT) with industrial production,  innovative
products and skill-intensive electronic services.  Research topics include
production logistics,  cognitive basic technologies,  human-machine
interaction and 3-D industrial applications.  For more information on

In 2013,  adidas performed research studies with the University of
Freiburg,  developing and validating features of the adidas miCoach
XCell,  a digital biometric device that measures heart rate,  accelerationjump height,  speed-to-brake reaction times and shifts left or right of
the wearer.  Usability studies were carried out with the University of
Michigan.

R&D is closely integrated with the sourcing,  design and product
marketing functions.  At the beginning of the product creation processmarketing defines a development priority,  which,  in recent yearshas increasingly included sustainability targets.  This is derived on a
case-by-case basis from a combination of consumer research and
feedback,  competition analysis and own product testing. 

In addition to its internal R&D efforts,  the adidas Group also purchases
 limited amount of R&D expertise from well-established research
partners.  This strategy allows for greater flexibility and faster access
to know-how.  Moreover,  this accelerates the rate at which knowledge
is built up internally and across the Group,  with synergies and
productive skill networks being created that enable deep and long-term
relationships with research partners.  To increase efficiency and protect
research results,  collaborations are usually long-term and exclusive. 
Major adidas relationships exist with the University of Calgary,  Canadathe University of Michigan,  USA,  the University of Loughborough,  UKthe University of Erlangen-Nuremberg and the University of FreiburgGermany.

R&D within the adidas Group follows a decentralised approach.  In line
with their strategic and long-term visions and distinctive positioningeach brand runs its own R&D activities,  generally with either a category
or a technology focus.  However,  fundamental research as well as
expertise and competencies in sustainable product creation are shared
across the Group.

adidas also carried out extensive testing of the official match ball for
the 2014 World Cup,  Brazuca,  to evaluate the effect of ball strikes under
various conditions and validate extensive scenario modelling.  The tests
concluded that Brazuca meets and exceeds all required metrics for a
FIFA official match ball.  Brazuca was tested over a two-and-a-half-year
period involving more than 600 of the world's top players,  including
Lionel Messi,  Zinedine Zidane,  Steven Gerrard and Iker Casillas.  The ball
was also tested with 30 teams in ten countries across three continentsmaking it the most tested adidas ball ever and ensuring that it is suited
to all conditions. 
In 2013,  Reebok continued its long-term biomechanics research
relationships with Arizona State University and the University of Las
Vegas.  R&D of Reebok hard goods equipment in partnership with
Loughborough University also continued in 2013.  In addition,  Reebok
established a research initiative on wearable electronics with the
University of Ottawa. 

TaylorMade-adidas Golf continued its long-term cooperation with
researchers at the University of Calgary in 2013,  with extensive joint
swing dynamic studies,  identifying the influence of club specifications on
player performance and perception. 

Active trademark and patent protection policy
To capitalise on the Group's R&D achievements,  we seek patent
protection for our innovations.  We also own a substantial portfolio of
registered trademarks for the Group's brands and related proprietary
names.  As part of our business policy,  we enforce the Group's trademarks
and patents by monitoring the marketplace for infringements and taking
action to prevent them.  This includes a vigorous anti-counterfeiting
programme.  We also have comprehensive processes,  and undertake
significant research,  to avoid infringement of third-party intellectual
property rights.  As we use a wide range of different technologies in
our products,  we are not dependent upon any single technology,  or any

Highly skilled technical personnel 
R&D expenses at prior year level 
Our R&D departments comprise experienced and multi-skilled people
from different areas of technical expertise and from diverse cultural
backgrounds.  All R&D personnel are part of a highly connected and deep
knowledge network,  both across the Group and with external partners. 
 significant part of our innovation process,  and therefore personnel and
skill base,  relates to consumer and user insights.  Product designersengineers and sport scientists as well as material engineering experts
focus on product development.  Process and production specialists also
form an essential part of our product development competencies.  Other
professional backgrounds include software development,  electronic
engineering,  Finite Element Analysis,  advanced CAD design and
kinesiology. 

Each year,  we invest considerable resources into developing and
commercialising new technologies as well as fresh design ideas,  in
order to offer the best experience for our users.  R&D expenses include
expenses for personnel and administration,  but exclude other costs,  for
example those associated with the design aspect of the product creation
process  /   NOTE 02,  P.  195.  In 2013,  as in prior years,  all R&D costs
SEE
were expensed as incurred.  adidas Group R&D expenses remained
stable compared to the prior year at € 128 million (2012: € 128 million). 
Personnel expenses represent the largest portion of R&D expensesaccounting for more than 72% of total R&D expenses.  In 2013,  R&D
expenses represented 21% of other operating expenses (2012: 21%). 
R&D expenses as a percentage of sales remained stable at 09% (2012:
09%)  /  
TABLE 02. 

We aim at improving our ability to adapt to changing consumer
preferences more quickly,  flexibly and efficiently.  We achieve this by
facilitating the direct interaction with and involvement of our suppliers in
product creation,  quality control,  product testing and commercialisation. 
In 2013,  we continued to enhance our computer simulation research
platform to further reduce the time to market of product innovations. 
This software system,  with its advanced material and design capabilitiesallows for more creativity in the design phase and significantly improves
the level of product detailing.  While increasing speed and reducing the
need for physical product samples and testing in the R&D processthe benefits also translate into other Group commercial and efficiency
initiatives.  Advanced 3-D models contributed to the Group's crossfunctional virtualisation project,  where since 2010,  when this project
began,  until year-end 2013 we reduced the number of manufactured
physical samples by over 23%.  An additional benefit of creating virtual
assets is their application in other areas,  such as e-commerce,  computer
games,  virtual merchandising and digital communication. 

We believe developing industry-leading technologies and user
experiences is only one aspect of being an innovation leader.  Even more
important is the successful commercialisation of those technological
innovations,  while consistently increasing our commitment to sustainable
product development.  The awards we attained in 2013 highlight our
technology leadership within the sporting goods industry  /  
TABLE 04. 
As in prior years,  the majority of adidas Group sales were generated
with products newly introduced in the course of 2013.  New products tend
to have a higher gross margin compared to products which have been
in the market for more than one season.  As a result,  newly launched
products contributed over-proportionately to the Group's net income
in 2013.  We expect this development to continue in 2014 as our launch
schedule includes a full pipeline of innovative products  /   SUBSEQUENT

The adidas brand introduced numerous major product innovations in
2013.  These included:
/  partnership with key material supplier BASF,  adidas launched
In
 groundbreaking material innovation called Boost.  Boost was
successfully launched in the running category,  with Energy Boostand over the course of the year was subsequently integrated in
other running shoes.  Tests conducted by the adidas innovation
team (ait. ) show that the highly durable Boost material provides the
highest energy return in the running industry.  The material was also
demonstrated to be three times more temperature-resistant,  when
taken from +40 to 20 degrees Celsius,  than standard EVA material. 
In 2014,  Boost will be brought into other sports categories such as
basketball and snowboarding. 
/  Springblade is the first running shoe designed to help propel
The
the wearer forward using specially designed blades.  Each shoe has
16 highly elastic blades that help translate that energy forward with
each step while providing cushioning and one of the highest returns
in the industry.  Each blade,  built from high-tech polymers,  is precisely
tuned in geometry,  thickness and position for each phase of a runner's
stride to provide support and flexibility and a full range of movement. 
/ In November 2013,  adidas launched miCoach Smart Run,  an advanced
and intuitive wrist-based running digital device.  This smartwatch
enables runners of all abilities to track their runs using GPS mappingmonitor their heart rate directly off their wrist,  listen to their music
and get real-time coaching,  all in a single,  colour-touchscreen
running watch.  The device uses no cables,  straps or additional
sensors.  For more information on the adidas miCoach franchise

MICOACH. ADIDAS. COM. 
/ In football,  adidas announced the adidas miCoach Smart Ball,  which is
designed to improve footballers' technique,  power,  spin and accuracy
through an automated coaching system.  The ball has in-built sensors
that track the ball's movement and feed the information back to the
players through an app on their smartphone. 
/ 
adidas also unveiled the official match ball for the 2014 World CupBrazuca,  which features technology incorporated into the bladder
and carcass that is identical to the Tango 12 (UEFA EURO 2012)Cafusa (2013 FIFA Confederations Cup) and the UEFA Champions
League official match balls.  However,  a new structural innovation
with a unique symmetry of six identical panels alongside a different
surface construction provides improved grip,  touch,  stability and
aerodynamics on the pitch.

strategic priorities.  Group HR is committed to the three workstreams
'Leadership",  'People" and 'Capabilities"  /  
DIAGRAM 01.  2014 activity will
focus on embedding and activating existing programmes and concepts. 

We continue to have a strong focus on investing in the way we work
and lead across our global leadership teams.  Over 85 global leadership
teams (700 leaders) are taking part in a 'Leadership Journey".  These
journeys include intensive sessions of self-reflection of mindsets,  and
360° feedback. 

Enabling employees to reach their personal best
We continue to focus on elevating our leaders' strengths,  in particular
how leaders create the right environment for our employees to be
inspired,  committed and motivated. 

To reach their personal best,  our Group employees are offered a wide
variety of learning opportunities,  building on their strengths,  improving
their skills and overcoming their own challenges.  Our highest priority
is to match individual employee aspirations with our organisational

The Functional Trainee Programme (FTP) is an 18-month programme
providing graduates with an international background and excellent
educational credentials the opportunity to start a functional career
within the adidas Group.  The programme comprises six three-month
assignments in various departments.  At least one of these assignments
takes place abroad.  At year-end 2013,  we employed 57 participants in
our global FTP (2012: 62). 

er 
In addition,  we offer tailored graduate programmes.  The Business
Management Programme (BMP),  a 24-month international,  crossfunctional and cross-brand programme,  is aimed at attracting
professionals with MBA degrees and three to five years of work
experience.  The goal of this programme is to prepare them for future
management positions within our Group.  At year-end 2013,  six
employees were participating in the BMP globally (2012: 12).

/ 
Management Development Programme (MDP): a global programme
which is executed regionally.  This programme is tailored to employees

Our development programmes are complemented by apprenticeship and
internship programmes.  The adidas Group apprenticeship offers young
people who want to join our Group directly out of school the opportunity
to gain business experience in a three-year rotation programme.  The
programme includes vocational training in retail,  industrial management
and IT,  as well as integrated study programmes.  At the end of 2013we employed 59 apprentices in Germany (2012: 56) and 62 integrated
study programme students (2012: 48).  Our global internship programme
offers students three to six months of work experience within the adidas
Group.  It plays a key role in our recruiting strategy.  At the end of 2013,  we
employed 532 interns in Germany (2012: 492). 

Performance-driven remuneration system 
Performance management: To further drive a high-performance culture
within the adidas Group,  in 2013 we rolled out our new performance
management approach: The Score.  The Score is our overarching concept
to bring target setting,  employee development and performance
appraisal under one common process.  While continuing to build on our
key values of performance management,  The Score also brings more
focus,  simplicity and alignment in setting team and individual targets and
provides clarity for both teams and individuals about how to successfully
achieve them.  Each employee is evaluated and receives feedback at least
twice a year,  and employee development planning is further supported
by the new process and system solution. 

Bonus programme: In order to allow our employees to participate in
the Group's success,  and to reward them for their target achievementwe have implemented a global bonus programme.  This programme
combines individual performance (measured in the The Score process)
and corporate performance (actual financial results measured against
such targets as Group,  Channel,  Brand and/or Market).  To further drive a
high-performance culture within the adidas Group,  we also implemented
changes to our bonus programme as of 2013 to support alignment with
business targets and put more emphasis on individual targets through
the rewarding element of the bonus programme. 

The succession management process is supported by a system solution
which is applied in 91% of the adidas Group's business units and is
becoming part of our Integrated Talent Management Process and
System through a step-by-step implementation approach. 

Long-term incentive programmes: In order to encourage sustainable
financial results as well as retain our top leadership,  the adidas Group
offers Long-Term Incentive Programmes (LTIP) for leaders and Executive
Board members.  We value the contributions of our leadership team and
provide this compensatory benefit to encourage continued performance
and commitment.  Other benefits include our 401(k) retirement plans
in the USA and the adidas Group pension plan for our employees in
Germany.  In 2013,  2315 employees participated in the latter,  which
represents 48% of all eligible employees. 
Our Group subsidiaries also grant a variety of benefits to employeesdepending upon locally defined practices and country-specific
regulations and norms.

Profit participation programme: For employees at our Group
headquarters and our other locations in Germany who do not participate
in the bonus programme,  we have a profit participation programme
called the 'Champions' Bonus". 

20

Succession management: The adidas Group succession management
approach aims to ensure stability and certainty in business continuity. 
We achieve this through a globally consistent succession plan which
covers successors for director level positions and above,  including
the Board positions of the Group.  These positions and the respective
potential successors are regularly discussed by senior management
and our global HR leadership teams.  The succession reviews create
 clear picture of the successor readiness and outlines the necessary
development actions.  Based upon this information,  we ensure individual
development plans are in place to prepare successors for their potential
next steps.  We also use the successor information to create dynamic
talent pools and hence have a clear understanding of the areas that
need immediate or strategic action.  All information is consolidated in a
succession management risk analysis. 

We are committed to rewarding our employees with compensation
and benefit programmes that are competitive in the marketplace. 
Remuneration throughout the Group comprises fixed and variable
monetary compensation,  non-monetary rewards,  as well as other
intangible benefits.  The cornerstone of our rewards programme is
our Global Salary Management System,  which is used as a basis
for establishing and evaluating the value of employees' positions
and salaries in a market-driven and performance-oriented way.  In
addition to a fixed base salary,  we offer our employees various variable
compensation components.

Online communication platforms to drive employee
engagement,  collaboration and learning
We believe that a robust and state-of-the-art internal communication
platform is essential for driving employee engagement and fostering
learning and open collaboration within our organisation.  For examplethe Group intranet is based on blogs and wikis,  allowing departments
and teams to quickly build and edit their own internal communication
platforms.  We actively encourage employees to share knowledgecollaborate and discuss current topics.  As an example,  we have an
'Ask the Management" platform on our intranet,  enabling employees to
openly address questions to our senior leaders which are then answered
promptly.  In 2013,  we laid the foundation for a brand-new enterprise
collaboration platform which will be the adidas Group's new internal
global digital home.  It will bring the intranet,  online collaboration
platforms and important system applications under one roof.  The
solution will be employee-centric and comes with a high degree of
personalisation,  empowering and connecting users across departments
and locations and turning the adidas Group into a truly networked
company.  It will be rolled out to all headquarter locations in 2014,  with
subsequent integration for non-headquarter locations. 

20

13

108

In 2013,  we also launched a new Learning Management System in
headquarter locations and selected key markets to streamline our
classroom training registration processes and provide access and
reporting around selected training activities.  In 2014,  the scope will be
expanded to further support our Group's commitment to implement
innovative learning tools and approaches. 

Creating an attractive work environment
We aim to offer our employees an attractive work environment.  In this
context,  the following aspects play a central role:
Work-life integration: We aim to harmonise the commercial interests
of the adidas Group with the private and family needs of our employees. 
Our Work-Life Integration Programme includes flexible work time
and place,  people development and leadership competence related to
work-life integration,  as well as family-oriented services.  The adidas
Group is therefore focusing on programmes which give employees the
option to combine their careers with private life.  In addition to providing
flexible working arrangements,  teleworking,  sabbaticals and parent/
child offices,  we have had a child-care facility at our company premises
in Canton,  USA,  since 2002,  and in 2013 we opened a day-care centre for
110 children at our global headquarters in Herzogenaurach,  Germany. 
The World of Kids started with fully booked places in September 2013
and focuses on healthy nutrition and movement.  It is run bilingually
(English/German) and caters for children as young as three months until
they are of school age. 

Diverse sports activities for employees: In addition,  we offer our
employees a wide range of sports activities at our major sites,  in which
partly also their partners and family members can participate.  Employees
in Herzogenaurach,  Portland,  Canton and at other subsidiaries have
access to a company gym and numerous other sports facilities.  Our
Company Sports department in Herzogenaurach also organises various
team and individual sports activities.  In 2013,  the Company Sports
department in Germany offered 309 courses and 41 events,  which were
attended by more than 6000 participants (2012: > 4400). 
Diverse workforce key to success: As a global company,  we understand
that it takes people with different ideas,  strengths,  interests and
cultural backgrounds to ensure we achieve our goals.  A high degree
of diversity is already represented within our workforce.  At our Group's
global headquarters,  for example,  we have employees from more than
70 nations.  Our broad international employee population works in over
40 locations outside their 'home" countries.  As an employer who truly
believes in building global career opportunities for employees,  we see
value in nurturing global perspectives to be more readily able to meet
the needs of our global consumers. 
Diversity is one of the adidas Group's four core values.  We strongly
believe that mixed leadership teams contribute to the strength of our
company,  and we are committed to bringing this to life.  We have joined
other DAX-30 companies in an effort to increase the proportion of
women in management to between 32% and 35% by 2015 (currently: 28%
worldwide).  To reach this,  we have over-achieved our goal to increase
the proportion of women in our leadership development programmes
to over 35%.  The Supervisory Board of adidas AG has committed to
increase the degree of female representation to at least three female
members at the next election in 2014,  with at least one to be on the
/ SEE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT INCLUDING THE
shareholders' side    
DECLARATION ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE,  P.  48.  Since 2012,  the adidas
Group has been an active member of the 'Charta der Vielfalt" ('Diversity
Charter") in Germany in order to share our best-practice knowledge
regarding awareness of diversity and inclusion in the work environment. 
Our efforts to develop mixed leadership talent have become increasingly
recognised,  having been awarded in 2013 (for the third time) the Female
Recruiting Award from the Women & Work conference in Bonn,  Germany. 
In our newly established global internal Women Networking Groupwomen can support,  coach and advise other women,  to encourage them
to go for leadership positions. 
In addition,  we have regular events highlighting diversity as a key topice.g.  on the occasion of our 2013 Diversity Day,  addressing topics such as
'Trends for the future workplace",  'Multicultural teams",  'Why inclusion
matters" and 'LGBT inclusion[at]work".  With our participation at the
Sticks & Stones Fair in Berlin,  we stepped up our support in 2013 for the
LGBT community.  With this initiative,  the foundation was laid to build up
an LGBT network in 2014,  which will be driven by our employees.

Employee engagement measured regularly
Against the background of our Route 2015 aspirations,  we need to make
sure our workforce is engaged and motivated.  Only then can we ensure
that we will achieve our ambitious Route 2015 targets.  Our Global Human
Resources department regularly carries out employee engagement
surveys,  in order to measure the engagement and motivation of our
employees.  The results of these surveys are an important non-financial
KPI for our Group  /   INTERNAL GROUP MANAGEMENT SYSTEM,  P.  118.  They
SEE
enable us to develop the right focus and future people strategies across
our organisation. 
The adidas Group conducted its second Global Employee Engagement
Survey in 2013.  The comprehensive set of over 80 questions garnered
valuable employee feedback related to all areas of daily work life
within our organisation,  and it monitors opinions about how to make
our environment an even more engaging one.  Results have been
communicated across the Group,  first by addressing our overall results
and then cascading the results by business area.  Globally coordinated
Results to Action teams (R2A) have been formed across all departments
in order to address our employees' feedback.  The results of our first two

Sustainability
The adidas Group is responsible and accountable for developing and implementing sustainable business
practices that adhere to our operational needs as well as our social and environmental obligations.  As
 consequence,  we continuously engage with our various stakeholders in a collaborative way with the
goal of enhancing the social and environmental performance of the Group.  We believe that acting as a
good corporate citizen will improve our reputation and hence our economic value. 

Engaging with a variety of stakeholders 
  More information online 
We recognise that open and honest communication enhances the
transparency of our business and demonstrates our commitment to
being accountable.  Since 2007,  the adidas Group has disclosed its global
supplier factory list on the corporate website.  In 2013,  we disclosed the
list of factories manufacturing 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil products.  The
same was done for the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa as well as for
the London 2012 Olympic Games,  when the adidas Group became the
first Olympic partner to disclose its supply chain for the Olympic Games. 
With our regular sustainability reports,  we publicly report back on our
achievements and openly communicate where we have met targets and
when we have fallen short.

Workplace Standards set rules in the supply chain 
To illustrate how suppliers should implement our Standards,  we
have created a set of detailed guidelines for use in factory settingswhich demonstrate our expectations for fair,  healthy,  safe workplace
conditions and environmentally sound factory operations.  The guidelines
are updated on a regular basis by our Social and Environmental Affairs
(SEA) team and are publicly available.  They are also used to determine
suppliers' compliance with our Standards and to advise and train our
suppliers in improving their social and environmental performance.

We have a responsibility to our employees and the workers in our
suppliers' factories as well as the environment.  Malpractice in these
areas,  in particular human rights violations and dubious employment
practices,  can have a significant impact on the reputation and operational
efficiency of our Group and our suppliers.  Therefore,  covering labour
rights,  health and safety,  and environmental protection at our own sites
and our suppliers' factories is of the highest importance to us.  We have
defined rules and standards embedding our own corporate values as
well as those that society expects of global businesses.  These standards
follow International Labour Organization (ILO) and United Nations
conventions relating to human rights and employment practices,  as well
as the WFSGI model code of conduct.  We have condensed our rules into a
supplier code of conduct that we call our 'Workplace Standards".  These
Standards help us select manufacturing partners and serve as guiding
principles in the early identification and treatment of potential issues of
concern at our suppliers' sites. 

20

At the adidas Group,  we openly engage with numerous stakeholdersinvolving them in key social and environmental decisions that shape
day-to-day operations.  Through active participation in,  for example,  the
Better Cotton Initiative,  the Sustainable Apparel Coalition,  the Leather
Working Group and the AFIRM Working Group,  we work closely with
leading companies from a variety of sectors to develop sustainable
business approaches and to debate social and environmental topics on a
global level.  This is also supported by our membership in organisations
such as the World Federation of the Sporting Goods Industry (WFSGI)the Fair Factories Clearinghouse (FFC) and the Fair Labor Association
(FLA).  In addition,  we build awareness,  capacity and knowledge of laws
and rights among factory management and workers by partnering
with leading providers such as the EHS Academy in China and Better
Work.  For example,  inspired by a Better Work initiative,  we launched
 strategic,  industry-wide project to improve communication between
factory management and workers in our supply chain.

Encouraging self-governance
We help our core business partners in establishing management
systems with internationally recognised standards such as ISO 14001
for environmental management or OHSAS 18000 for health and safety
management systems as we believe good management systems help
factories improve their day-to-day operations and support the process
of self-governance.  By running a certified management system,  our
suppliers demonstrate commitment to continuously enhancing their
performance.  We help them build and improve human resources systems
to maintain proper working conditions,  including factory grievance
systems to routinely find and fix non-compliance issues.  Furthermoreby enforcing employment standards at the sites of our manufacturing
suppliers,  we empower workers to protect their own rights and take an
active role in decision-making. 

Training to achieve sustainable compliance

As part of the adidas Group's continuous efforts to achieve more
effective and sustainable practices within its supply chain,  the Group
has initiated a system of multi-level and cross-functional training
sessions together with its global supplier network.  Our SEA team
offers specific training courses and workshops for factory supervisors
and managers to help them apply our Standards and implement best
practices.  These workshops include,  for example,  introductory training
on our Workplace Standards and SEA operating guidelines as well as
detailed training on effective health,  safety and environmental practices. 
Furthermore,  we promote the establishment of structures that actively
involve workers and management of our suppliers,  as well as local
employee associations and non-governmental organisations (NGOs).  In
order to strengthen personnel capacities throughout our company,  our
SEA team also organises workshops for licensees,  agents and adidas
Group business entities.  In this way,  the consideration of acceptable
working conditions becomes a routine part of our business activities. 
In 2013,  the SEA team conducted 148 training sessions and workshops

The SEA team assesses compliance with the Workplace Standards by
means of factory inspections.  Our auditors check performance against a
customised risk list for each factory that is monitored.  The methodology is
linked to a factory rating which measures the effectiveness of compliance
systems and the work of their administrators.  A KPI rating tool helps
us evaluate six fundamental elements of social compliance covering
management commitment,  the quality of management systems in placeworker-management communication,  training delivered,  transparent
reporting and measurement of compliance activities.  According to the
results,  suppliers are assessed with a compliance rating (C rating) score
between 1 and 5 (with 5 being the best rating)  /  
TABLE 03.  The latest
results show that,  in 2012,  58% of our direct suppliers achieved a 3C
(good) or better rating (2011: 39%). 
Our target for 2015 is to have 60% of our direct suppliers meet a 3C
(good) rating or better under our social compliance KPI rating.  With
this approach we encourage our suppliers to take responsibility for
their own performance including reporting of key social and health
and safety indicators.  These ratings are an important non-financial
KPI for our Group  /   INTERNAL GROUP MANAGEMENT SYSTEM,  P.  118.  They
SEE
also enable us to precisely determine training needs at our suppliers'
factories.  During 2013,  we conducted 1489 factory visits (2012: 1564
visits) involving management and worker interviews,  document reviewsfacility inspections and training sessions at different levels in our supply
chain  /

Warning-letter system to enforce compliance
Where a manufacturing supplier is performing poorly in terms of
Workplace Standards compliance,  we work closely with them to find
solutions.  However,  when we find ongoing and serious instances
of non-compliance as well as a lack of commitment from factory
management to address the issues,  we send out a formal warning
letter including a notification to factory management that their business
relationship with the adidas Group is in jeopardy.  Overall,  three
warning letters result in a termination.  In 2013,  we terminated our
business relationship with 9 suppliers for compliance reasons (2012:
10 terminations). 

Strategic approach to driving environmental progress
and tackling climate change 
Improving our environmental footprint at own sites
An important part of our Group's Environmental Strategy is the Green
Company initiative,  which targets reducing the environmental footprint
of our own sites.  The initiative provides a supporting frameworkguidance and communication platform for all Group entities. 
We have set Group-wide and site-specific 2015 targets related to carbon
emissions,  savings in energy,  water and paper consumption as well as
sourcing green energy.  One of the key goals within the Green Company
initiative is to operate certified environmental management systems
at major sites of the adidas Group.  Overall,  by 2015,  we aim to reduce
the relative carbon emissions at our own sites by 30%.  By the end of
2013,  12 major sites of the adidas Group had certified environmental
management systems in place.  Around 20% of the adidas Group's
workforce is located at these sites.  Read more about the Green Company
programme and our performance achievements on our website

Tackling climate change poses a number of challenges for the adidas
Group and its manufacturing partners.  As a result of an analysis of
our environmental impacts in different areas of operation,  we have put
our Environmental Strategy in place,  which is targeted to substantially
improve our environmental footprint.  It follows a clear vision and sets
specific targets to be reached by 2015.  These targets cover corporate and
brand-related processes reaching from product design and creation to
sourcing and manufacturing through to our stores and all other points
of sale.  The focus is on energy resources,  water conservation and
discharge,  waste and chemicals,  and on becoming more thoughtful and
efficient in using resources as well as helping reduce operational costs. 
Our approach is to manage environmental issues as an integral part of
our daily operations,  positively contributing to the adidas Group's overall
business performance.  More details on our Environmental Strategy can
be found on our website at  : //

In addition to our own monitoring activities,  we value independent and
unannounced assessment by third parties to demonstrate the credibility
of and provide verified information about our programme to stakeholders. 
As a member of the Fair Labor Association (FLA),  the adidas Group is
subject to external assessment by independent monitors,  participation
in the FLA third-party complaint system and public reporting.  In 2005the monitoring programme of the adidas Group was accredited by the
FLA for the first time; re-accreditation took place in 2008.  This decision
was based on independent factory monitoring and verification reports of
supplier facilities and a thorough audit of monitoring protocols,  training
programmes and auditing systems.  Since joining the FLA,  more than
300 independent assessments have been conducted at adidas Group
suppliers.

Sustainable materials
One key goal of our Environmental Strategy is to reduce the overall
environmental impact of materials used in our products.  We aim to find
materials that reduce waste or have less of an impact throughout their
whole life cycle.  The adidas Group has various initiatives in place that
help to achieve its goal to increase the usage of recycled and sustainable
materials. 
One example is our commitment to use 100% 'sustainable cotton"
(Better Cotton,  certified organic cotton or any other form of sustainably
produced cotton that is currently available or might be in future) in all
our products by 2018.  More information about sustainable cotton can
be found on our website at  : //  
WWW. ADIDAS-GROUP. COM/EN/SUSTAINABILITY/
PRODUCTS/MATERIALS. 
Another initiative is the adidas brand's sustainable product programme
'Better Place",  which creates sustainable products within the adidas
Sport Performance and Originals & Sport Style ranges.  The product
creation process includes the utilisation of sustainable materialsenvironmental design and innovative manufacturing techniques.  The
first adidas 'Better Place" products were introduced globally in 2009 in
response to increasing consumer demand for sustainable apparel and
footwear.  These products have been a part of the adidas brand product
offering ever since. 

20

13

114

The number of adidas products that either reached or exceeded the
baseline 'Better Place" criteria has grown continuously in recent years. 
This growth is supported by ongoing innovation in the area of sustainable
product construction and manufacturing techniques,  such as the
revolutionary DryDye technology or the low-waste initiative.  DryDye is a
polyester fabric dyeing process that uses no water,  50% fewer chemicals
and 50% less energy than the traditional fabric dyeing process.  The
low-waste initiative produces footwear and sports apparel with fewer
parts,  recycled materials and maximum pattern efficiency,  aiming to
reduce material waste. 
Furthermore,  at the adidas Group,  we now increasingly use virtual
technologies to reduce the quantity of physical samples required to
design and sell new products.  Virtualising processes saves energy and
materials,  and reduces waste.  As well as being innovative,  virtualisation
is also quick and efficient.  It helps us save resources and money by
reducing material waste,  transportation and distribution costs.  And with
fewer samples being transported by airfreight,  we are also reducing our
carbon emissions. 

In 2013,  we focused on increasing the use of sustainable materials
such as recycled polyester,  organic and Better Cotton and bio-based
materials in our products.  These environmentally preferred materials
have replaced conventional materials in many of our footwear and
apparel products.  In addition to increasing the use of environmentally
preferred materials,  we strive to continuously increase the range of
more sustainable products by developing sustainable product solutions
and using innovative materials. 

Driving environmental improvements in our supply chain
In our supply chain,  activities focus on helping suppliers establish
sound environmental management systems at their manufacturing
plants to best reduce their negative environmental impacts.  We have
guidelines and training programmes in place for our suppliers,  using the
environmental performance of our own production sites as best practice
examples. 
The majority of our footwear sourcing volume is produced in factories
which are OHSAS 18000 and/or ISO 14001 certified.  The remaining
part of our footwear sourcing volume is produced in factories that
have management systems in place but have not yet been certified.  All
footwear factories are regularly assessed against the adidas Group's
standards on environment and workplace health and safety.  We use
'Environmental Key Performance Indicators" to track the progress
of environmental efforts undertaken by our strategic suppliers. 
Furthermore,  we have established a database to collect environmental
data from the factories of our core suppliers.  A range of other activities
have been implemented to reduce our carbon footprint in the supply and
distribution chain.  Examples of these are in the areas of transportation
and energy use.  In the transportation of our products,  our policy is to
minimise the impacts,  in particular from airfreight shipments,  through
improved order and production planning tools. 

Control and monitoring of restricted substances
We have specified clear standards that follow the strictest local
regulations and best practice standards for consumer care and
safety.  These standards are mandatory for all business partners and
are updated regularly based on findings in our ongoing dialogue with
scientific organisations.  They cover all general requirements for
eco-labels and green seals (e.g.  ÖKO-Tex Standard 100,  Toxproof TÜV
Rheinland,  etc. ) for footwear,  apparel and hardware products.  Both
our own quality assurance laboratories and external testing institutes
are used to constantly monitor material samples to ensure supplier
compliance with these requirements.  Materials that do not meet our
standards and specifications are rejected.

Furthermore,  it is the adidas Group's goal to work with suppliers and
the chemical industry on reducing and eliminating the discharge of
hazardous chemicals in our sphere of influence as far as possible. 
Besides our mature policies that ban or restrict chemicals in our
products,  we have also specified substances that cannot be used during
the manufacturing process because they can affect workers' health. 

Reducing VOC emissions
Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs),  which are typically found in solvents
used in our manufacturing process,  can,  in a high concentration,  cause
breathing difficulties and other health problems for production workers. 
Therefore,  for more than a decade,  we have been requesting our footwear
suppliers to significantly reduce the use of VOCs in their manufacturing.

Internal Group Management System
The principal financial goal for increasing shareholder value at the adidas Group is maximising
operating cash flow.  We strive to achieve this goal by continually improving our top- and bottom-line
performance while at the same time optimising the use of invested capital.  Our Group's planning
and controlling system is therefore designed to provide a variety of tools to assess our current
performance and to align future strategic and investment decisions to best utilise commercial and
organisational opportunities. 

Operating cash flow as Internal Group Management focus 
20

13

118

We believe operating cash flow is the most important driver to increase
shareholder value.  Operating cash flow is comprised of operating
profit,  change in operating working capital and net investments
(capital expenditure less depreciation and amortisation)  /  
DIAGRAM 01. 
To maximise operating cash flow generation across our organisationmanagement of our operating segments together with management at
market level have responsibility for improving operating profit as well as
optimising operating working capital and capital expenditure.  To keep
senior management focused on long-term performance improvementswe have adopted a modified economic value added (EVA) model.  The
net asset base of a market or operating unit within the Group is subject
to a percentage capital charge to the operating profit of the respective
business unit.  The asset base includes operating working capital as well
as other assets needed by a market or operating unit in its day-to-day
operations.  The resulting internal KPI is called Contribution After Capital
Charge (CACC) and is used as one of the primary targets for the variable
component of managers' compensation.  This concept has been in place
Group-wide since 2010. 

Operating margin as important KPI of operational
progress
Operating margin (defined as operating profit as a percentage of
net sales) is our Group's key focus measure to drive and improve
our operational performance.  It highlights the quality of our top line
and operational efficiency.  The primary drivers central to enhancing
operating margin are as follows:

/  Sales and gross margin development: Management focuses on
identifying and exploiting opportunities that not only provide for future
growth,  but also have potential to increase gross margin (defined as
gross profit as a percentage of net sales).  Major levers for enhancing our
Group's sales and gross margin include:
/ 
Optimising our product mix. 
/ 
Minimising clearance activities. 
/ 
Increasing the quality of distribution,  with a particular focus on
controlled space. 
/ 
Over-proportionate growth in emerging markets. 
/ 
Realising supply chain efficiency initiatives.

1) Capital expenditure less depreciation and amortisation. 

/  Operating expense control: We put high emphasis on tightly
controlling operating expenses to leverage the Group's sales growth
through to the bottom line.  This requires a particular focus on ensuring
flexibility in the Group's cost base.  Marketing working budget is one
of our largest operating expenses and also one of the most important
mechanisms for driving top-line growth sustainably.  Therefore,  we are
committed to improving the utilisation of our marketing expenditure.  This
includes concentrating our communication efforts (including advertisingpublic relations and digital media) on key global brand initiatives and
focusing our promotion spend on well-selected partnerships with top
events,  leagues,  clubs and athletes. 
We also aim to increase operational efficiency and reduce operating
overhead expenses as a percentage of sales.  In this respect,  we regularly
review our operational structure streamlining business processeseliminating redundancies and leveraging the scale of our organisation. 
These measures may also be supplemented by short-term initiatives
such as temporarily curtailing operational investments,  for example
staff hiring. 
Furthermore,  we carefully analyse the different mix effects which
impact the Group's profit ratios,  as our business performance differs
significantly across geographical markets,  business models and
channels.  The strategic implications and decisions taken in this respect
are a key element of our strategic planning efforts,  ensuring clarity and
focus of the organisation to maximise the Group's operating margin.

Tight operating working capital management
Due to a comparatively low level of fixed assets required in our businessthe efficiency of the Group's balance sheet depends to a large degree
on our operating working capital management.  Our key metric is
operating working capital as a percentage of net sales.  Monitoring
the development of this key metric facilitates the measurement of our
progress in improving the efficiency of our business cycle.  We have
significantly enhanced operating working capital management over
recent years through improvement of the Group's inventories,  accounts
receivable and accounts payable. 
We strive to proactively manage our inventory levels to meet market
demand and ensure fast replenishment.  Inventory ageing is controlled
tightly to reduce inventory obsolescence and to minimise clearance
activities.  As a result,  stock turn development is the key performance
indicator as it measures the number of times average inventory is sold
during a year,  highlighting the efficiency of capital locked up in products. 
To optimise capital tied up in accounts receivable,  we strive to improve
collection efforts in order to reduce the Days of Sales Outstanding (DSO)
and improve the ageing of accounts receivable.  Likewise,  we strive to
optimise payment terms with our suppliers to best manage our accounts
payable. 

Capital expenditure targeted to maximise future returns
Improving the effectiveness of the Group's capital expenditure is
another lever to maximise our operating cash flow.  We control capital
expenditure with a top-down,  bottom-up approach.  In a first stepGroup management defines focus areas and an overall investment
budget based on investment requests from various functions of the
organisation.  Our operating units then align their initiatives within the
scope of assigned priorities and available budget.  We evaluate potential
return on planned investments utilising the net present value method. 
Risk is accounted for,  adding a risk premium to the cost of capital and
thus reducing our estimated future earnings streams where appropriate. 
By means of scenario planning,  the sensitivity of investment returns is
tested against changes in initial assumptions.  For large investment
projects,  timelines and deviations versus budget are monitored on a
monthly basis throughout the course of the project. 

The final step of optimising return on investments is our selective
post-mortem reviews,  where larger projects in particular are evaluated
and learnings are documented to be available for future capital
expenditure decisions. 

M&A activities focus on long-term value
creation potential
We see the vast majority of the Group's future growth opportunities
coming from our existing portfolio of brands.  However,  as part of our
commitment to ensuring sustainable profitable development,  we
regularly review merger and acquisition (M&A) options that may provide
additional commercial and operational opportunities.  Acquisitive growth
focus is primarily related to improving the Group's positioning within
 certain sports category,  strengthening our technology portfolio or
addressing new consumer segments. 
Any potential acquisition candidate must correspond with the Group's
strategic direction.  Maximising return on invested capital above the cost
of capital in the long term is a core consideration in our decision-making
process.  Of particular importance is evaluating the potential impact
on our Group's free cash flow.  We assess current and future projected
key financial metrics to evaluate a target's operating profit potential.  In
addition,  careful consideration is given to potential financing needs and
their impact on the Group's financial leverage. 

119
13

Our Group also puts a high priority on the optimisation of non-operating
components such as financial result and taxes,  as these items strongly
impact the Group's cash outflows and therefore the Group's free cash
flow.  Financial expenses are managed centrally by our Group Treasury
department  /   TREASURY,  P.  135.  The Group's current and future tax
SEE
expenditure is optimised globally by our Group Taxes department.

Optimisation of non-operating components 
Cost of capital metric used to measure
investment potential
Creating value for our shareholders by earning a return on invested
capital above the cost of that capital is a guiding principle of our Group
strategy.  We source capital from equity and debt markets.  Therefore,  we
have a responsibility that our return on capital meets the expectations of
both equity shareholders and creditors.  We calculate the cost of capital
utilising the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) formula.  This
metric allows us to calculate the minimum required financial returns
of planned capital investments.  The cost of equity is computed utilising
the risk-free rate,  market risk premium and beta factor.  Cost of debt is
calculated using the risk-free rate,  credit spread and average tax rate.

Non-financial key performance indicators (KPIs)
In addition to the Group's financial KPIs to assess the current
performance and operational success of the adidas Group,  we have
identified a set of non-financial KPIs that help us track our progress
in areas that are critical for our long-term success but are,  howevernot directly reflected in the Group's financial statements.  These
non-financial KPIs are assessed on a regular basis and managed by the
respective Group functions.  Key non-financial KPIs include market share
and consumer insight tracking,  our customer delivery performance
(On-Time In-Full),  our employee engagement and a set of KPIs in the
area of our sustainability performance. 
Market share: Maintaining and enhancing brand image and reputation
through the creation of strong brand identities is crucial for sustaining
and driving revenue and profit growth.  It is also an important credential
as we extend our brands into new categories and regions.  Thereforemainly on a market and category level,  we invest in primary qualitative
and quantitative research such as trend scouting,  consumer surveys and
market share data to determine brand and category strength.  Measures
that are regularly tracked include market shares,  brand awarenesslikeability and purchase intent.  These efforts are supported by global

Backlogs and sell-through data: To manage demand planning and
anticipate our future performance,  backlogs comprising orders received
up to nine months in advance of the actual sale are used as a key
indicator.  However,  due to the growing share of own retail in our business
mix as well as fluctuating order patterns among our wholesale partnersour order books are less indicative of anticipated revenues compared
to the past.  Therefore,  qualitative feedback from our retail partners on
the sell-through success of our collections at the point of sale as well
as data received from our own-retail activities are becoming even more

they received it on time.  It helps our Group to investigate improvement
potential in the area of order book management and logistics processes. 
It therefore also helps us to improve our delivery performance,  which
is a major aspect when it comes to customer satisfaction.  The OTIF

Taking into account year-to-date performance as well as opportunities
and risks,  the Group's full year financial performance is forecasted on a
quarterly basis.  In this respect,  backlogs,  sell-through data,  feedback
from own-retail stores and retail partners are assessed as available. 
Finally,  as a further early indicator for future performance,  the results
of any relevant recent market and consumer research are assessed as
available. 
To ensure an effective performance measurement process at all timesin 2012 we introduced a new Group-wide management reporting
system,  enabling automated and standardised management reportingthereby combining backward- and forward-looking information from
different data sources.  Having laid the foundation in 2012,  the core
system implementation started in 2013.  The platform is used as a
major reference point on a global level,  across all markets,  functions
and brands.  It consolidates and harmonises different reporting tools
and systems within the adidas Group and enables fact-based decisionmaking on a senior management level.  In 2014,  the new reporting
system will see further enhancement,  with additional data sources and
functionalities being added. 

The whole process is set up in a rhythm and timeframe to facilitate
full cross-functional alignment and forecasting clarity in advance of
important business decision processes in particular those related
to product pricing,  range building,  material purchasing or production
capacity fixing.  To create a seamless flow between achieving our
strategic objectives and implementing operational plans,  we follow a
rolling two-year time horizon.  This ensures more focus on the mid-term
perspective,  while at the same time highlighting relevant information

We have developed an extensive performance measurement systemwhich utilises a variety of tools to measure the performance of the
adidas Group.  The Group's key financial metrics are monitored and
compared against budget as well as a rolling forecast on a monthly
basis.  The focus is on operating cash flow,  CACC,  net sales,  operating
margin,  operating working capital and net cash development  /

necessary,  action plans are implemented to optimise the development
of the Group's operating performance.  We also benchmark the Group's
financial results with those of our major competitors on a regular basis. 
To assess current sales and profitability development,  management
analyses sell-through information from our own-retail activities as well
as short-term replenishment orders from retailers.

Enhanced integrated business planning and
management approach
In order to further optimise profitability and working capital efficiency
as well as operating cash flow development,  in 2013 we continued the
Group-wide Integrated Business Planning initiative (IBP).  This initiative
focuses on developing and forming an enhanced forecasting approach
by aligning processes and timelines of major business functions such
as marketing,  sales and operations at a market and global level.  The
centre-point of this approach is to improve the reliability of future
business planning,  leading to a new efficiency level of order book
building and conversion.  This,  in turn,  is expected to lead to improving
full-margin business.

Group Business Performance
In 2013,  the adidas Group delivered a solid financial performance,  despite macroeconomic challenges
in many regions,  especially Western Europe.  Currency-neutral Group sales increased 3% as a result
of growth in Retail and Other Businesses.  In euro terms,  adidas Group revenues decreased 3% to
€ 14492 billion from € 14883 billion in 2012.  The Group's gross margin increased 15 percentage
points to 493% (2012: 477%),  driven by the positive impact from a more favourable pricing,  product
and regional sales mix as well as a larger share of higher-margin Retail sales.  The Group's gross profit
rose 1% to € 7140 billion in 2013 versus € 7103 billion in 2012.  In 2013,  the adidas Group incurred
goodwill impairment losses of € 52 million (2012: € 265 million).  These one-off expenses were
non-cash in nature and did not affect the adidas Group's liquidity.  Excluding goodwill impairment
losses,  the Group's operating profit grew 6% to € 1254 billion compared to € 1185 billion in 2012representing an operating margin of 87%,  up 07 percentage points.  This was primarily due to the
increase in gross margin,  which more than offset the negative effect from higher other operating
expenses as a percentage of sales.  Net income attributable to shareholders excluding goodwill
impairment losses was up 6% to € 839 million (2012: € 791 million).  Basic and diluted earnings per
share excluding goodwill impairment losses grew 6% to € 401 from € 378 in 2012. 

Economic and Sector Development
Global economy expands 24% in 2013

122

In 2013,  according to the World Bank,  global GDP growth moderated
slightly to 24%,  compared to 25% in the prior year.  The emerging
markets outperformed developed economies,  growing 48% and 13%respectively.  Relatively stable inflationary pressures and increases
in real disposable incomes supported consumption and GDP growthparticularly in many emerging markets,  albeit at a slightly lower rate
than that seen in previous years.  Despite improvements in economic
activity and sentiment,  many developed markets continued to face
economic challenges in 2013,  particularly in the euro area,  where low
growth and even recession in many mature economies remained as
significant negative pressure for the global economy. 
In Western Europe,  GDP growth was flat in 2013,  which was an
improvement from the contraction of 03% in the prior year.  This
reflects the overall stabilisation of the region.  However,  within the
region,  the euro area remained in recession,  with some of the union's
major economies,  such as Italy and Spain,  contracting in 2013.  This
was largely due to high unemployment levels and austerity measures
inhibiting investment,  spending and confidence.  These developments
offset modest growth in the euro area's largest economies,  Germany
and France,  where a recovery in consumer demand and spending helped
drive moderate growth. 

European emerging markets recorded positive GDP growth of around
22%,  albeit at lower levels than in recent years (2012: 27%).  This was
fuelled by robust industrial and export activity in most of the region's
markets.  Russia,  the world's largest energy exporter,  was negatively
impacted by lower growth in global demand for oil and natural gasas well as relatively high inflationary pressures which resulted in a
deceleration in consumer and investment spending.

Q4 2012

In Latin America,  GDP increased 20% (2012: 25%),  with growth
supported by low unemployment rates,  credit incentives,  a recovery
in industrial production and solid domestic consumption,  albeit
weaker than in recent years.  Investment in the urban infrastructure in
preparation for the 2014 FIFA World Cup also fuelled activity in Brazil. 
However,  increases in inflation,  particularly in Argentina,  negatively
impacted economic expansion. 

Positive momentum in the global sporting goods industry
In 2013,  the global sporting goods industry recorded solid growthprimarily driven by rising consumer spending in the emerging marketswhich more than offset subdued private spending in many Western
European markets.  The e-commerce channel continued to see rapid
expansion across the industry,  with a wide diversity of strategies being
implemented to leverage commercial opportunities through digitalsocial media and,  particularly,  mobile technologies.  The industry also
witnessed a large number of fitness-tracking devices and fitness mobile
apps coming to the market during the year.  From a category perspectivebasketball remained strong,  with both performance and lifestyle
performing well.  Running posted a solid performance,  with lightweight
and technical running continuing to record strong growth.  Howeversales trends in the lifestyle running category were low.  The build-up
to the 2014 FIFA World Cup supported the football category,  especially
towards year-end.  The outdoor category,  in both footwear and apparelfaced some headwinds at retail during the year.

Asia recorded positive GDP growth of around 43% (2012: 42%).  Excluding
Japan,  most Asian markets continued to post the highest global GDP
growth rates,  increasing 60% (2012: 60%).  China was the region's
top-performing economy,  expanding its GDP by 77% (2012: 77%)with steady momentum in its manufacturing and service sectors.  This
compared to growth of 17% in Japan,  where,  despite a slight slowdown
in the third quarter,  the economy continued to rebound.  This was fuelled
by a substantial government stimulus programme and the relatively low
value of the yen,  which assisted a recovery in export activity.  Most other
Asian economies also posted healthy GDP growth,  with strong wage
increases across most of the region helping to drive domestic demand.

The US economy grew modestly in 2013,  with GDP,  according to the
Federal Reserve,  expanding 23% compared to 18% in 2012.  Low
inflation and a recovery in the real estate market helped drive consumer
confidence and spending,  particularly in the second half of the year. 
Additionally,  robust export and industrial activity contributed positively
to economic growth.  However,  sizeable austerity measures,  higher
federal taxes and disruptions from the partial shutdown of many federal
agencies adversely impacted growth.

Modest growth of Europe's sporting goods industry
In Europe,  despite high unemployment and low consumer confidence in
many markets,  the sporting goods industry grew modestly.  The sector
faced challenging comparisons to the prior year,  which had been buoyed
by the major sporting events of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic
Games as well as the UEFA EURO 2012.  Nonetheless,  the industry gained
momentum towards year-end due to the build-up to the 2014 FIFA World
Cup in Brazil,  which helped drive sales of federation jerseys and footballrelated products.  In European emerging markets,  slower disposable
income growth rates negatively impacted consumer sentiment and
spending,  resulting in lower retail traffic in 2013,  especially in Russia. 

Robust retail activity drives North American sporting
goods industry 
20

124

In the USA,  the sporting goods industry posted a robust performancewith relatively low inflation and slight improvements in consumer
confidence helping drive consumer spending.  We estimate that sales in
the sporting goods sector increased at a mid- to high-single-digit ratedriven by improvements in product mix as retailers focused on premium
and highly innovative products.  Strong retail trends in basketballhigh-performance running and sporting lifestyle apparel more than
offset slight contractions in the lifestyle running,  outdoor and golf
categories.  Digital presence and e-commerce continued to see rapid
expansion across the industry in 2013.  Cold weather in the USA towards
year-end encouraged consumers to go online and,  in conjunction with
discounting,  added momentum to this increasingly important channel. 
US sports footwear sales are estimated to have increased at a mid- to
high-single-digit rate in 2013,  driven in particular by increases in the
basketball and high-performance running categories.  Highly innovative
performance products also fuelled growth in US sporting apparel saleswhich are estimated to have increased at a high-single-digit rate. 

Latin America's sporting goods industry records
strong momentum
In Latin America,  low unemployment levels and higher wages supported
healthy retail and sporting goods sales.  However,  high inflationary
pressures lessened the robust expansion of the sector during the year. 
Due to the importance of football for the region,  the sporting goods
sector also benefited,  principally in the second half of 2013,  from sales
relating to the build-up to the 2014 FIFA World Cup,  which is being
hosted by Brazil. 

adidas Group and competitors outperform economic
environment
adidas Group currency-neutral revenues and profitability,  as well as that
of many competitors and retailers,  increased in 2013.  In most regionssales of our Group and other major sporting goods companies grew at a
higher rate than GDP and overall consumer spending.

Asian sporting goods industry continues to expand
Strong wage increases and rising consumer spending,  albeit lower than
in recent years,  fuelled increases in Asia's sporting goods industrywhich we estimate grew at a low- to mid-single-digit rate in 2013.  The
region's industry expansion continues to be driven by international
brands.  In China,  this trend was particularly evident,  with many
domestic brands remaining focused on inventory clearance and store
network consolidation.  In Japan,  economic progress helped support
improvements in consumer spending and a recovery in retail and
sporting goods sales,  particularly in the second half of the year.

In 2013,  currency-neutral Wholesale revenues remained stable.  While
sales at Reebok grew at a low-single-digit rate,  revenues at adidas
remained at the prior year level.  Currency-neutral Retail sales increased
8% versus the prior year,  as a result of sales growth at both adidas and
Reebok.  Revenues in Other Businesses were up 5% on a currencyneutral basis,  driven by sales increases at TaylorMade-adidas GolfReebok-CCM Hockey and Rockport.  Currency translation effects had a
negative impact on segmental sales in euro terms.  Wholesale revenues
decreased 5% to € 9100 billion from € 9533 billion in 2012.  Retail sales
rose 2% to € 3446 billion versus € 3373 billion in the prior year.  Sales in
Other Businesses declined 2% to € 1946 billion (2012: € 1977 billion). 

Currency-neutral sales increase in nearly all regions
In 2013,  currency-neutral adidas Group sales grew in all regions except
Western Europe.  Revenues in Western Europe decreased 6% on a
currency-neutral basis,  mainly due to sales declines in the UK,  Italy and
Spain.  In European Emerging Markets,  Group sales increased 4% on a
currency-neutral basis as a result of sales growth in most of the region's
major markets.  Sales for the adidas Group in North America grew 2%
on a currency-neutral basis,  due to sales increases in both the USA and
Canada.  Sales in Greater China increased 7% on a currency-neutral
basis.  Currency-neutral revenues in Other Asian Markets grew 5%driven by strong increases in India,  South Korea and Australia.  In Latin
America,  sales grew 19% on a currency-neutral basis with double-digit
increases in most of the region's major markets,  in particular ArgentinaColombia and Mexico.  Currency translation effects had a negative impact

Cost of sales is defined as the amount we pay to third parties for expenses
associated with producing and delivering our products.  Own-production
expenses are also included in the Group's cost of sales.  However,  these
expenses represent only a very small portion of total cost of sales.  In
2013,  cost of sales was € 7352 billion,  representing a decrease of 5%
compared to € 7780 billion in 2012.  This development was driven by the
reduction of input costs as a result of lower raw material prices at the
time of sourcing.  In addition,  currency effects contributed to the decline
in cost of sales.

Group gross margin increases 15 percentage points 
In 2013,  Group sales grew in most product categories on a currencyneutral basis.  Currency-neutral footwear sales increased 4% in 2013. 
This development was mainly driven by double-digit growth in the
running and outdoor categories.  Action Sports as well as the adidas
NEO label also grew at a double-digit rate.  Apparel revenues decreased
3% on a currency-neutral basis,  as growth in running,  football and
basketball was more than offset by declines in categories closely
related to prior year events,  such as Olympic sports.  Currency-neutral
hardware sales increased 15% compared to the prior year,  primarily
due to strong growth in the football category.  In addition,  the first-time
consolidation of Adams Golf at the end of the second quarter of 2012
positively contributed to this development.  Currency translation effects
had a negative impact on sales in euro terms  /

Sales working budget as a percentage of sales increases
Sales working budget consists of expenses to support the Group's
sell-through development.  Expenditures relate to advertising and
promotion initiatives at the point of sale as well as store furniture and
fixtures.  As sales working budget expenses are channel specific,  they
are allocated to the Group's operating segments.  In absolute termssales working budget expenditure increased 12% to € 340 million in
2013 from € 304 million in the prior year.  This development was mainly
 result of higher expenditure related to the expansion of the Group's
own-retail activities.  By brand,  adidas sales working budget increased
15% to € 253 million compared to € 220 million in the prior year.  Sales
working budget for Reebok grew 7% to € 53 million at year-end (2012:
€ 50 million).  The Group's sales working budget as a percentage of sales
increased 03 percentage points to 23% (2012: 20%)  /

Marketing working budget consists of items such as expenses for
promotion partnerships,  advertising and public relations.  As marketing
working budget expenses are not distribution channel specific,  they are
not allocated to the segments.  In absolute terms,  marketing working
budget decreased 3% to € 1457 billion in 2013 (2012: € 1502 billion)
due to lower expenditure at both adidas and Reebok.  By brand,  the
adidas marketing working budget decreased 1% to € 1147 billion
from € 1157 billion in 2012.  Marketing working budget of the Reebok
brand was down 20% to € 150 million (2012: € 188 million).  The Group's
marketing working budget as a percentage of sales remained stable at
101% (2012: 101%)  /  
DIAGRAM 21. 

Operating overhead expenses as a percentage of sales
increase 07 percentage points
Group operating overheads include overhead costs related to marketinglogistics,  sales and R&D as well as central administration.  Almost half
of the operating overhead expenses are related to personnel costs. 
In absolute terms,  operating overhead expenses remained stable at
€ 4336 billion in 2013 versus € 4344 billion in 2012.  This was primarily
 result of a decrease in marketing costs,  partly offset by an increase
in logistics and warehouse costs.  As a percentage of sales,  operating
overhead expenses grew 07 percentage points to 299% (2012: 292%).

At the end of December 2013,  the Group employed 50728 people.  This
represents an increase of 10% versus the prior year level of 46306.  New
hirings related to the expansion of the Group's own-retail store base,  in
particular in European Emerging Markets,  were the main driver of this
development.  On a full-time equivalent basis,  the number of employees
increased 8% to 43537 at the end of 2013 (2012: 40168)  /   EMPLOYEESSEE
P.  105. 

EBITDA grows 5%
The Group's earnings before interest,  taxes,  depreciation and amortisation
as well as impairment losses/reversal of impairment losses on propertyplant and equipment and intangible assets (EBITDA) increased 5% to
€ 1523 billion in 2013 (2012: € 1445 billion)  /  
DIAGRAM 22.  Depreciation
and amortisation expense for tangible and intangible assets (excluding
impairment losses/reversal of impairment losses) increased 9% to
€ 286 million in 2013 (2012: € 263 million).  This development is mainly
due to an increase in property,  plant and equipment.  In accordance
with IFRS,  intangible assets with indefinite useful lives (goodwill and
trademarks) are tested annually and additionally when there are
indications of potential impairment.  In this connection,  impairment of
intangible assets with unlimited useful lives was incurred in 2013. 

Operating margin excluding goodwill impairment
improves to 87%
Group operating profit increased 31% to € 1202 billion in 2013 versus
€ 920 million in 2012.  The operating margin of the adidas Group
improved 21 percentage points to 83% (2012: 62%).  Excluding the
goodwill impairment losses,  operating profit grew 6% to € 1254 billion
from € 1185 billion last year  /  
DIAGRAM 23,  representing an operating
margin of 87%,  up 07 percentage points (2012: 80%)  /  
DIAGRAM 25.  This
is below our initial expectations of an operating margin approaching
90%.  The improvement in the operating margin was primarily due to
the positive effects from the increase in gross margin,  which more than
offset higher other operating expenses as a percentage of sales. 

Financial income down 28%
Financial income decreased 28% to € 26 million in 2013 from € 36 million
in the prior year,  mainly due to a decrease in interest income  /   NOTE

Goodwill impairment in an amount of € 52 million
As a result of the annual impairment test,  the adidas Group has
impaired goodwill and recorded a € 52 million pre-tax charge as
at December 31,  2013 (2012: € 265 million).  Within the wholesale
cash-generating unit Iberia,  goodwill impairment losses of € 23 million
were recognised.  Within the retail cash-generating unit North Americagoodwill impairment losses of € 29 million were recognised.  The
goodwill of these two cash-generating units is completely impaired. 
The impairment losses were mainly caused by adjusted growth
assumptions and an increase in the country-specific discount rates.  In
2012,  the wholesale cash-generating unit North America was impaired
by € 106 million,  Latin America by € 41 million,  Brazil by € 15 million
and Iberia by € 11 million.  The impairment loss in 2012 was mainly the
result of adjusted growth assumptions for the Reebok brand,  especially
in North America,  Latin America and Brazil,  and an increase in the
country-specific discount rates as a result of the euro crisis.  In additionin 2012 goodwill of € 68 million allocated to Reebok-CCM Hockey was
completely impaired and € 24 million allocated to Rockport was partially
impaired.  These impairment losses were primarily the result of the
re-evaluation of future growth prospects and,  with regard to Rockportalso due to an increase in the discount rate.  The impairment losses in
both years were non-cash in nature and do not affect the adidas Group's
liquidity  /   NOTE 02,  P.  195.

provisions were down 20% to € 450 million at the end of 2013 versus

Operating working capital increased 10% to € 2618 billion at the end of

was due to the increase in inventories related to the Group's expectations
for growth in the coming quarters as well as higher inventories in
Russia/CIS following distribution centre issues during the second
half of 2013.  Higher receivables reflecting the growth of our business
during the fourth quarter of 2013 also contributed to the increase in
operating working capital.  As a result,  average operating working

Investment analysis 
42   /   Capital expenditure by segment 
Capital expenditure is defined as the total cash expenditure for the
purchase of tangible and intangible assets (excluding acquisitions). 
Group capital expenditure increased 10% to € 479 million in 2013 (2012:
€ 434 million).  Capital expenditure in property,  plant and equipment
amounted to € 427 million and was thus above the prior year level of
€ 376 million.  The Group invested € 52 million in intangible assetsrepresenting a 10% decrease compared to the prior year (2012:
€ 58 million).  Depreciation and amortisation excluding impairment
losses/reversal of impairment losses of tangible and intangible assets
increased 9% to € 286 million in 2013 (2012: € 263 million).

The majority of the Group's capital expenditure was recorded in HQ/
Consolidation,  accounting for 52% (2012: 58%),  and was mainly related
to investments in the Group's logistics infrastructure and deployment
of IT systems  /  
DIAGRAM 42.  The Retail segment accounted for 29% of
the Group's capital expenditure (2012: 24%).  Investments primarily
related to the expansion of our store base for the adidas and Reebok
brands,  particularly in Russia/CIS.  Expenditure in the Wholesale
segment accounted for 13% of total capital expenditure (2012: 12%). 
Capital expenditure in Other Businesses accounted for 6% of total
expenditure (2012: 6%).  From a regional perspective,  capital expenditure
in Western Europe accounted for 41% (2012: 45%) of the Group's capital
expenditure,  followed by European Emerging Markets with 17% (2012:

In 2013,  net cash generated from operating activities decreased 33%
to € 634 million (2012: € 942 million),  primarily due to higher working
capital requirements.  Net cash used in investing activities increased 12%
to € 243 million (2012: € 217 million).  The majority of investing activities
in 2013 related to spending for property,  plant and equipment,  such as
investments in the furnishing and fitting of stores in our Retail segment
as well as investments in the Group's logistics infrastructure and IT
systems.  These were partly offset by the sale of short-term financial
assets.  Net cash used in financing activities totalled € 439 million (2012:
net cash generated from financing activities of € 42 million).  Cash used
in financing activities mainly related to dividends paid to shareholders
of € 282 million for the 2012 financial year as well as the repayment
of short-term borrowings of € 221 million.  Exchange rate effects
negatively impacted the Group's cash position by € 35 million in 2013
(2012: € 3 million).  As a result of all these developments,  cash and
cash equivalents decreased € 83 million to € 1587 billion at the end

Group financing policy
In order to be able to meet the Group's payment commitments at all
times,  the major goal of our financing policy is to ensure sufficient
liquidity reserves,  while at the same time minimising the Group's
financial expenses.  The operating activities of our Group segments and
markets and the resulting cash inflows represent the Group's main
source of liquidity.  Liquidity is planned on a rolling monthly basis under
 multi-year financial and liquidity plan.  This comprises all consolidated
Group companies.  Our in-house bank concept takes advantage of any
surplus funds of individual Group companies to cover the financial
requirements of others,  thus reducing external financing needs
and optimising our net interest expenses.  By settling intercompany
transactions via intercompany financial accounts,  we are able to reduce
external bank account transactions and thus bank charges.  Effective
management of our currency exposure and interest rate risks are
additional goals and responsibilities of our Group Treasury department. 

Treasury system and responsibilities
Our Group's Treasury Policy governs all treasury-related issuesincluding banking policy and approval of bank relationships,  financing
arrangements and liquidity/asset management,  currency and interest
risk management as well as the management of intercompany cash
flows.  Responsibilities are arranged in a three-tiered approach:
/  Treasury Committee consists of members of the Executive Board
The
and other senior executives who decide on the Group's Treasury
Policy and provide strategic guidance for managing treasury-related
topics.  Major changes to our Treasury Policy are subject to the prior
approval of the Treasury Committee. 
/ The Group Treasury department is responsible for specific centralised
treasury transactions and for the global implementation of our
Group's Treasury Policy. 
/  a subsidiary level,  where applicable and economically reasonableOn
local managing directors and financial controllers are responsible
for managing treasury matters in their respective subsidiaries. 
Controlling functions on a Group level ensure that the transactions
of the individual business units are in compliance with the Group's
Treasury Policy.

In accordance with our Group's Treasury Policy,  all worldwide credit lines
are directly or indirectly managed by the Group Treasury department. 
Portions of those lines are allocated to the Group's subsidiaries
and backed by adidas AG guarantees.  As a result of this centralised
liquidity management,  the Group is well positioned to allocate
resources efficiently throughout the organisation.  The Group's debt is
generally unsecured and may include standard financial covenantswhich are reviewed on a quarterly basis.  We maintain good relations
with numerous partner banks,  thereby avoiding a high dependency
on any single financial institution.  Banking partners of the Group
and our subsidiaries are required to have at least a BBB+ long-term
investment grade rating by Standard & Poor's or an equivalent rating
by another leading rating agency.  Only in exceptional cases are Group
companies authorised to work with banks with a lower rating /  
SEE
RISK AND OPPORTUNITY REPORT,  P.  158.  To ensure optimal allocation of the
Group's liquid financial resources,  subsidiaries transfer excess cash
to the Group's headquarters in all instances where it is legally and
economically feasible.  In addition,  Group Treasury is currently rolling
out a global standardisation and consolidation of cash management and
payment processes,  including the set-up of automated,  cross-border
cash pools,  a payment factory and a new in-house bank concept.  While
2013 has seen the core implementation of standardised and consolidated
cash management and payment processes,  these functionalities will be
further rolled out in the course of 2014.

Remaining time to maturity of gross borrowings 

In the case of our committed credit facilities,  we have entered into various
covenants.  These covenants may include limits on the disposal of fixed
assets,  the amount of debt secured by liens,  cross default provisions and
change of control.  In addition,  certain financial arrangements contain
equity ratio covenants,  minimum equity covenants as well as net loss
covenants.  If we failed to meet any covenant and were unable to obtain
 waiver from a majority of partner banks,  borrowings would become
due and payable immediately.  As at December 31,  2013,  we were in
full compliance with all of our covenants,  with ample coverage above
all stipulated minimum requirements.  As a result of our cash flow
expectations,  we are fully confident we will continue to be compliant with
these covenants going forward /   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS AND OUTLOOKSEE

Effective currency management a key priority 
20

138

As a globally operating company,  the adidas Group is exposed to currency
risks.  Therefore,  effective currency management is a key focus of Group
Treasury,  with the aim of reducing the impact of currency fluctuations on
non-euro-denominated net future cashflows.  In this regard,  hedging US
dollars is a central part of our programme.  This is a direct result of the
Group's Asian-dominated sourcing,  which is largely denominated in US
dollars  /   GLOBAL OPERATIONS,  P.  94.  In 2013,  Group Treasury managed
SEE
 net deficit of around US $ 52 billion related to operational activities
(2012: US $ 51 billion).  Thereof,  around US $ 26 billion was against the
euro (2012: US $ 27 billion).  As governed by the Group's Treasury Policywe have established a rolling 12- to 24-month hedging system,  under
which the vast majority of the anticipated seasonal hedging volume is
secured approximately six months prior to the start of a season.  As a
result,  we have almost completed our anticipated hedging needs for
2014 as of year-end 2013 and have already started hedging our exposure
for 2015.  In 2014,  the positive effect from a more favourable EUR/USD
conversion rate will be more than offset by less favourable conversion
rates in emerging markets and Japan.  The use or combination of different
hedging instruments,  such as forward contracts,  currency options and
swaps,  protects us against unfavourable currency movements.  The use
of currency options allows the Group to benefit from future favourable
exchange rate developments  /   RISK AND OPPORTUNITY REPORT,  P.  158.

(343)

The majority of the operating business of adidas AG consists of the sale
of merchandise to retailers and own-retail activities. 

Depreciation and amortisation 
In addition to its own trading activities,  the results of adidas AG are
significantly influenced by its holding function for the adidas Group.  This
is reflected primarily in currency effects,  transfer of costs for services
provided,  interest result and income from investments in affiliated
companies. 

The asset and capital structure of adidas AG is significantly impacted
by its holding and financing function for the Group.  For example,  52% of
total assets in 2013 related to financial assets,  which primarily consist
of shares in affiliated companies.  Intercompany accounts,  through
which transactions between affiliated companies are settled,  represent
another 28% of total assets and 45% of total liabilities and equity as at
December 31,  2013.

Sales of adidas AG comprise external revenues from adidas and Reebok
product sales generated by adidas Germany,  external revenues from Y-3
products as well as Group-internal revenues from foreign subsidiaries. 
Reported revenues also include royalty and commission income,  mainly
from affiliated companies,  and other revenues.  In 2013,  adidas AG net
sales decreased 2% to € 1954 billion (2012: € 2004 billion).  This decline
is mainly attributable to a decrease in royalty income from affiliated
companies and to slightly lower sales at adidas Germany  /

Balance Sheet

Other operating expenses decrease 4%
In 2013,  other operating expenses of adidas AG declined 4% to
€ 1981 billion (2012: € 2055 billion).  This decrease was largely
due to a decline in losses from currency translation and lower legal
and consultancy expenses,  which more than offset an increase in
expenditure,  in particular for marketing.

Financial result decreases 
Total assets decline 5%

The financial result of adidas AG declined 88% to € 43 million in 2013
from € 350 million in 2012.  This strong decrease is attributable to
lower profit transfers from affiliated companies under profit and loss
transfer agreements.  In 2013,  profit transfers decreased € 330 million
to € 6 million (2012: € 336 million).  Income from investments in affiliated
companies increased 19% to € 102 million in 2013 (2012: € 86 million). 

At the end of December 2013,  total assets decreased 5% to € 6694 billion
compared to € 7030 billion in the prior year.  This was mainly a result of
 decrease in cash and cash equivalents,  which declined € 312 million.

Shareholders' equity 
In 2013,  profit from operations decreased 27% to € 168 million (2012:
€ 231 million).  This was mainly due to the decline in other operating
income as well as the increase in depreciation and amortisation and
personnel expenses. 

Net interest expense of adidas AG declined 14% to € 62 million in 2013
(2012: € 72 million).  This development was mainly due to lower interest
paid to affiliated companies. 

Net income down
Income from ordinary activities declined 64% to € 211 million in 2013
from € 581 million in 2012.  This development is attributable to the
decline in the financial result and the lower profit from operations.  Net
income for the year after taxes of € 111 million was € 100 million (2012:
€ 504 million). 

Shareholders' equity down 7%
Shareholders' equity declined 7% to € 2489 billion at the end of
December 2013 compared to € 2672 billion in the prior year.  This
decrease was mainly due to lower net income in 2013 compared to the
dividend payout for 2012.  Taking into account the dividend distribution
from the prior year retained earnings and net income generated for the
year,  the equity ratio remained relatively stable at 37%. 

Provisions up 9%
Provisions increased 9% to € 393 million at the end of 2013 (2012:
€ 361 million).

Liabilities and other items decreased 5% to € 3812 billion at the end
of 2013 (2012: € 3997 billion).  This decline primarily resulted from a

Cash inflow from operating activities reflects net income 
Composition of subscribed capital 
adidas AG generated a positive cash flow from operating activities
of € 89 million (2012: € 665 million).  The change versus the prior
year was mainly a result of lower net income and lower payables to
affiliated companies.  Net cash outflow from investment activities was
€ 115 million (2012: € 128 million).  This is largely attributable to capital
expenditure for tangible and intangible fixed assets of € 116 million. 
Financing activities resulted in a cash outflow of € 287 million (2012:
cash inflow of € 128 million).  The net cash outflow from financing
activities relates to the dividend payment of € 282 million.  As a result
of all these developments,  cash and cash equivalents of adidas AG
decreased € 312 million to € 736 million at the end of December 2013
compared to € 1048 billion at the end of December 2012. 

The nominal capital of adidas AG amounts to € 209216186 (as at
December 31,  2013) and is divided into the same number of registered
no-par-value shares with a pro-rata amount in the nominal capital of
€ 1 each ('shares").  As at December 31,  2013,  adidas AG does not hold
any treasury shares  /   NOTE 25,  P.  217.  Pursuant to § 4 section 8 of the
SEE
Articles of Association,  shareholders' claims to the issuance of individual
share certificates are,  in principle,  excluded.  Each share grants one vote
at the Annual General Meeting.  All shares carry the same rights and
obligations. 

adidas AG is able to meet its financial commitments at all times. 

Restrictions on voting rights or transfer of shares
We are not aware of any contractual agreements with adidas AG or other
agreements restricting voting rights or the transfer of shares.  Based on
the Code of Conduct of adidas AG,  however,  particular lock-up periods
do exist for members of the Executive Board with regard to the purchase
and sale of adidas AG shares.  These lock-up periods are connected with
the publication of quarterly and full year results.  Such lock-up periods
also exist for employees who have access to yet unpublished financial
results. 
In addition,  restrictions of voting rights may exist pursuant,  inter aliato § 136 German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz AktG) or for
treasury shares pursuant to § 71b AktG as well as due to capital market
regulations,  in particular pursuant to §§ 21 et seq.  German Securities
Trading Act (Wertpapierhandelsgesetz WpHG). 

Shareholdings in share capital exceeding 10% of

We have not been notified of,  and are not aware of,  any direct or indirect

There are no shares bearing special rights.  In particular,  there are no

Voting right control if employees have a share
in the capital 
Authorisation of the Executive Board to issue shares 
Like all other shareholders,  employees who hold adidas AG shares
exercise their control rights directly in accordance with statutory
provisions and the Articles of Association. 

The authorisations of the Executive Board are regulated by §§ 76 et seq. 
AktG in conjunction with § 7 of the Articles of Association.  The Executive
Board is responsible,  in particular,  for managing the company and
represents the company judicially and extra-judicially. 

Executive Board appointment and dismissal 
The authorisation of the Executive Board to issue shares is regulated by
§ 4 of the Articles of Association and by statutory provisions:

Pursuant to § 6 of the Articles of Association and § 84 AktG,  the
Supervisory Board is responsible for determining the exact number of
members of the Executive Board,  for their appointment and dismissal
as well as for the appointment of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO).  The
adidas AG Executive Board,  which,  as a basic principle,  comprises at
least two members,  currently consists of the CEO as well as four further
members  /   EXECUTIVE BOARD,  P.  36.  Executive Board members may
SEE
be appointed for a maximum period of five years.  Such appointments
may be renewed and the terms of office may be extended,  provided that
no term exceeds five years. 

20

13

142

The Supervisory Board may revoke the appointment of an individual
as member of the Executive Board or CEO for good cause,  such as
gross negligence of duties or a vote of no confidence by the Annual
General Meeting.  As adidas AG is subject to the regulations of the
German Co-Determination Act (Mitbestimmungsgesetz MitbestG)the appointment of Executive Board members and also their dismissal
requires a majority of at least two thirds of the Supervisory Board
members (§ 31 MitbestG).  If such a majority is not established in the first
vote by the Supervisory Board,  the Mediation Committee has to present
 proposal which,  however,  does not exclude other proposals.  The
appointment or dismissal is then made in a second vote with a simple
majority of the votes cast by the Supervisory Board members.  Should
the required majority not be established in this case either,  a third voteagain requiring a simple majority,  must be held in which,  however,  the
Chairman of the Supervisory Board has two votes. 
Furthermore,  the Fuerth,  Germany,  local court shall,  pursuant to § 85
section 1 AktG,  in urgent cases,  make the necessary appointment upon
application by any party involved,  if the Executive Board does not have
the required number of members. 

Amendments to the Articles of Association
Pursuant to § 179 section 1 sentence 1 AktG,  the Articles of Association
of adidas AG can,  in principle,  only be amended by a resolution passed
by the Annual General Meeting.  Pursuant to § 21 section 3 of the Articles
of Association in conjunction with § 179 section 2 sentence 2 AktGthe Annual General Meeting of adidas AG principally resolves upon
amendments to the Articles of Association with a simple majority of the
votes cast and with a simple majority of the nominal capital represented
when passing the resolution.  If mandatory legal provisions stipulate
 larger majority of voting rights or capital,  this is applicable.  When it
comes to amendments solely relating to the wording,  the Supervisory
Board is,  however,  authorised to make these modifications in accordance
with § 179 section 1 sentence 2 AktG in conjunction with § 10 section 1 of
the Articles of Association. 

Authorised Capital
/ 
Until June 30,  2016,  the Executive Board is authorised to increase the
nominal capital,  subject to Supervisory Board approval,  by issuing
new shares against contributions in kind once or several times by no
more than € 25000000 altogether (Authorised Capital 2013/II). 

/ 
Until June 30,  2018,  the Executive Board is authorised to increase the
nominal capital,  subject to Supervisory Board approval,  by issuing
new shares against contributions in cash once or several times by no
more than € 50000000 altogether (Authorised Capital 2013/I). 
/ 
Until June 30,  2018,  the Executive Board is authorised to increase the
nominal capital,  subject to Supervisory Board approval,  by issuing
new shares against contributions in cash once or several times by
no more than € 20000000 altogether (Authorised Capital 2013/III). 
Subject to Supervisory Board approval,  shareholders' subscription
rights may be excluded in certain cases for each of the above-mentioned
authorisations  /   NOTE 25,  P.  217. 
SEE
Contingent Capital
/ 
Based on the resolution of the Annual General Meeting of May 62010,  the Executive Board is authorised,  subject to Supervisory Board
approval,  to issue bonds with warrants and/or convertible bonds by
the company or affiliated companies once or several times in the total
amount of up to € 15 billion,  with or without a limited term,  against
contributions in cash and to accept guarantee of such bonds issued
by affiliated companies until May 5,  2015.  Furthermore,  the Executive
Board is authorised,  subject to Supervisory Board approval,  to grant
to bondholders or bond creditors subscription or conversion rights
relating to no more than a total of 36000000 shares in compliance
with the corresponding conditions of the bonds. 
For this purpose,  the nominal capital was conditionally increased by
up to € 36000000 (Contingent Capital 2010).  The Executive Board
is authorised,  subject to Supervisory Board approval,  to exclude
shareholders' subscription rights for fractional amounts.  The
authorisation also provides for excluding shareholders' subscription
rights insofar as this is necessary for granting subscription rights
to which holders or creditors of bonds already issued before are
entitled.  Furthermore,  the Executive Board is authorised,  subject
to Supervisory Board approval,  to also exclude shareholders'
subscription rights if the issue price of the bonds is not significantly
below the market value of these bonds and the number of shares to
be issued does not exceed 10% of the nominal capital.  The issuance of
new shares or the use of treasury shares must be taken into account
when calculating the limit of 10% in certain specific cases.

On March 14,  2012,  following the approval of the Supervisory Boardthe Executive Board issued a convertible bond,  excluding shareholders'
subscription rights,  thus making partial use of the authorisation granted
by the Annual General Meeting on May 6,  2010.  For the issuance of
shares to bondholders,  the Contingent Capital 2010 may be utilised. 
However,  the shares will only be issued insofar as bondholders make
use of their conversion rights.  The total number of shares to be issued
to bondholders in case of full conversion currently amounts to up to
6016954 shares. 

Furthermore,  the shares may be assigned to members of the Executive
Board as compensation by way of a stock bonus subject to the provision
that resale by the Executive Board members shall only be permitted
following a retention period of at least three years from the date of
assignment.  Responsibility in this case lies with the Supervisory Board. 
In case of utilisation of shares for the above-mentioned purposes,  except
for the cancellation of shares,  shareholders' subscription rights are
excluded. 
The Supervisory Board may determine that transactions based on this
authorisation may only be carried out subject to the approval of the
Supervisory Board or one of its committees. 

The repurchase via the stock exchange will be carried out through a
public repurchase offer,  through a public invitation to submit sale offers
or through granting tender rights to shareholders.  Furthermore,  the
authorisation sets out the lowest and highest nominal value that may be
granted in each case. 

/  In the scope of the authorisation resolved by the Annual General
Meeting on May 6,  2010,  the Executive Board is furthermore authorised
to conduct the share buyback also by using equity derivatives which are
arranged with a financial institution in close conformity with market
conditions.  adidas AG may acquire call options issued for physical delivery
and/or sell put options or use a combination of call and put options
or other equity derivatives if the option conditions ensure that these
shares are only delivered if they were purchased in compliance with the
equality principle.  All share purchases using the aforementioned equity
derivatives are limited to a maximum value of 5% of the nominal capital
existing at the date on which the resolution was adopted by the Annual
General Meeting (or,  as the case may be,  a lower amount of nominal
capital at the date of utilisation of the authorisation).  The term of the
options may not exceed 18 months and must furthermore be chosen in
such a way that the shares are acquired upon the exercise of the options
no later than May 5,  2015.  The authorisation furthermore sets out the
lowest and highest nominal value that may be granted in each case. 

The purposes for which adidas AG shares repurchased based on this
authorisation may be used are set out in Item 11 of the Agenda for
the Annual General Meeting held on May 6,  2010.  The shares may in
particular be used as follows:

For excluding subscription rights as well as for the use and cancellation
of shares purchased using equity derivatives,  the general provisions
adopted by the Annual General Meeting (set out above) are applicable
accordingly. 

/  Until May 5,  2015,  the Executive Board is authorised to repurchase
adidas AG shares of up to an amount totalling 10% of the nominal capital
at the date of the resolution (or,  as the case may be,  a lower amount
of nominal capital at the date of utilisation of the authorisation) for any
lawful purpose and within the legal framework.  The authorisation may
be used by the company but also by its subsidiaries or by third parties on
account of the company or its subsidiaries or third parties assigned by
the company or one of its subsidiaries. 

/ 
They may be sold via the stock exchange,  through a public share
purchase offer made to all shareholders or sold otherwise against
cash (limited to 10% of the nominal capital taking into account certain
offsets) at a price not significantly below the stock market price of
shares with the same features. 
/ 
They may be offered and assigned as consideration for the direct or
indirect acquisition of companies,  parts of companies or participations
in companies or within the scope of company mergers. 
/ 
They may be offered and sold as consideration for the acquisition
of industrial property rights or intangible property rights or for
the acquisition of licences relating to such rights,  also through
subsidiaries. 
/ 
They may be used for purposes of meeting the subscription or
conversion rights or obligations or the company's right to delivery of
shares arising from bonds with warrants and/or convertible bonds. 
/ 
They may be cancelled without the cancellation,  or the execution
thereof,  requiring an additional resolution of the Annual General
Meeting. 

Change of control/compensation agreements
Material agreements entered into by adidas AG containing a change-ofcontrol clause relate to financing agreements.  In the case of a change
of control,  these agreements,  in accordance with common practiceentitle the creditor to termination and early calling-in of any outstanding
amounts. 
No compensation agreements exist between adidas AG and members of
the Executive Board or employees relating to the event of a takeover bid.

In 2013,  currency-neutral sales for the Wholesale segment increased
in all regions except Western Europe and North America.  Currencyneutral revenues in Western Europe decreased 9%,  mainly due to sales
declines in the UK,  Italy and Spain.  Currency-neutral sales in European
Emerging Markets rose 8%,  as a result of growth in most of the region's
major markets.  Currency-neutral Wholesale sales in North America
were down 3% due to declines in the USA.  Revenues in Greater China
increased 7% on a currency-neutral basis.  Sales in Other Asian Markets
grew 5% on a currency-neutral basis,  driven by strong increases in
South Korea,  India and Australia.  In Latin America,  currency-neutral
sales were up 16%,  supported by double-digit sales growth in most of
the region's major markets.  Currency translation effects had a negative
impact on regional sales in euro terms  /

In 2013,  adidas Sport Performance wholesale revenues grew 1% on a
currency-neutral basis.  Growth was mainly a result of sales increases
in the training,  running,  football and outdoor categories,  partly offset
by declines in categories closely related to prior year major sporting
events,  such as Olympic sports.  Currency translation effects had a
negative impact on revenues in euro terms.  adidas Sport Performance

Currency-neutral adidas Originals & Sport Style wholesale revenues
grew 2% in 2013.  This increase was driven by double-digit sales growth
at the adidas NEO label.  Currency translation effects had a negative
impact on revenues in euro terms.  adidas Originals & Sport Style sales
decreased 2% to € 2156 billion (2012: € 2193 billion). 
In 2013,  Reebok wholesale revenues increased 1% on a currency-neutral
basis,  mainly due to growth in the classics,  fitness training and studio
categories.  This development was partly offset by the negative impact of
the discontinuation of the NFL licence agreement.  Currency translation
effects had a negative impact on revenues in euro terms.  Reebok sales
were down 5% to € 1050 billion (2012: € 1109 billion).

Retail full year results 
2013

In 2013,  Retail revenues increased 8% on a currency-neutral basis as
 result of high-single-digit sales growth at adidas.  Currency-neutral
sales at Reebok grew at a low-single-digit rate.  Concept storesfactory outlets and concession corners were all up versus the prior
year.  eCommerce grew 64% on a currency-neutral basis.  Currency
translation effects negatively impacted segmental revenues in euro
terms.  Sales grew 2% to € 3446 billion from € 3373 billion in the prior
year  /  
TABLE 08.  Currency-neutral comparable store sales decreased 1%
versus the prior year,  as growth in most regions was more than offset
by sales declines in Russia/CIS.  This development was mainly due to a
challenging consumer environment in Russia/CIS as well as distribution
centre issues during the year. 
Gross margin in the Retail segment increased 13 percentage points to
622% from 609% in 2012.  The positive effect from a more favourable
pricing and product mix contributed to the margin increase.  By brandthe adidas gross margin was up 10 percentage points to 631% (2012:
621%) and Reebok's gross margin increased 23 percentage points to
574% (2012: 551%).  Retail gross profit rose 4% to € 2143 billion from
€ 2055 billion in 2012  /

Segmental operating expenses as a percentage of sales grew
30 percentage points to 425% (2012: 395%).  Segmental operating
expenses in Retail primarily relate to personnel and rent expenses
as well as the sales working budget.  Segmental operating expenses
increased 10% to € 1465 billion from € 1331 billion in 2012.  This
was mainly a result of higher expenses related to the expansion of the
Group's store base,  particularly in European Emerging Markets. 
Segmental operating profit decreased 6% to € 678 million versus
€ 724 million in the prior year.  Segmental operating margin decreased

Retail development by region
Currency-neutral Retail sales increased in all regions.  Retail revenues
in Western Europe grew 8% on a currency-neutral basis,  mainly due
to double-digit sales increases in Germany,  the UK and Italy.  Sales in
European Emerging Markets rose 2% on a currency-neutral basis,  as a
result of growth in most of the region's major markets.  Currency-neutral
Retail sales in North America grew 10% due to double-digit growth in
the USA and Canada.  Retail revenues in Greater China increased 11%
on a currency-neutral basis.  Sales in Other Asian Markets grew 8% on a

Subsequent Events and Outlook
In 2014,  despite a high degree of economic uncertainty particularly in the emerging markets,  we
expect the global economy and consumer spending to increase,  providing a positive backdrop for the
continued growth and expansion of the sporting goods industry.  Through the extensive pipeline of new
and innovative products at all brands and the positive effects from major sporting events including the
2014 FIFA World Cup,  we project top- and bottom-line improvements in our Group's financial results
in 2014.  We forecast adidas Group sales to increase at a high-single-digit rate on a currency-neutral
basis,  with growth expected at all brands as well as in all regions and segments.  Currency translation
is expected to have a significant negative impact on our top-line development in reported terms.  Group
gross margin is forecasted to increase to a level between 495% and 498%,  primarily as a result of
 more favourable pricing,  product and regional sales mix,  as well as improvements at the Reebok
brand.  Group operating margin is forecasted to be at a level between 85% and 90%.  As a result,  we
project net income attributable to shareholders to be at a level between € 830 million and € 930 million. 

Subsequent Events 
No other subsequent changes 
Subsequent management changes on the Executive Board 
Since the end of 2013,  there have been no other significant organisationsocio-political,  legal or financial changes which we expect to influence
our business materially going forward. 

Subsequent macroeconomic developments
Since the end of 2013,  several currencies,  in particular the Argentine
peso,  Brazilian real,  Turkish lira,  Russian rouble,  Australian dollar
and Canadian dollar,  amongst others,  have further depreciated versus
the euro.  These changes currently add significant risk to our Group's
reported results in euro due to negative currency translation effects.

Global economy to grow in 2014
According to the World Bank,  global GDP is projected to increase 32%
in 2014 (2013: 24%).  While several major high-income economies are
expected to return to growth in 2014 and inflationary pressures are
forecasted to remain low in many markets,  the development of the global
economy nonetheless remains subject to a high degree of uncertainty. 
The strengthening of many mature markets marks a significant shift
from recent years when developing countries were the major drivers
of global GDP expansion.  Their recovery is also anticipated to boost
prospects for developing markets' export activity. 
High-income,  developed markets are expected to expand 22% in 2014with the euro area's GDP forecasted to return to modest growth.  The
USA is also expected to continue to reduce its bond buying programme
(quantitative easing),  which could lead to an increase in long-term
interest rates in some developed and developing countries.  Nonethelessthe strongest economic progress in the world will continue to be derived
from the emerging markets,  which are forecasted to increase 53% in
2014.  In many of these developing economies,  this growth is projected to
continue to support a rapid rise in wages and disposable income.  These
positive economic expectations and the outlook for consumer spendingparticularly in the emerging markets,  are forecasted to be supportive of
our growth aspirations in 2014.

In Western Europe,  with less severe austerity programmes in many
countries and low inflationary pressures supporting recovery and
modest GDP expansion,  GDP is projected to increase around 12%
in 2014.  In the euro area,  Germany,  the union's largest economy,  will
remain the main engine of growth,  fuelled by healthy export activity and
increasing domestic demand and consumer and investment spending. 
However,  the recovery will be fragile and continue to be constrained
by high unemployment rates and ongoing concerns regarding the
over-indebtedness of many of the region's governments and banks. 

European emerging markets are expected to continue to improve,  with
GDP estimated to grow at a healthy 28% in 2014.  Economic growth is
projected to come from increased exports as the region should benefit in
particular from a stronger euro area.  Increasing domestic consumption
is also expected to support economic activity.  In Russia,  the trend
of wage moderation and slowing income growth,  the gradual rise in
unemployment levels and further moderation in personal lending could
lead to a less robust consumption growth rate in 2014. 
In the USA,  according to the Federal Reserve,  GDP is forecasted to grow
30% in 2014,  driven by domestic consumption as well as increasing
industrial and export activities.  The consensus is that inflation will
remain moderate,  while the labour and housing markets will improvesupporting consumer spending and economic expansion.  The Federal
Reserve's strategy is anticipated to continue with its accommodative
policy stance,  reducing its quantitative easing programme as the year
progresses.  Headwinds are expected from further public spending cutsalthough at a lower rate than in 2013. 
In Asia,  GDP is projected to increase 42% in 2014.  With the exception
of Japan,  growth is expected to remain relatively high during the yearwith healthy industrial activity,  manageable inflationary pressures and
strong wage increases contributing to the region's economic expansion. 
Improving growth prospects in developed markets should also support
Asia's export activities.  China will remain the fastest-growing economy
and is forecasted to expand by 74%.  In Japan,  GDP is predicted to
increase 13% in 2014,  and is expected to continue to be driven by the
government's substantial stimulus programme.  However,  Japan's real
wage growth is forecasted to contract,  negatively impacting consumer
spending. 
In Latin America,  GDP is expected to increase 30% in 2014,  with low
unemployment rates and healthy domestic demand and consumer
spending supporting growth.  Nonetheless,  elevated inflation ratesparticularly in Argentina,  and a tight consumer debt environment are
forecasted to negatively impact growth.  Concerns also remain regarding
the expectations of more challenging global liquidity conditions and the
potential further weakening of several Latin American currencies.

In Europe,  improvements in consumer confidence and domestic
demand should positively impact the sporting goods industry in 2014. 
The region's industry will also gain momentum due to the large number
of European teams participating in the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil
and the importance of football for those markets.  This benefit will also
positively impact many European emerging markets,  including Russiawho also qualified.  Russia's sporting goods sector should also gain
additional momentum as the host nation for the 2014 Winter Olympic
Games.  Nonetheless,  trends of lower growth in disposable income rates
are expected to continue to negatively impact consumer sentiment and 
spending,  and lessen the sporting goods sector's expansion in some
European emerging markets,  especially in Russia. 
In the USA,  industry growth rates are expected to be ahead of the
economy's overall growth.  From a category perspective,  the trend
towards high-performance technical running and training footwear
looks set to continue.  Similarly,  advanced and highly innovative apparel
products are also predicted to be significant sporting goods sales drivers
for the year.  Lifestyle running is expected to recover and the US golf
market is also forecasted to see modest growth in 2014. 
In Greater China,  strong wage growth and domestic consumption is
predicted to propel sporting goods sales in 2014.  The trend and market
share shift towards international brands is expected to continue.  In other
Asian markets,  the sporting goods industry is also forecasted to grow in
2014,  albeit with regional differences.  Japan's sporting goods industry
is expected to grow modestly,  with the weaker yen and the substantial
government stimulus programmes helping to drive improvements in
consumer sentiment and domestic spending.  However,  an expected
sales tax increase in April may negatively impact the industry.  Most of
the other major Asian emerging markets are expected to see robust
sporting goods sales growth in 2014,  as domestic demand increases and
rising wages continue to drive purchases of discretionary items. 
The sporting goods industry in Latin America is projected to record
healthy growth in 2014,  with wage growth expected to promote
consumer spending and discretionary purchases.  Furthermore,  given
the significance of football in this region,  the industry is expected to
maintain momentum from sales relating to the 2014 FIFA World Cup
in Brazil.

In the absence of any major economic shocks,  we expect the global
sporting goods industry to grow in 2014.  In particular,  the industry
should benefit from major sporting events,  such as the world's largestthe FIFA World Cup,  hosted by Brazil,  as well as from the 2014 Winter
Olympic Games being held in Sochi,  Russia.  Many sporting goods
retailers will continue to move to a more omni-retail business modeland e-commerce and investment in digital are anticipated to remain
growth areas.  Following macroeconomic trends,  consumer spending
on sporting goods in the emerging economies is expected to grow
faster than in the more developed markets.  Private consumption in
many developed economies is forecasted to improve moderately in
2014,  supporting modest industry expansion in those markets.  While
inflationary pressures are projected to remain relatively contained in
most markets,  the recent currency devaluations in several emerging
market countries are likely to lead to significant price increases over
time in the affected countries.  In addition,  wage growth in the fastergrowing economies is forecasted to continue to add significant costs to
the industry,  especially where the industry sources and manufactures
sporting goods.

adidas Group currency-neutral sales to increase
at a high-single-digit rate in 2014

Retail sales to increase at a high-single- to low-doubledigit rate on a currency-neutral basis 
We expect adidas Group sales to increase at a high-single-digit rate on a
currency-neutral basis in 2014.  In particular,  this year's major sporting
events will provide positive stimulus to Group sales.  As the Official
Partner of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil,  the adidas brand will be the
most visible brand during the event and will benefit from record sales in
the football category.  Group sales development will also be favourably
impacted by our high exposure to fast-growing emerging markets as
well as the further expansion of Retail.  Currency translation is expected
to have a significant negative impact on our top-line development in
reported terms. 

adidas Group currency-neutral Retail segment sales are projected
to grow at a high-single- to low-double-digit rate in 2014.  The Group
expects a net increase of its store base of around 250 adidas and Reebok
stores in 2014.  We plan to open around 450 new stores,  depending on
the availability of desired locations.  New stores will primarily be located
in European Emerging Markets,  in particular Russia/CIS.  Approximately
200 stores will be closed over the course of the year.  Around 180 stores
will be remodelled.  Comparable store sales are expected to increase at
 low- to mid-single-digit rate compared to the prior year. 

Currency-neutral Wholesale revenues expected to
increase at a mid-single-digit rate 
20

13

154

We project currency-neutral Wholesale segment revenues to increase
at a mid-single-digit rate compared to the prior year.  Our growth
expectations are supported by our positive order backlog development
as well as positive retailer and trade show feedback.  Currencyneutral adidas Sport Performance sales are forecasted to increase
at a mid-single-digit rate,  driven by growth in key categories such as
football,  running and basketball.  adidas Originals & Sport Style revenues
are projected to increase at a mid-single-digit rate on a currency-neutral
basis,  driven by the further expansion of the adidas NEO label as well as
growth at adidas Originals.  Currency-neutral Reebok sales are expected
to increase at a mid-single-digit rate,  mainly due to growth in fitness
training and Classics as well as the further expansion of new categories
such as studio. 

Currency-neutral sales of Other Businesses to
grow at a low- to mid-single-digit rate
In 2014,  revenues of Other Businesses are expected to increase at a
low- to mid-single-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis.  TaylorMadeadidas Golf currency-neutral sales are projected to grow at a low- to
mid-single-digit rate compared to the prior year.  Product launches in
core categories such as metalwoods and irons as well as new product
introductions in footwear should support growth in this segment. 
Currency-neutral revenues at Rockport are forecasted to increase at a
mid- to high-single-digit rate,  driven by growth in core strategic product
concepts such as Total Motion and truWalkZero.  Currency-neutral sales
at Reebok-CCM Hockey are expected to grow at a mid-single-digit ratesupported by new product introductions in its key categories skates and
sticks. 

adidas Group sales expected to increase in
all geographical areas
We expect the Group's currency-neutral revenues to increase in all
of our geographical areas in 2014,  however at varying growth rates. 
In Western Europe,  the gradual improvement in the macroeconomic
environment as well as the 2014 FIFA World Cup will positively impact
sales development in this region.  In European Emerging Markets,  the
expansion of and improvements in our own-retail activities,  particularly
in Russia/CIS,  are forecasted to have a positive influence on Group sales. 
In North America,  we expect momentum to improve as we move through
2014,  with the adidas brand strengthening its product offering in major
categories such as running and basketball and Reebok gaining traction
with new product introductions in both footwear and apparel.  In Greater
China,  we expect growth to continue at similar levels to the prior year. 
This development will be primarily driven by expanding and solidifying
our distribution footprint.  In Other Asian Markets,  growth will be driven
by markets such as South Korea,  Southeast Asia and India.  Finally,  in
Latin America,  Group sales development is projected to be positively
impacted by the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

Group gross margin to improve in 2014

Operating margin to be between 85% and 90%

In 2014,  the adidas Group gross margin is forecasted to increase to
 level between 495% and 498% (2013: 493%).  Improvements are
expected in most segments.  Group gross margin will benefit from a
positive pricing,  product and regional sales mix,  as growth rates in
high-margin emerging markets are projected to be above growth rates
in more mature markets.  In addition,  the Reebok brand will positively
influence Group gross margin development.  However,  these positive
effects will be partly offset by less favourable hedging terms compared
to the prior year,  adverse currency movements in emerging markets as
well as increasing labour costs,  which are expected to negatively impact
our cost of sales. 

In 2014,  we expected the operating margin for the adidas Group to be
at a level between 85% and 90% (2013 excluding goodwill impairment
losses: 87%).  This development will be strongly influenced by currency
movements. 

Average operating working capital as a percentage
of sales to decrease moderately
In 2014,  average operating working capital as a percentage of sales is
expected to decrease moderately compared to the prior year level (2013:
209%).  This is mainly due to working capital improvements we expect to
achieve as we move through the year. 

We expect the number of employees within the adidas Group to increase
versus the prior year level.  Additional hires will be mainly related to
own-retail expansion.  The adidas Group will continue to spend around
1% of Group sales on research and development in 2014.  Areas of
particular focus include advanced cushioning solutions,  lightweight and
digital sports technologies as well as sustainable product innovation. 
Additionally,  investments and research emphasis will also include areas
such as new manufacturing processes and advanced materials  /

In 2014,  the Group's other operating expenses as a percentage of sales
are expected to be around the prior year level (2013: 423%).  Sales
and marketing working budget expenses as a percentage of sales are
projected to increase modestly compared to the prior year.  Marketing
investments will be centred on major sporting events such as the 2014
FIFA World Cup and highly innovative product launches,  particularly
in the running category.  Further,  we will support Reebok's growth
strategy in key fitness categories,  leveraging partnership assets such as
CrossFit,  Spartan Race and Les Mills.  Operating overhead expenditure
as a percentage of sales is forecasted to decrease modestly in 2014. 
Higher administrative and personnel expenses in the Retail segment
due to the planned expansion of the Group's store base will be offset by
leverage in other areas. 

Net income attributable to shareholders is expected to be at a level
between € 830 million and € 930 million compared to the 2013 net
income attributable to shareholders,  excluding goodwill impairment
losses,  of € 839 million.  This represents basic earnings per share of
between € 397 and € 445.  Interest rate expenses in 2014 are forecasted
to remain at the prior year level,  as lower interest expenses from
euro-denominated borrowings will be offset by higher interest expenses
from bank borrowings in emerging markets.  Net foreign exchange
losses in the financial result are also expected to be at a similar level
compared to the prior year.  The Group tax rate is expected to be at a level
of around 285% and thus more favourable compared to the 2013 tax rate
excluding goodwill impairment losses of 290%.

Capital expenditure to be between € 500 million
and € 550 million
In 2014,  capital expenditure is expected to amount to between
€ 500 million and € 550 million (2013: € 479 million).  Investments will
focus on adidas and Reebok controlled space initiatives,  in particular
in emerging markets.  These investments will account for around 50%
of total investments in 2014.  Other areas of investment include the
Group's logistics infrastructure,  the further development of the adidas
Group headquarters in Herzogenaurach,  Germany,  and the increased
deployment of SAP and other IT systems in major subsidiaries within
the Group.  Projected capital expenditure by segment is outlined in the
diagram  /  
DIAGRAM 02.  All investments within the adidas Group in 2014
are expected to be fully financed through cash generated from operating
activities. 

Excess cash to be used to support growth initiatives 
20

156

In 2014,  we expect continued positive cash flow from operating activities. 
Cash will be used to finance working capital needs,  investment activitiesas well as dividend payments.  We intend to largely use excess cash to
invest in our Route 2015 growth initiatives,  in particular the further
expansion of our own-retail activities.  In 2014,  gross borrowings of
€ 681 million will mature.  In order to ensure long-term flexibility,  we
aim to maintain a ratio of net borrowings over EBITDA of less than two
times as measured at year-end (2013: –02). 

Management to propose dividend of € 150
In light of the strong generation of cash flow from operating activities
in 2013,  Management will recommend paying a dividend of € 150 to
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) on May 8,  2014representing an increase of 11% compared to the prior year (2012:
€ 135).  Subject to shareholder approval,  the dividend will be paid on
May 9,  2014.  The proposal represents a payout ratio of 374% of net
income attributable to shareholders excluding goodwill impairment
losses,  compared to 357% in the prior year.  This complies with our
dividend policy,  according to which we intend to pay out between 20%
and 40% of net income attributable to shareholders annually.  Based on
the number of shares outstanding at the end of 2013,  the dividend payout
will thus increase 11% to € 314 million (2012: € 282 million). 

adidas Group expects further growth and
margin improvements in 2015
Based on the initiatives laid out in our Route 2015 strategic business
plan,  we project adidas Group sales and net income to increase in 2015. 
We also expect further improvements in operating margin.  Further
details of our Route 2015 strategic goals and initiatives are outlined in

Risk and Opportunity Report
The adidas Group continuously explores and develops opportunities to sustain earnings and drive
long-term increases in shareholder value.  We acknowledge that in our daily business we are exposed
to various risks and that it is necessary to take certain risks in order to be competitive and ensure
sustainable success.  Our risk and opportunity management principles and system provide the
framework for our Group to conduct business in a well-controlled environment. 

Risk and opportunity management principles 
01   /   adidas Group risk and opportunity management system 

The adidas Group is regularly confronted with risks and opportunities
which have the potential to negatively (risk) or positively (opportunity)
impact the assets,  liabilities,  financial position and profit and loss of the
Group,  or intangible assets such as brand image. 

Supervisory and Executive Boards 
We define risk as the potential occurrence of an external or internal
event (or series of events) that may negatively impact our ability to
achieve the Group's business objectives or financial goals.  Opportunity
is defined as the potential occurrence of an external or internal event (or
series of events) that can positively impact the Group's ability to achieve
its business objectives or financial goals.

Group Risk Management 
Risk Management Policy & Methodology/Support 
Monitoring &
Reporting 
In this Risk and Opportunity Report,  we have outlined the Group's most
important risks and opportunities as well as other risks that have a
particular relevance from an industry or financial market perspective.  We
have summarised risks in four main categories: Strategic,  OperationalLegal & Compliance and Financial.  Opportunities are classified in two
main categories: Strategic & Operational and Financial. 

Handling 
Risk Owners 
Identification 
Evaluation 
Risk and opportunity management system
The adidas AG Executive Board has the overall responsibility to operate
an effective risk and opportunity management system that ensures
comprehensive and consistent management of all significant risks and
opportunities.  The Group Risk Management department coordinates
the execution and further development of the adidas Group's risk and
opportunity management system and is the owner of the centrally
managed risk and opportunity management process on behalf of
the adidas AG Executive Board.  The adidas AG Supervisory Board
has the responsibility to monitor the effectiveness of the Group's risk
management system.  These duties are undertaken by the Supervisory
Board's Audit Committee.  In addition,  the Group Internal Audit
department also includes an assessment of compliance with the Group
Risk Management Policy as part of its regular auditing activities of
selected adidas Group subsidiaries or functions each year. 
To facilitate effective risk and opportunity management,  we implemented
an integrated risk and opportunity management system,  which is
based on the integrated frameworks for enterprise risk management
and internal controls developed and published by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 

Additionally,  it has been adapted to more appropriately reflect the
structure as well as company and management culture of the adidas
Group.  This system focuses on the identification,  evaluation,  handlingmonitoring and reporting of risks and opportunities.  The key objective of
the risk and opportunity management system is to protect and further
grow shareholder value through an opportunity-focused but risk-aware
decision-making framework. 
We believe that a key component of optimal risk and opportunity
management is the identification and evaluation of risks,  risk-mitigating
actions and opportunities where they arise.  In addition,  a concerted
approach to handling,  monitoring and reporting is of key importance. 
Therefore,  risk and opportunity management is a Group-wide activitywhich utilises critical day-to-day management insight from both global
and local business units and functions.

The Risk Owners use various instruments in the risk and opportunity
identification process,  such as primary qualitative and quantitative
research including trend scouting,  consumer surveys as well as
feedback from our business partners and controlled space network. 
These efforts are supported by global market research and competitor
analysis.  Through this process,  we seek to identify the marketscategories,  consumer target groups and product styles which show
most potential for future growth at a local and global level.  Equally,  our
analysis focuses on those areas that are at risk of saturation,  or exposed
to increased competition or changing consumer tastes.  However,  our
risk and opportunity identification process is not only limited to external
risk factors or opportunities,  it also includes an internal perspective
considering processes,  projects,  human resources or compliance
aspects. 

/  Risk and opportunity evaluation: In order to manage risks and
opportunities in an effective way,  we evaluate identified risks and
opportunities individually according to a systematic evaluation
methodology,  which is applied consistently and allows adequate
prioritisation as well as allocation of resources.  Risk and opportunity
evaluation is also part of the Risk Owners' responsibility.  The Group Risk 
When assessing risks,  we consider two perspectives the gross risk
and the net risk.  While the gross risk reflects the worst-case negative
(financial) impact before any mitigating actions,  the net risk reflects the
expected remaining (financial) impact after all mitigating actions.  On the
one hand,  this approach allows for a good understanding of the impact
of mitigating action taken,  and on the other hand it provides the basis for
scenario analysis.  Our assessment of risks presented in this report only
reflects the net risk perspective.  We measure the actual financial impact
of high-level risks that materialised against the original assessment
on a yearly basis.  In this way,  we ensure continuous monitoring of the
accuracy of risk evaluations across the Group,  which enables us to
continuously improve evaluation methodology based on our findings. 
In assessing the potential effect from opportunities,  each opportunity
is appraised with respect to viability,  commerciality and potential
risks.  This approach is applied to longer-term strategic prospects but
also to shorter-term tactical and opportunistic initiatives at both the
Group and,  more extensively,  the market and brand level.  In contrast
to the risk evaluation,  only the net perspective exists for assessing
opportunities.

/  Risk and opportunity identification: The adidas Group continuously
monitors the macroeconomic environment,  developments in the
sporting goods industry,  as well as internal processes,  to identify risks
and opportunities as early as possible.  The Risk Owners (i, e.  all direct
reports to the adidas AG Executive Board and the Managing Directors of
all our markets) have primary responsibility for the identification of risks
and opportunities.  The Group Risk Management department has defined
 catalogue of potential risk areas (Risk Universe) to assist Risk Owners
in identifying and categorising risks and opportunities.  Our Group-wide
network of Risk Owners ensures an effective identification of risks and
opportunities.  While various Risk Owners according to their area of
responsibility actively monitor the overall macroeconomic,  politicalsocial,  regulatory and competitive landscape,  others closely observe
brand,  distribution channel and price point developments as well as
changes in other areas such as input prices,  financial market conditions
or technological developments. 

Management department supports and guides the Risk Owners in the
evaluation process.  According to our risk and opportunity management
methodology,  risks and opportunities are evaluated by looking at two
dimensions the potential (financial) impact and the likelihood that
this impact materialises,  both considering the upcoming twelve-month
period.  This does not mean that the respective Risk Owners are only
looking at risks from a short-term perspective.  Their assessment also
includes a mid-term (12 to 24 months) and long-term (beyond 24 months)
perspective.  The potential impact is evaluated by utilising five categories:
marginal,  minor,  moderate,  significant and major.  These categories
represent quantitative or equivalent qualitative measurements.  The
quantitative measurements are based on the potential financial effect on
the relevant income statement metrics (operating profit,  financial result
or tax expenses).  Qualitative measurements used are,  for example,  the
degree of media exposure or additional senior management attention
needed.  Likelihood represents the possibility that a given risk or
opportunity may materialise with the specific impact.  The likelihood of
individual risks and opportunities is evaluated on a percentage scale
divided into five categories: unlikely,  possible,  likely,  probable and highly
probable  /

Our risk and opportunity management process contains the following

Risk and Opportunity Report 
/ 035 
/

/  Risk and opportunity handling: Risks and opportunities are treated
in accordance with the Group's risk and opportunity management
principles as described in the Group Risk Management Policy.  Risk
Owners are in charge of developing and implementing appropriate
risk-mitigating actions and exploiting opportunities within their area
of responsibility.  In addition,  the Risk Owners need to determine a
general risk handling strategy for the identified risks,  which is either
risk avoidance,  risk reduction with the objective to minimise (financial)
impact and/or likelihood of occurrence,  risk transfer to a third party or
risk acceptance.  The decision on the implementation of the respective
risk handling strategy also takes into account the costs in relation to the
effectiveness of any planned mitigating actions if applicable.  The Group
Risk Management department works closely with the Risk Owners to
monitor the continuous progress of planned mitigating actions and
assess the viability of already implemented mitigating actions. 
/  Risk and opportunity monitoring and reporting: Our integrated risk
and opportunity management system aims to increase the transparency
of Group risks and opportunities.  As both risks and opportunities are
subject to constant change,  Risk Owners not only monitor developmentsbut also the adequacy and effectiveness of the current risk handling
strategy on an ongoing basis.

Regular risk reporting consists of a two-step reporting stream
supported and facilitated by a globally used Group-wide IT solution that
was implemented in 2011.  Firstly,  on a quarterly basis,  Risk Owners are
required to report to Group Risk Management risks with a possible gross
impact rating of at least moderate (financial equivalent: impact on the
relevant income statement metric above the threshold of € 10 million)
and a net impact rating of at least minor (financial equivalent: impact on
the relevant income statement metric above the threshold of € 1 million)both regardless of the likelihood of materialising.  Opportunities are
aggregated separately,  with Risk Owners reporting all opportunities
with an impact rating of at least minor (financial equivalent: above
€ 1 million impact on the relevant income statement metric).  SecondlyGroup Risk Management aggregates the reported risks and,  also
on a quarterly basis,  provides the adidas AG Executive Board with a
consolidated Group-wide report based on the Risk Owners' input,  which
highlights substantial individual risks and opportunities as well as,  on an
aggregated level,  key areas of risk and opportunity. 
Material changes in previously reported risks and/or newly identified
risks with a potential net impact of moderate (financial equivalent:
impact on the relevant income statement metric above the threshold of
€ 10 million),  and any issues identified which due to their material nature
require immediate reporting to the Executive Board,  are also reported
outside the regular quarterly reporting stream on an ad hoc basis. 

Compliance management system (adidas Group Fair
Play Compliance Framework)
At the adidas Group,  we consider compliance with the law as well as
external and internal regulations as imperative.  Every employee is
required to act ethically and compliant with the law as well as external
and internal regulations while executing the Group's business.  Violations
must be avoided under all circumstances.  As a company with worldwide
operations and more than 50000 employees,  however,  the Group
accepts that it will never be possible to exclude compliance violations
with absolute certainty. 
Both the adidas Group Fair Play Compliance Framework and our risk
and opportunity management system are closely aligned and both are
overseen by the Group's Chief Compliance Officer who reports directly
to the Group's Chief Executive Officer.  Together,  these systems create
the organisational requirements for Group-wide awareness of the
respective governing law,  of our internal rules and guidelines as well as
for ensuring their observance.  We see compliance as all-encompassingspanning all business functions throughout the entire value chain,  from
supply chain through to the end consumer.  As a result,  the identificationanalysis and evaluation of potential compliance risks are essential
for our risk and opportunity management process.  The Group Risk
Management department works closely with the Risk Owners and
responsible Compliance Officers to conduct a systematic assessment
of key compliance risks on a quarterly basis  /   LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE
SEE
RISKS,  P.  170. 
The Group's compliance management system is based on the OECD
Principles of Corporate Governance.  It refers to the OECD Guidelines for
Multinational Enterprises and is designed to:

/ 
support the achievement of qualitative and sustainable growth
through good corporate governance practice;
/ 
reduce and mitigate the risk of financial losses or damage caused by
non-compliant conduct;
/ 
protect and further enhance the value and reputation of the Group
and its brands through compliant conduct;
/ 
preserve diversity by fighting harassment and discrimination;
/ 
contribute to continuous improvement in all aspects of the Group's
business. 
In order to ensure standardised and exemplary actions and behaviourwe introduced our Code of Conduct in 2006,  which is applicable in all
regions and business areas.  It stipulates guidelines for behaviour in
everyday work and is available both on our website and on our intranet. 
The Code of Conduct is the cornerstone of our compliance management
programme which is founded on three pillars: prevention,  detection and
response.

Appropriate and timely response to compliance violations is essential. 
Therefore,  we have established a global network of local Compliance
Officers reporting directly to the Chief Compliance Officer of the Group
as dedicated contact persons,  to whom complaints and information
concerning compliance violations can be reported.  We track,  monitor
and report potential incidents of non-compliance worldwide using a
web-based reporting solution which can be accessed by all Compliance
Officers across the Group.  Appropriate sanction mechanisms (including
termination of employment) are used to react promptly to possible
compliance violations.  Insights gained from the investigation of past
violations are used to continuously improve the compliance management
system. 
The Chief Compliance Officer regularly reports to the Executive Board
on the further development of the compliance programme and on major
compliance cases,  which are also reported to the Audit Committee. 
Further,  he reports to the Audit Committee at one of its meetings at least
once a year concerning the contents and the further development of the
compliance programme. 

The internal control and risk management system relating to the
consolidated financial reporting process of the adidas Group represents a
process embedded within the Group-wide corporate governance system. 
It aims at providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the
Group's external financial reporting by ensuring Group-wide compliance
with statutory provisions,  in particular the International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) and internal consolidated financial reporting
policies (Group Finance Manual).  We regard the internal control and risk
management system as a process based on the principle of segregation
of duties,  encompassing various sub-processes in the areas of
Accounting,  Controlling,  Taxes,  Treasury,  Planning,  Reporting and Legalfocusing on the identification,  assessment,  treatment,  monitoring and
reporting of financial reporting risks.  Clearly defined responsibilities are
assigned to each distinct sub-process in the various areas.  In a first stepthe internal control and risk management system serves to identify and
assess as well as to limit and control risks identified in the consolidated
financial reporting process which might result in our consolidated
financial statements not being in conformity with internal and external
regulations. 

161

To ensure timely detection of potential infringements of statutory
regulations or internal guidelines,  we have implemented whistleblowing
procedures which allow employees to either report concerns over
wrongdoing/potential compliance violations internally (e.g.  directly to
their supervisor,  to the Chief Compliance Officer or other Compliance
Officers,  the relevant HR manager or the Works Council) or externally
via an independent,  confidential reporting hotline and email service. 
The hotline (Fair Play hotline) is available around the clock,  seven days
 week and can be called free of charge in over 60 countries worldwide. 
In addition,  our Group Internal Audit and Profit Protection departments
conduct regular audits and investigations to detect potential incidents of
non-compliance.  In case of reported or suspected compliance violationsad hoc investigations may be undertaken as well. 

Description of the main features of the internal
control and risk management system relating to the
consolidated financial reporting process pursuant
to § 315 section 2 no.  5 German Commercial Code
(Handelsgesetzbuch HGB)

Internal Controls over Financial Reporting (ICoFR) serve to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of reporting and
compliance with applicable laws and regulations despite identified
financial reporting risks.  To monitor the effectiveness of ICoFR,  the
Group Internal Audit department and the Group Policies & Internal
Controls department regularly review accounting-relevant processes. 
Additionally,  as part of the year-end audit,  the external auditor selects
and examines internal controls,  including the IT systems,  to assess their
effectiveness.  The Audit Committee of the adidas AG Supervisory Board
also monitors the effectiveness of ICoFR.  However,  due to limitations of
ICoFR,  even with appropriate and functional systems absolute certainty
about the effectiveness of ICoFR cannot be guaranteed. 
The Group Finance Manual comprises uniform consolidated financial
reporting policies which are mandatory for all Group companies and
available to all employees involved in the financial reporting process
through the Group-wide intranet.  We update the Group Finance Manual
on a regular basis,  dependent on regulatory changes and internal
developments.  Changes to the Group Finance Manual are promptly
communicated to all Group companies.  Clear policies serve to limit
employees' scope of discretion with regard to recognition and valuation
of assets and liabilities,  thus reducing the risk of inconsistent accounting
practices within the Group.  We aim to ensure compliance with the
Group Finance Manual through continuous adherence to the four-eyes
principle in accounting-related processes.  In addition,  the local manager
responsible for the accounting process within the Group companies
and the respective local Managing Director confirm adherence to the
Group Finance Manual and International Financial Reporting Standards
in a written declaration of completeness,  which is provided to Group
Accounting on a quarterly basis.

Prevention includes,  for example,  policies,  guidelines and procedureswhich provide all employees with clear and precise behaviour instructions
and are updated on a continuous basis.  These policies,  guidelines and
procedures are available for all employees on the Group's intranet in
our Global Policy Manual.  Another vital part of prevention is trainingsuch as the web-based Code of Conduct training,  which is mandatory
for all employees worldwide.  The Group also has a Group Privacy Policywhich is available in multiple languages (e.g.  German,  English,  SpanishPortuguese,  Chinese and Russian).  Furthermore,  we have launched an
anti-trust training programme incorporating web-based training and
face-to-face training workshops.  It is mandatory for all employees who
are exposed to customers and competitors and it forms an integral part
of the Group's skills and operational training programme within Global
Sales.  The Group's Legal & Compliance department monitors,  updates
and improves the training programme on a continuous basis.  Before
our products enter the market,  our Intellectual Property department
examines the technologies,  trademarks,  logos and designs to identify
possible infringements of the rights of third parties as well as product
safety.

The accounting for Group companies is conducted either locally or by
an adidas Group Shared Service Centre.  Most of the IT ERP systems
used are based on a Group-wide standardised SAP system.  Some Group
companies use Navision-based ERP software.  As part of an initiative
aimed at harmonising our system infrastructure (One ERP),  we will also
introduce an SAP-based ERP system within these Group companies
in the medium term.  Following approval by the Finance Director of
the respective Group company,  the local financial statements are
transferred into a central consolidation system based on SAP SEM-BCS. 
At Group level,  the regularity and reliability of the financial statements
prepared by Group companies are reviewed by Group Accounting and
Controlling.  These measures include automated validation in the system
as well as creation of reports and analyses to ensure data integrity and
adherence to reporting logic.  In addition,  differences between current
year and prior year financial data as well as budget figures are analysed
on a distribution channel and market level.  If necessary,  the Group seeks
the opinion of independent experts to review business transactions
that occur infrequently and not on a routine basis.  After ensuring data
plausibility,  the centrally coordinated and monitored consolidation
process begins,  running automatically on SAP SEM-BCS.  Controls
within the individual consolidation steps,  such as those relating to the
consolidation of debt or of income and expenses,  are conducted both
manually and system-based,  using automatically created consolidation
logs.  Any inadequacies are remedied manually by systematically
processing the individual errors and differences and are reported back
to the Group companies.  After finalisation of all consolidation steps,  all
items in the consolidated income statement and in the consolidated
statement of financial position are analysed with respect to trends and
variances.  Unless already otherwise clarified,  the Group companies are
asked to explain any identified material deviations. 
All financial systems used are protected against malpractice by means
of appropriate authorisation concepts,  approval concepts and access
restrictions.  Access authorisations are reviewed on a regular basis
and updated if required.  The risk of data loss or outage of accountingrelated IT systems is minimised by Group IT through central control
and monitoring of virtually all IT systems,  centralised management of
change processes and regular data backups. 

Focus on advancements in compliance management
system in 2013
In 2013,  we further enhanced the Group's governance structures
and processes with a particular emphasis on the Group's compliance
management system.  We launched the adidas Group Fair Play Compliance
Framework,  which is applicable to the whole Group regardless of
brand,  market,  distribution channel or function.  This included the
implementation of the global Fair Play hotline and email service,  the
creation and introduction of a global reporting solution for potential
incidents of non-compliance as well as a worldwide communication
and education initiative via brochures and posters at all adidas Group
locations,  including offices,  own-retail stores and distribution/logistics
centres.  We also further activated the global network of Compliance
Officers,  providing training on a global,  regional and local level.  Regarding
risk and opportunity management,  the Group Risk Management
department held numerous training sessions and workshops with Risk
Owners as well as functional and market management teams worldwide
(e.g.  Greater China,  Russia/CIS) to further strengthen the understanding
of the Group's risk and opportunity management system,  in order to
increase risk awareness and to establish a culture of risk-conscious
decision-making.  In addition,  we updated and adjusted our Risk
Universe and our Group Risk Management Policy,  which is available to
all Group employees on our intranet.  The policy outlines the principlesprocesses,  tools,  risk areas,  key responsibilities,  reporting requirements
and communication timelines within our Group.  Furthermore,  Group
Policies & Internal Controls held the Group's first-ever global Internal
Controls Conference,  bringing together employees from various areas
of internal governance including Internal Controls,  Internal Audit,  Profit
Protection,  Risk Management and Compliance.  This event drove further
alignment worldwide and kicked off various initiatives across the Group
to further optimise and harmonise risk management,  control and
compliance activities.

Growth in the sporting goods industry is highly dependent on consumer
spending and consumer confidence.  Economic downturns and sociopolitical factors such as civil unrest,  nationalisation or expropriation,  in
particular in regions where the Group is highly represented,  therefore
pose a significant risk to sales development.  In addition,  significant
changes in the regulatory environment (e.g.  trade restrictions,  tax
legislation,  product quality and safety standards,  etc. ) could lead
to potential sales shortfalls or cost increases.  To mitigate these
macroeconomic,  socio-political and regulatory risks,  the Group strives to
balance sales across key global regions and also between developed and
emerging markets.  We also continuously monitor the macroeconomicpolitical and regulatory landscape in all our key markets to anticipate
potential problem areas,  so that we are able to quickly adjust our
business activities accordingly upon any change in conditions.  Potential
adjustments may be more conservative product purchasing,  tight
working capital management and an increased focus on cost control. 
Furthermore,  a core element of our positioning in performance sports
is the utilisation of an extensive global event and partnership portfolio
where demand is more predictable and less sensitive to macroeconomic
influences.  In addition,  by building on our leading position within the
sporting goods industry,  we actively engage in supporting policymakers
and regulators to liberalise global trade,  curtail trade barriers and
proactively adapt to significant changes in the regulatory environment.

and regulatory uncertainty in certain countries in Latin America,  the
Middle East and Southeast Asia,  we still regard the potential impact of
macroeconomic,  socio-political and regulatory factors as major.  Given
our broad-based risk mitigation,  we now assess the likelihood that
adverse macroeconomic,  socio-political or regulatory events could
impact our business to that extent as possible (2012: likely).

Risks related to distribution strategy
The inability to appropriately influence in which channels the Group's
products are sold constitutes a continuous risk.  Grey market activityparallel imports or the distribution of our products on open online
marketplaces could negatively affect our own sales performance and
the image of our Group's brands.  In a few individual markets,  we work
with distributors or strategic partners whose approach might differ from
our own distribution practices and standards.  This could also negatively
impact the adidas Group's business performance.  Furthermore,  weakly
defined segmentation and channel strategies could lead to an unhealthy
utilisation of our multiple distribution channels as well as strong
retaliation from our customers.  As a result,  the Group has developed
and implemented clearly defined distribution policies and procedures to
avoid over-distribution of products in a particular channel and limit the
exposure to unwanted channels such as grey markets or open online
marketplaces.  In addition,  we conduct specific trainings for our sales
force to appropriately manage product distribution and ensure that the
right product is sold at the right point of sale to the right consumer at an
adequate price  /   GLOBAL SALES STRATEGY,  P.  72. 
SEE

Risks related to media and stakeholder activities
The adidas Group faces considerable risk if we are unable to uphold
high levels of consumer awareness,  affiliation and purchase intent
for our brands.  Adverse media coverage on our products or business
practices,  unfavourable stakeholder initiatives as well as negative social
media discussion may significantly hurt the Group's reputation and
brand image and eventually lead to a sales slowdown.  To mitigate these
risks,  we pursue proactive,  open communication with key stakeholders
(e.g.  consumers,  media,  non-governmental organisations,  the financial
community,  etc. ) on a continuous basis.  We have also defined clear
mission statements,  values and goals for all our brands  /   GLOBAL
SEE
BRANDS STRATEGY,  P.  77  /  
SEE OTHER BUSINESSES STRATEGY,  P.  86.  These
form the foundation of our product and brand communication strategies. 
Furthermore,  we continue to invest significant marketing resources to
build brand equity and foster consumer awareness. 

20

13

164

Nevertheless,  we still believe that unbalanced product distribution and
the inability to effectively manage our different sales channels could
have a significant impact on the Group.  As a result of the dynamic market
environment and the fast-changing world of online sales,  we continue to
evaluate the likelihood of materialising as possible. 

Despite our global diversification,  which reduces reliance on a particular
market as far as possible,  we still remain vulnerable to negative
developments in key sales markets such as Russia/CIS,  China or North
America as well as our important sourcing countries.  Therefore,  we
continue to regard the potential impact of these risks as significant. 
Due to our strong relationships with suppliers and customers as well as
our positive expectations for our key sales markets we now assess the
likelihood of materialising as unlikely (2012: possible). 

Dependency risks
Risks arise from a dependence on particular suppliers,  customersother business partners,  products or even markets.  An over-reliance
on a supplier for a substantial portion of the Group's product volumeor an over-dependence on a particular customer,  increases the Group's
vulnerability to delivery and sales shortfalls and could lead to significant
margin pressure.  Similarly,  a strong dependence on certain products or
markets could make the Group very susceptible to swings in consumer
demand or changes in the market environment. 
To mitigate these risks,  the Group works with a broad network of
suppliers and for the vast majority of its products does not have a singlesourcing model.  Likewise,  we utilise a broad distribution strategy which
includes further expanding our controlled space activities.  This enables
us to reduce negative consequences resulting from sales shortfalls
that can occur with key customers.  Specifically,  no single customer
of our Group accounted for more than 10% of Group sales in 2013. 
Furthermore,  we consistently provide a well-balanced product portfolio
with no particular model or article contributing more than 1% to Group
sales,  which enables us to minimise negative effects from sudden
unexpected changes in consumer demand. 

Nevertheless,  we continue to believe that unsubstantiated negative
media coverage,  uncontrolled social media activities and stakeholder
activism could have a significant impact on our Group.  Despite the
fast-moving and hardly controllable nature of social media as well as
ever-increasing media and other stakeholder activities worldwide,  we
still regard the likelihood of being affected to such an extent as likely. 

Customer consolidation and cross-border expansion/
private label risks
The adidas Group is exposed to risks from consolidation amongst
retailers as well as the increase of retailers' own private label
businesses.  In addition,  several key accounts,  particularly in Europecontinue to expand internationally while centralising their purchasing
activities.  As a result,  we may experience a reduction of our bargaining
power,  reduced shelf space allocation from retailers and lower sales and
margin due to price arbitrage.

Group Management Report Financial Review
Risk and Opportunity Report   /  Strategic Risks 
/ 035 
/

To mitigate these risks,  we maintain a regionally balanced sales mixfocusing on cementing strong relationships with retailers and adapting
the Group's distribution strategy with a particular focus on controlled
space initiatives /  
SEE GLOBAL SALES STRATEGY,  P.  72.  In addition,  we
are constantly investing in strengthening brand equity to increase the
attractiveness and consumer appeal of our products  /   GLOBAL BRANDS
SEE
STRATEGY,  P.  77.  We also decided to create a new market structure in
Western Europe with one aligned strategy going forward to be more
attractive for consumers and customers.  As a result,  we now assess
the potential impact of customer consolidation,  cross-border expansion
of key accounts and growth of private label offerings as moderate
(2012: significant).  However,  we regard the likelihood of these risks
materialising as possible. 

In order to adequately manage these risks,  we maintain a Global
Policy Manual that illustrates all relevant Group policies and is freely
accessible to all employees via the Group's intranet.  In addition,  we
document key business processes to create transparency and enable
the implementation of proper control mechanisms.  By operating a
Group-wide risk management system,  compliance management
system and internal control network,  we further mitigate these risks. 
Nonetheless,  we continue to believe the potential impact of these risks
could be major.  Because of the improvements we made in the last twelve
months,  particularly with respect to compliance management and
internal controls as discussed earlier in this report,  we now consider the
likelihood of being affected to such a degree as unlikely (2012: possible). 

Consumer demand risks 
To mitigate competition risks,  we continuously monitor and analyse
competitive and market information in order to be able to anticipate
unfavourable changes in the competitive environment rather than
reacting to such changes.  This enables us to proactively adjust our
marketing activities when needed.  We also pursue a strategy of entering
into long-term agreements with key promotion partners such as FIFAFC Bayern Munich or Derrick Rose,  as well as adding new partners
to refresh and diversify our portfolio,  e.g.  Juventus FC,  Mesut Özil or
Jeremy Lin.  In addition,  our product and communication initiatives are
designed to drive market share growth and to strengthen our brands'
market position.  As a result,  we now assess the potential impact of
competition risks as significant (2012: major) although we expect
competition in our industry to remain intense.  However,  we regard the
likelihood of an impact of such magnitude as possible. 

Risks related to risk and control environment
Failure to identify and actively manage substantial risks and to
implement and maintain adequate internal controls across the Group
could result in improper decisions,  higher costs,  compliance violation
and fraud and also cause reputational damage.  Furthermore,  a lack of
documentation of processes and procedures could result in a lack of
risk awareness among the Group's employees and facilitates fraud and
compliance violations. 

Failure to anticipate and respond to changes in consumer demand
for sporting goods products is one of the most serious threats to our
industry.  Consumer demand changes can be sudden and unexpectedparticularly in our fashion-related businesses.  Because industry product
procurement cycles average 12 to 18 months,  the Group faces a risk of
short-term revenue loss in cases where it is unable to respond quickly
to such changes.  Even more critical,  however,  is the risk of continuously
overlooking a new consumer trend or failing to acknowledge its potential
magnitude over a sustained period of time. 

165
13

Strategic alliances amongst competitors and/or retailers and
intense competition for consumers and promotion partnerships from
well-established industry peers and new market entrants (e.g.  new
brands,  vertical retailers) pose a substantial risk to the adidas Group. 
This could lead to harmful competitive behaviour,  such as price wars in
the marketplace or bidding wars for promotion partnerships.  Sustained
pricing pressure in one of the Group's key markets could threaten the
Group's sales and profitability development.  Aggressive competitive
practices could also drive increases in marketing costs and market
share losses,  thus hurting the Group's profitability and market position. 

To mitigate these risks,  identifying and responding to shifts in consumer
demand as early as possible is a key responsibility of our brands and,  in
particular,  of the respective Risk Owners.  Therefore,  we utilise extensive
primary and secondary research tools as outlined in our risk and
opportunity identification process. 
As a leader in our industry,  we are focused on influencing rather than
reacting to the changing consumer environment.  We invest significant
resources in research and development to innovate and bring fresh new
technologies and designs to market /   RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENTSEE

As we further increased our supply chain flexibility and further aligned
our planning cycles in 2013,  we now believe the potential impact of
missing an important trend or failing to adequately tackle shifts in
consumer demand could be moderate (2012: significant).  Given the
broad spectrum of our Group's product offering,  feedback from retailersconsumers and athletes as well as evidence from our own-retail stores
and other early indicators /  
SEE INTERNAL GROUP MANAGEMENT SYSTEMP.  118,  we consider the likelihood of these risks materialising to such an

Operational Risks
Own-retail risks
New adidas,  Reebok and Rockport own-retail stores require considerable
up-front investment in furniture and fixtures as well as ongoing
maintenance.  In addition,  own-retail activities often require longer-term
lease or rent commitments.  Retail also employs significantly more
personnel in relation to sales than our wholesale business.  The higher
portion of fixed costs compared to our wholesale business may cause a
larger profitability impact in cases of significant sales declines.  Success
in own retail is predominantly related to the skills and performance of
our employees.  High turnover of staff as well as a lack of the required
skills and qualifications of own-retail employees could negatively
affect sales and profitability.  Ineffective or inconsistent leadership and
an inadequate culture with respect to operating own-retail stores with
commercial expertise may also contribute to suboptimal business
performance.  In addition,  delayed openings or poorly executed store
operations could lead to sales shortfalls and also negatively affect brand
image.  Furthermore,  inability to secure appropriate store locations may
result in a worse than expected sales development. 

20

13

166

The Group reduces these risks by applying various measures.  We run
multiple training initiatives for own-retail employees at all levels,  from
store clerk to top management.  At the same time,  we constantly monitor
staff turnover and actively manage succession and career development
to reduce attrition.  Furthermore,  we almost only enter into new lease
contracts with durations of no more than ten years.  Store openings are
managed according to a standardised Group-wide business plan model. 
Store performance is measured by a retail scorecard consisting of nine
quantitative key performance indicators.  Underperforming stores are
reorganised,  remodelled or closed,  as appropriate. 
Further improving our sophistication as a retailer by investing in
management expertise,  employee development as well as in IT systems
remains a key priority for 2014 /  
SEE GLOBAL SALES STRATEGY,  P.  72. 
Nevertheless,  we maintain our assessment of a potential major impact
on the Group's performance and a likelihood of materialising of possible
from risks related to own retail. 

To mitigate these risks,  we continuously monitor the global
transportation market in order to be able to quickly adapt to changes
in the transportation environment and secure required capacity.  We
work closely with multiple logistics service providers to guarantee
transportation of our products to the desired destinations.  In additionwe buy insurance coverage against theft or physical damage during
transportation and storage.  Furthermore,  in case of malfunctioning
logistics systems or warehouse processes,  we actively re-prioritise the
allocation of products to minimise damage caused. 
Given the importance of logistics processes to ensure the proper flow of
goods and based on our experience in the last two years,  we now rate the
potential impact of logistics risks as major (2012: significant).  Howeveras a result of our learnings from substantial logistics malfunctioning in
Russia in 2013,  we assess the likelihood of being affected to such an
extent as possible (2012: likely). 

Marketing risks
Flawless execution of marketing activities is critical to the success of
the Group and its brands.  Therefore,  unaligned product creation,  range
development,  go-to-market or brand communication processes could
lead to additional costs,  suboptimal sales performance and the inability
to resonate with the consumer as desired.  Poorly executed marketing
activities may also result in negative media coverage and hurt brand
image.  Similarly,  inadequate or insufficient investment in brand-building
could negatively affect our ability to maintain brand momentum and our
competitive edge in the marketplace. 
In order to reduce such risks,  our global and local marketing departments
are constantly cooperating and thereby ensuring consistent execution of
key initiatives.  Through continuous planning and alignment within the
marketing organisation and also cross-functionally,  we enable both
consumer relevance and operational excellence.  Despite our brands'
marketing strength and track record,  we still believe these risks could
have a significant potential impact for the Group,  and we continue to
assess the likelihood of materialising as likely.

As a global company with business operations in numerous countries,  the
Group requires well-functioning logistics processes,  from the supplier to
our own warehouses and from our distribution centres to the customer. 
Any interruption of these processes could negatively affect our ability to
fulfil orders and deliver products,  leading to sales shortfalls,  additional
costs and deterioration of customer relationships.  Inability to secure
transportation or warehousing capacity,  errors by employees as well as
malfunctions in IT logistics systems could all disrupt the flow of goods. 

Building strong relationships with retailers to be a valuable and
reliable business partner for them is one of the guiding principles of
our Wholesale segment /   GLOBAL SALES STRATEGY,  P.  72.  Failure to
SEE
cement and maintain strong relationships with retailers could have
substantial negative effects on our wholesale activities and thus the
Group's business performance.  Losing important customers in key
markets due to subpar relationship management would result in
significant sales shortfalls.

To achieve our sales and profitability targets,  it is paramount to
successfully convert orders into sales,  drive sell-through at the point of
sale and have product prices that are competitive in the marketplace. 
Failure to do so would result in sales and profit shortfalls.  In additionprice increases required to compensate for higher product costs might
not be realised in the marketplace,  leading to margin declines. 
To mitigate these risks,  we pursue a range of pricing strategies. 
We closely monitor order book conversion as well as sell-out and
sell-through performance and adjust prices where required.  In additionour continuous investment in brand-building and marketing helps us
drive our business at various price points and supports a premium
positioning.  Furthermore,  we work closely with our retail customers to
minimise mark-downs and potentially re-allocate product. 
As a result of these mitigating actions,  the experience we gained in
particular in the last twelve months related to pricing decisions as well
as our brand strength,  broad product offering and pricing architecturewe now assess the potential impact of sales and pricing as moderate
(2012: major).  However,  due to a difficult macroeconomic environment
and intense competition,  particularly in Europe,  we regard the likelihood
of being affected to such an extent as probable (2012: possible). 

Supplier risks
Almost the entire adidas Group product offering is sourced through
independent suppliers,  mainly located in Asia  /   GLOBAL OPERATIONSSEE
P.  94.  To reduce the risk of business interruptions following the
potential underperformance of a supplier or a potential supplier defaultwe work with vendors who demonstrate reliability,  quality,  innovation
and continuous improvement. 

Inventory risks
As we place initial production orders around six months in advance
of delivery,  the adidas Group is exposed to inventory risks relating to
misjudging consumer demand at the time of production planning.  A
sudden decline in demand has the potential to cause excess inventories. 
This can have negative implications for our financial performanceincluding higher levels of clearance activity and inventory obsolescence
as well as reduced liquidity due to higher operating working capital
requirements. 
Similarly,  a sudden increase in demand can lead to product shortfalls
at the point of sale.  In this situation,  our Group faces the risk of missed
sales opportunities and/or customer and consumer disappointmentwhich could lead to a reduction in brand loyalty and hurt our reputation
as an on-time,  in-full supplier.  In addition,  the Group faces potential
profitability impacts from additional costs such as airfreight in efforts to
speed up replenishment. 
In order to mitigate these risks,  we continuously strive to improve our
forecasting and material planning processes.  To that end,  in 2013,  we
further improved our forecasting approach by more closely aligning
processes and timelines of major business functions /   INTERNAL
SEE
GROUP MANAGEMENT SYSTEM,  P.  118.  In addition,  our Global Operations
function offers sophisticated and tailored replenishment models in order
to shorten order-to-delivery times,  ensuring availability of products
while avoiding excess inventories  /   GLOBAL OPERATIONS,  P.  94. 
SEE
The expected over-proportionate growth of the Retail segment will
increase the exposure towards swings in consumer demand,  and also
makes the Group more susceptible to the risk of inventory shrinkage
or excess inventory.  However,  as a result of continuous progress in our
improvement efforts regarding planning processes and supply chain
flexibility,  we now assess the potential impact related to inventory
clearance to be moderate (2012: significant),  albeit with a likelihood of
materialising of likely (2012: possible).

Sales and pricing risks 
Furthermore,  in order to minimise any potential negative consequences
such as product quality shortfalls,  increased product lead times or
violation of our Workplace Standards,  we enforce strict control and
inspection procedures at our suppliers and also demand adherence to
social and environmental standards throughout our supply chain  /  
SEE
SUSTAINABILITY,  P.  111.  In addition,  we have selectively bought insurance
coverage for the risk of business interruptions caused by physical
damage to supplier premises.  Despite our commitment to enhance our
mitigating actions and to minimise the potential impact of supplier riskswe regard the potential impact as significant (2012: major).  However,  we
consider the likelihood of being impacted to such a degree as unlikely. 

20

Therefore,  the Group is committed to delivering outstanding customer
service,  providing our retail partners with the support and tools to
establish and maintain a mutually successful business relationship. 
Customer relationship management is not only a key activity for our
sales force but also of highest importance to our Group's top executives
and second-line management.  As a result,  the Group's CEO as well as
the Executive Board member responsible for Global Sales,  for exampleregularly meet with key customers to ensure a strong partnership
between the Group and its retail customers.  Due to our excellent
relationship with our retail customers and our commitment and
dedication to strengthening our partnerships,  we believe that customer
relationship risks could have a moderate (2012: major) impact on our
Group's performance.  We regard the likelihood of being impacted to
such an extent as possible (2012: unlikely).

Hazard risks
The adidas Group is exposed to external risks such as natural disastersepidemics,  fire,  accidents and malicious acts.  Physical damage to our
own or our suppliers' premises,  production units,  warehouses and stock
in transit can lead to property damage and business interruption. 
These risks are mitigated by loss prevention measures such as working
with reliable suppliers and logistics providers who guarantee high safety
standards.  In addition to the insurance coverage we have secured,  the
Group has also implemented loss prevention (e.g.  sprinklers in facilities)
and contingency plans to quickly recover business activities in order to
minimise potential negative effects. 
We maintain our assessment that the potential financial impact could
be major,  reflecting the fundamental and devastating consequences
natural disasters or terrorist acts might have on our business.  As a
result of the increasing frequency of natural disasters (e.g.  earthquakesfloods,  etc. ) around the world and since we operate in geographies with
 particularly high exposure to natural hazards (e.g.  Japan,  the US West
Coast,  etc. ),  we still assess the likelihood of materialising as possible. 

Personnel risks

Achieving the adidas Group's goal of becoming the global leader in
the sporting goods industry is highly dependent on our employees and
their talents.  In that respect,  we believe that diversity is critical to our
Group's success.  Therefore,  a lack of diversity or the inability to actively
embrace and promote diversity across our global organisation could
result in suboptimal business performance.  Low employee engagement
and the failure to maintain a performance-oriented culture amongst
our workforce could also substantially impede our ability to achieve
our goals.  Furthermore,  the loss of key personnel in strategic positions
and the inability to identify,  recruit and retain sufficient highly qualified
and skilled people who best meet the specific needs of our Group pose
substantial risks to our Group's business performance.  Unattractive
or non-competitive management and employee remuneration may
exacerbate these risks.  In addition,  a lack of sufficient training measures
and inadequate documentation of critical know-how might dilute or lead
to a loss of key capabilities. 

To reduce these risks,  we strongly engage in developing a motivating
working environment and actively promote a way of working that is openhonest,  fact-based,  non-political,  efficient and collaborative.  Our goal is
to make the adidas Group the 'employer of choice" within our industry. 
Attractive reward and incentive schemes are designed to further support
long-term employee commitment  /   EMPLOYEES,  P.  105. 
SEE
With the expansion of our own-retail activities and the continued
growth of our employee base in emerging markets,  employee turnover
may increase in the future.  Moreover,  labour markets are becoming
increasingly more competitive,  with the battle for the most talented
employees constantly intensifying.  As a result of our activities to mitigate
personnel risks,  we now regard the potential impact of personnel risks
as moderate (2012: significant).  However,  we believe the likelihood of
materialising is probable (2012: unlikely). 

IT risks
Key business processes,  including product marketing,  order
management,  warehouse management,  invoice processing,  customer
support and financial reporting,  are all dependent on IT systems.  A
significant systems outage or loss of data could result in considerable
disruptions to our business.  Ineffective project management could
delay the execution of projects critical to the Group or make them more
expensive than planned.  Virus or malware attacks could also lead to
systems disruption and may result in the loss of business-critical and/or
confidential information. 
To mitigate these risks,  our IT organisation proactively engages in system
preventive maintenance,  service continuity planning and adherence to
applicable IT policies.  Data security is managed by restricting user access
based on job description and adhering to data protection regulations. 
Additional security measures such as anti-virus software and firewalls
are designed to further protect our systems and critical information.  We
perform multiple backups at alternating data centre locations for the
Group's core enterprise resource planning system (ERP) on a daily basis. 
In addition,  for the ERP system,  our contingency solution allows us to
quickly switch to a remote site if necessary without any loss of data. 
System security,  controls and reliability are reviewed and tested by the
Internal Audit department.

Product innovation and development risks
Innovative and attractive products generate strong sales and,  more
importantly,  create a halo effect for other products.  Furthermorefulfilling the highest standards in terms of product quality and safety is
critical to sustainable commercial success and forms an integral part of
the product design and development phase.  The speed with which new
product technologies and fresh designs are brought to market is decisive
for maintaining competitive advantage.  In 2013,  all brands generated the
majority of their sales with products which had been brought to market
over the previous 12 to 18 months /   RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENTSEE
P.  99.  If the adidas Group failed to maintain a pipeline of new innovative
products over a sustained period of time,  we would risk a significant
sales decline.  Therefore,  we continue to invest in innovation and design
processes as well as the recruitment and retention of creative and
/ SEE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT,  P.  99.  To ensure
innovative talent    
we can quickly adapt to changing consumer preferences,  we focus on
streamlining research and development processes to speed up the time
to market. 

Raw material and labour costs account for approximately 70% of
the Group's cost of sales.  Prices of materials such as rubber,  cottonpolyester and those which closely correlate with the oil price are
especially subject to the risk of price changes.  As our ordering process
and price negotiations usually take place around six months in advance
of production,  our sourcing function has visibility and reaction time to
reflect sharp increases in input costs in its planning. 
To reduce the financial impact on our product margins from higher
sourcing costs,  we are implementing further lean manufacturing
techniques at our partner factories,  reducing time and cost in the
procurement process,  re-engineering our products and selectively
increasing prices where possible.  In addition,  with respect to material
price increases we engage in risk sharing with our suppliers,  which
dampens the negative effect on the Group's margin.  Furthermore,  the
Profitability Management department is mandated with driving strategic
sourcing initiatives to ensure competitiveness of our supply chain in light
of increasing input costs  /   GLOBAL OPERATIONS,  P.  94.  In the medium
SEE
term,  we also have the ability to adapt our sourcing structure to take
advantage of more competitive pricing in other locations. 
Due to the actions we have taken over the last years to mitigate effects
from increasing input costs,  as well as our continuous efforts in
optimising our supply chain,  we continue to regard the potential impact
related to higher sourcing costs as moderate.  As labour costs continue
to increase across all our major sourcing countries,  we still assess the
likelihood of materialising as likely. 

We believe innovation is a key success factor in the sporting goods
industry and,  as a result,  shortcomings regarding product innovationdesign and development pose a substantial risk to all industry players. 
As a result,  we still evaluate the potential impact of product innovation
and development risks as moderate.  Due to our proven R&D track record
and our strong product pipeline,  however,  we regard the likelihood of
materialising as unlikely (2012: likely). 

adidas Group   /  2013 Annual Report

Due to the critical nature of IT systems for all our business processeswe continue to regard the potential impact as major.  However,  we further
strengthened our risk mitigation in the last twelve months,  in particular
in the areas of IT security and information protection.  Therefore,  we now
consider the likelihood of being affected to such a degree as unlikely
(2012: possible). 

Risks related to rising input costs

IT project risks are further mitigated by utilising a proven project
methodology for all IT projects that includes tight cost control and
regular risk reviews for all major projects.  The IT organisation's strategic
direction is aligned with the adidas Group's overall Route 2015 strategic
business plan.  New quality reviews for major projects have been
implemented to ensure that the progress,  quality and costs of those
projects are regularly evaluated by members of senior management.

Legal & Compliance Risks 
Social and environmental risks 
Legal risks
As a global player,  the adidas Group is exposed to various legal risksincluding contractual risks,  liability risks related to non-contractual
subject matters (e.g.  advertising claims) or the risk of claims and
litigation for infringement of third-party trademarks,  patents and other
rights.  To avoid contract breaches and prevent the Group from entering
into unfavourable contractual agreements,  we continually monitor the
fulfilment of our contractual obligations and constantly involve internal
and external legal experts in all contractual matters.  In addition,  to
reduce the risk of infringing third-party intellectual property rightswe carefully research new product technologies,  designs and names
to identify and avoid potential conflicts with the rights of third parties. 
Our Intellectual Property department drives continuous enhancements
in our patent portfolio,  and in the reviewing and analysis of third-party
patents. 
Despite the process and system (e.g.  contract management)
improvements we made in 2013,  we view the potential impact as
significant should these risks materialise (2012: major) and believe that
the likelihood of materialising is possible.

Risks related to competition,  trade and
customs regulations
Numerous laws and regulations regarding competition,  trade and
customs affect the adidas Group's business practices worldwide. 
Non-compliance with regulations concerning fair competition,  pricingadvertising or product imports (including calculation of customs values)
could lead to substantial financial penalties and additional costs as
well as negative media coverage and therefore reputational damage.  To
proactively manage such risks,  we constantly seek expert legal advice
and provide subject matter training to our employees (e.g.  competition
law training).  In addition,  our internal Legal department advises the
marketing departments to ensure appropriate and compliant brand
communication.  Furthermore,  we work closely with customs authorities
and governments worldwide to make sure we adhere to customs and
import regulations and obtain the required clearance of products to fulfil
sales demand. 
As a result of the growing number of and continuous change in
competition,  trade and customs regulations worldwide,  we now assess
the potential impact on the Group,  should these risks materialise,  as
major (2012: significant) and regard the likelihood of materialising as
possible. 

We have a responsibility to our employees,  suppliers and the
environment.  Malpractice in these areas,  in particular human rights
violations,  dubious employment practices as well as environmentally
harmful production processes can have a significant impact on the
reputation and operational efficiency of our Group and our suppliers. 
To limit this risk,  we have established Workplace Standards to which
suppliers must conform before and during business relationships with
the Group.  Internal and external inspections of supplier factories verified
by extensive independent audits are conducted regularly. 
In the event of non-compliance with these standards,  we develop joint
action plans and set deadlines for compliance.  If these deadlines are
not met,  business relations are terminated  /   SUSTAINABILITY,  P.  111. 
SEE
In order to minimise the environmental impact of producing and
distributing our products,  the adidas Group developed a fully
comprehensive environmental strategy (Environmental Strategy 2015). 
This strategy takes a holistic approach towards environmental issues
such as sustainable resource use,  climate change mitigation,  emissions
to water and air,  waste treatment as well as hazardous substances.   /  
SEE
SUSTAINABILITY,  P.  111. 
Although we believe that social and environmental malpractice may
occur only in isolated cases,  we see increasing corporate social
responsibility obligations for the Group as legislative measures and
consumer expectations with regard to socially and environmentally
sound business practices and behaviour are becoming more demanding. 
Due to this development we will,  for example,  have to cope with rising
costs in order to fulfil more challenging social and environmental
requirements.  However,  because of the experience we have gained
over the last years and due to constant improvements of our social
and environmental activities,  we now consider the potential impact
on the Group as moderate (2012: major) but assess the likelihood of
materialising as likely (2012: possible). 

Risks related to product counterfeiting and imitation
As popular consumer brands which rely on technological and design
innovation as defining characteristics,  the Group's brands are frequent
targets for counterfeiting and imitation.  To reduce the loss of sales and
the potential damage to brand reputation resulting from counterfeit
products,  the adidas Group makes use of extensive legal protection
(generally through registration) and works closely with law enforcement
authorities,  investigators and external legal counsel.  Although we
have stepped up measures such as product security labelling with our
authorised suppliers,  the development of these measures remains a key
priority on an ongoing basis.  In 2013,  around twelve million counterfeit
adidas Group products were seized worldwide.

The adidas Group faces a risk of selling defective products,  which
may result in injury to consumers and/or brand and product image
impairment.  We mitigate this risk by employing dedicated teams that
monitor the quality of our products on all levels of the supply chain
through rigorous testing prior to production,  close cooperation with
suppliers throughout the manufacturing process,  random testing after
retail delivery,  open communication about defective products and quick
settlement of product liability claims when necessary.  In 2013,  we did not
have any notable product recalls. 
We still believe the potential impact of product liability cases or having
to conduct wide-scale product recalls could be significant and,  despite
our internal standards and control activities regarding product qualitywe continue to regard the likelihood of being impacted to such an extent
as possible. 

Fraud and corruption risks
We face the risk that our employees and Executive Board breach
rules and standards that guide appropriate and responsible business
behaviour.  This includes the risks of fraud,  financial misstatements or
manipulation,  bribery and corruption.  Our Group's Fair Play Compliance
Framework helps us manage these risks in a proactive way and enables
us to prevent,  detect and adequately respond in case of fraudulent or
corruptive behaviour.  Our Global Policy Manual provides a framework
for basic work procedures and processes and our Code of Conduct
stipulates that every employee shall act ethically in compliance with the
laws and regulations of the legal systems where they conduct Group
business.  All of our employees have to participate in a special Code of
Conduct training.  In addition,  our Compliance Officers across the Group
guide and advise our operating managers regarding fraud and corruption
topics.  Furthermore,  we utilise controls such as segregation of duties
in IT systems to prevent fraudulent activities.  Whenever reasonable,  we
actively investigate and,  in case of unlawful conduct,  we work with state
authorities to ensure rigorous enforcement of criminal law. 
We believe the potential impact on the Group's performance caused by
fraud,  financial misstatements or manipulation,  bribery and corruption
could be major (2012: significant).  Despite the substantial growth
of our global workforce in recent years,  we regard the likelihood of
being impacted by these risks to such an extent as unlikely,  due to our
preventative measures and controls.  However,  we believe the likelihood
of occurrence of smaller fraud or corruption cases is higher. 

Credit risks
 credit risk arises if a customer or other counterparty to a financial
instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.  The adidas Group
is exposed to credit risks from its operating activities and from certain
financing activities.  Credit risks arise principally from accounts receivable
and,  to a lesser extent,  from other third-party contractual financial
obligations such as other financial assets,  short-term bank deposits
and derivative financial instruments  /   NOTE 28,  P.  222.  Without taking
SEE
into account any collateral,  the carrying amount of financial assets and
accounts receivable represents the maximum exposure to credit risk. 
At the end of 2013,  there was no relevant concentration of credit risk
by type of customer or geography.  Our credit risk exposure is mainly
influenced by individual customer characteristics.  Under the Group's
credit policy,  new customers are analysed for creditworthiness before
standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered. 
Tolerance limits for accounts receivable are also established for each
customer.  Both creditworthiness and accounts receivable limits are
monitored on an ongoing basis.  Customers that fail to meet the Group's
minimum creditworthiness are,  in general,  allowed to purchase products
only on a prepayment basis. 
Other activities to mitigate credit risks include retention of title clauses
as well as,  on a selective basis,  credit insurances,  accounts receivable
sales without recourse and bank guarantees. 
Objective evidence that financial assets are impaired includes,  for
instance,  significant financial difficulty of the issuer or debtor,  indications
of the potential bankruptcy of the borrower and the disappearance of an
active market for a financial asset because of financial difficulties.  The
Group utilises allowance accounts for impairments that represent our
estimate of incurred credit losses with respect to accounts receivable. 
Allowance accounts are used as long as the Group is satisfied that
recovery of the amount due is possible.  Once this is no longer the casethe amounts are considered irrecoverable and are directly written off
against the financial asset.  The allowance consists of two components:
(1)  allowance established for all receivables dependent on the ageing
an
structure of receivables past due date and
(2)  specific allowance that relates to individually assessed risk for

each specific customer irrespective of ageing. 
At the end of 2013,  no Group customer accounted for more than 10% of
accounts receivable.  We still believe that the potential financial impact
of our credit risks from customers could be major but we rate the
likelihood of materialising as unlikely (2012: possible).

such a degree as unlikely.

The adidas Group Treasury department arranges currency and interest
rate hedges,  and invests cash,  with major banks of a high credit standing
throughout the world.  adidas Group companies are authorised to
work with banks rated BBB+ or higher.  Only in exceptional cases are
subsidiaries authorised to work with banks rated lower than BBB+. 
To limit risk in these cases,  restrictions are clearly stipulated,  such
as maximum cash deposit levels.  In addition,  the credit default swap
premiums of our partner banks are monitored on a monthly basis.  In the
event that the defined threshold is exceeded,  credit balances are shifted
to banks compliant with the limit. 
As financial market conditions remain challenging and highly volatile
and due to our overall investment volume,  we believe that the
financial impact could be major (2012: moderate) but the likelihood of
materialising is unlikely.  Furthermore,  we believe our risk concentration
is limited due to the broad distribution of our investment business with
more than 20 banks.  At December 31,  2013,  no bank accounted for more
than 7% of our investments and the average concentration,  including
subsidiaries' short-term deposits in local banks,  was 1%.  This leads to a
maximum exposure of € 100 million in the event of default of any single
bank.  We have further diversified our investment exposure by investing
into AAA-rated money market funds. 

Financing and liquidity risks
Liquidity risks arise from not having the necessary resources available
to meet maturing liabilities with regard to timing,  volume and currency
structure.  In addition,  the adidas Group faces the risk of having to
accept unfavourable financing terms due to liquidity restraints.  Our
Group Treasury department uses an efficient cash management system
to manage liquidity risk.  At December 31,  2013,  Group cash,  cash
equivalents and marketable securities amounted to € 1629 billion (2012:
€ 1935 billion).  Moreover,  our Group maintains € 1652 billion bilateral
credit lines and a € 500 million committed long-term syndicated loan
facility with international banks,  which does not include a market
disruption clause.  The € 2152 billion in credit lines are designed to
ensure sufficient liquidity at all times  /   TREASURY,  P.  135. 
SEE
Future cash outflows arising from financial liabilities that are recognised
in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position are presented in the
following table  /  
TABLE 05. 
This includes payments to settle obligations from borrowings as well as
cash outflows from cash-settled derivatives with negative market values. 
Financial liabilities that may be settled in advance without penalty are
included on the basis of the earliest date of potential repayment.  Cash
flows for variable-interest liabilities are determined with reference to
the conditions at the balance sheet date. 
We ended the year 2013 with net cash of € 295 million (2012:
€ 448 million).  Thus the ratio of net borrowings over EBITDA decreased
to –02 times at year-end,  which is in line with the Group's medium-term
guideline of less than two times.  In light of our available credit linesfinancing structure and business model,  our risk assessment remains
unchanged.  We assess the potential impact of these risks on the Group
as minor and the likelihood of materialising as unlikely. 

In addition,  we held derivatives with a positive fair market value in the
amount of € 59 million.  The maximum exposure to any single bank
resulting from these assets amounted to € 10 million and the average
concentration was 6%.

Currency risks for the adidas Group are a direct result of multi-currency
cash flows within the Group.  Furthermore,  translation impacts from the
conversion of non-euro-denominated results into our Group's functional
currency,  the euro,  might lead to a material negative impact on our
Group's financial performance.  The biggest single driver behind this risk
results from the mismatch of the currencies required for sourcing our
products versus the denominations of our sales.  The vast majority of
our sourcing expenses are in US dollars,  while sales are denominated
in other currencies to a large extent most notably the euro.  Our main
exposures are presented in the adjacent table  /  
TABLE 06.  The exposure
from firm commitments and forecasted transactions was calculated on
 one-year basis. 
In line with IFRS 7 requirements,  we have calculated the impact on
net income and shareholders' equity based on changes in our most
important currency exchange rates.  The calculated impacts mainly
result from fair value changes of our hedging instruments.  The analysis
does not include effects that arise from the translation of our foreign
entities' financial statements into the Group's reporting currency,  the
euro.  The sensitivity analysis is based on the net balance sheet exposureincluding intercompany balances from monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies.  Moreover,  all outstanding currency
derivatives were re-evaluated using hypothetical foreign exchange rates
to determine the effects on net income and equity.  The analysis was
performed on the same basis for both 2012 and 2013.

Based on this analysis,  a 10% increase in the euro versus the US dollar
at December 31,  2013 would have led to a € 2 million increase in net
income.  The more negative market values of the US dollar hedges
would have decreased shareholders' equity by € 176 million.  A 10%
weaker euro at December 31,  2013 would have led to a € 3 million
decrease in net income.  Shareholders' equity would have increased by
€ 214 million  /  
TABLE 07.  The impacts of fluctuations of the US dollar
against the Russian rouble and of the euro against the British pound

majority of our hedging volume secured six months prior to the start
of a given season.  In rare instances,  hedges are contracted beyond
the 24-month horizon.  The Group also largely hedges balance sheet
risks.  Due to our strong global position,  we are able to partly minimise
currency risk by utilising natural hedges.

likely (2012: probable). 

Interest rate risks
Changes in global market interest rates affect future interest payments
for variable-interest liabilities.  As the Group does not have material
variable-interest liabilities,  significant interest rate increases should
have only slight adverse effects on the Group's profitability,  liquidity and
financial position. 

Nevertheless,  our gross US dollar cash flow exposure after natural
hedges calculated for 2014 was roughly € 41 billion at year-end 2013which we hedged using forward contracts,  currency options and currency
swaps  /  
TABLE 06.  Our Group's Treasury Policy allows us to utilise
hedging instruments,  such as currency options or option combinationswhich provide protection from negative exchange rate fluctuations
while at the same time retaining the potential to benefit from future
favourable exchange rate developments in the financial markets. 

In line with IFRS 7 requirements,  we have analysed the impact of
changes in the Group's most important interest rates on net income and
shareholders' equity.  The effect of interest rate changes on future cash
flows is excluded from this analysis.  Nevertheless,  accrued interestwhich is recognised as a liability,  has been re-calculated based on
the hypothetical market interest rates as at December 31,  2013.  Fair
values for derivative interest rate instruments accounted for as cash
flow hedges were then re-evaluated based on the hypothetical market
interest rates with the resulting effects on net income and equity
included in the sensitivity analysis. 

As 2014 hedging has almost been completed,  it is clear that the EUR-USD
conversion rate will improve compared to 2013.  However,  this positive
effect will be more than offset by less favourable rates in the emerging
markets and Japan.  Volume forecast variances,  currency volatility and
an increasing portion of our business in emerging markets,  where
currencies have depreciated rapidly in 2013 and at the beginning of 2014will expose the adidas Group to substantial currency effects in 2014.  Our
financial targets set for 2014 take these trends into consideration  /

Strategic and Operational Opportunities
08   /   Corporate opportunities overview 
In 2013,  interest rates in Europe and North America remained at low
levels.  Given the central banks' current interest rate policies and
macroeconomic uncertainty,  we do not foresee any major interest rate
increases in these regions for the near-term future.  Since 90% of the
Group's financing is in euros and US dollars,  we regard the potential
impact of interest rate risks only as minor and we now regard the
likelihood that these risks will materialise as likely (2012: probable). 

Risk related to impairment of goodwill/other
intangible assets
As a result of various acquisitions in the past,  our balance sheet carries
book values of approximately € 12 billion in goodwill and € 14 billion
in other intangible assets (including trademarks).  Deterioration in the
business performance and particularly in future business prospects
could require corrections of these book values by incurring impairment
charges.  In addition,  increases in market interest rates could trigger
increases in discount rates used in our impairment test for goodwill and
require impairment charges  /   NOTE 02,  P.  195.  An impairment charge
SEE
would be a purely accounting,  non-cash effect impacting the Group's
operating result.  We believe the effects on our financial results related to
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets could be significant. 
However,  we regard the likelihood of a future impairment charge of such
magnitude as unlikely.

Macroeconomic and socio-political opportunities
Since we are a consumer goods company,  consumer confidence and
spending can impact our sales development.  Therefore,  better than
initially forecasted macroeconomic developments,  which support
increased private consumption,  can have a positive impact on our sales
and profitability.  Low unemployment rates,  rising real incomes as well
as a growing middle class with increasing spending power are fuelling
consumption,  particularly in emerging economies and,  subsequentlyour industry.  In addition,  legislative and regulatory changes,  e.g.  the
elimination of trade barriers,  can potentially open new channels of
distribution or lead to lower import costs and positively impact Group
profitability. 
Furthermore,  governments are increasingly promoting living an
active lifestyle to fight obesity and cardiovascular disease.  According
to the latest International Obesity Task Force (IOTF),  more than 600
million adults are currently considered obese.  An additional billion are
estimated to be overweight.  Additionally,  up to 200 million school-age
children are either obese or overweight.  This development has serious
health consequences and a dramatic effect on health care expenditures. 
As a result,  governments and non-governmental organisations are
increasing their efforts to promote a healthy lifestyle and encourage
sports participation.  This could lead to increases in sports participationin particular in categories considered suitable for weight loss,  such as
training,  running and walking.  Given the strong global market position
the adidas Group and its brands enjoy,  acceleration in this trend could
positively affect the Group's sales development.

To reduce interest rate risks and maintain financial flexibility,  a core
tenet of our Group's financial strategy is to continue to use surplus cash
flow from operations to reduce gross borrowings  /   TREASURY,  P.  135.

Beyond that,  the adidas Group is constantly looking for adequate hedging
strategies through interest rate derivatives in order to mitigate interest
rate risks.

The interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift of the
interest yield curve for all currencies and was performed on the same
basis for both 2012 and 2013.  A 100 basis point increase in interest
rates at December 31,  2013 would have increased shareholders' equity
by € 000 million (2012: increase by € 000 million) and decreased net
income by € 000 million (2012: decrease by € 000 million).  A 100 basis
point decrease of the interest rates at December 31,  2013 would have
resulted in a € 000 million decrease in shareholders' equity (2012:
decrease by € 000 million) and a € 000 million increase in net income
(2012: increase by € 000 million).

Other fixed-rate financial instruments are measured at amortised
cost.  Since a change in interest rates would not change the carrying
amount of this category of instruments,  there is no net income impact
and they are excluded from this analysis.

Moreover,  continued growth in the global population,  which is estimated
to exceed nine billion by 2050,  will over time lead to increasing sports
participation and also expand the global consumer base for sports
and sports lifestyle products.  Most of this growth will be in emerging
markets,  which already play an important role in our growth strategy
and where our brands are already well positioned.  This could give an
additional boost to the Group's sales performance. 
Also,  we expect sports participation rates to increase over time,  with
increasing leisure time,  investment in infrastructure and a broadening
of awareness of the benefits of sport.  This is particularly so in countries
such as China or India,  where sports participation is lower than in
industrialised countries.  In addition,  European and North American
sporting goods brands are often seen as highly desirable,  easily
accessible,  affordable quasi-luxury goods in emerging markets,  which
presents an additional growth opportunity. 
As most of these developments are long-term structural opportunities
for the Group's top- and bottom-line performance,  we still assess the
short-term impact as moderate.  Given our ambitious goals,  howeverwe continue to regard the likelihood of such short-term opportunities
materialising as unlikely.

Organic growth opportunities
Controlled space: The sporting goods retail environment is changing
constantly.  We therefore continue to adapt our distribution strategy
to cater for this change and have made controlled space initiatives a
strategic priority.  This includes retail space management with key retail
partners as well as the introduction of new own-retail store formats. 
In our wholesale channels,  we continue to pilot our latest shop-in-shop
concepts globally and have also further invested in unique point-of-sale
activation.  For example,  we have begun to roll out the Reebok FitHub
shop-in-shop concept globally.  We also continued our test phase of the
NEO own-retail store concept in Germany and further expanded our
store base in lower-tier cities in China.  Successful results from these
initiatives and further expansion could enable us to accelerate top- and
bottom-line growth. 
Fashion trends: Trends can rapidly change in our industry as certain
styles,  looks and colourways fall in and out of relevance for the consumer. 
Given our broad product offering,  additional sales opportunities may
arise when our products are more on-trend than those of our major
competitors.  Further establishing a premium price positioning could
strengthen consumers' perception of our brands,  particularly in fashion
categories,  and open up additional margin opportunities. 

Women's: Our Group still generates the majority of its revenues in men's
and unisex categories.  However,  with women accounting for more than
 third of total spending on athletic footwear,  we believe the women's
sports market is one of the most attractive segments in the sporting
goods industry.  The adidas Group is therefore investing in developing
women-specific product offerings in both performance and lifestyle that
emphasise female individuality,  authenticity and style.  Higher traction
from our various initiatives with adidas and Reebok such as specific
adidas campaigns like mygirls or Reebok's expansion into studiobased fitness activities could lead to additional sales opportunities for
the Group. 
New activities and categories: Exploiting the potential of emergingfast-growing sports categories is another organic growth opportunity
for our brands.  Our brand teams conduct market research and engage
in trend marketing to detect changes in lifestyle and consumer needs
of our target audience as early as possible.  Changes in lifestyle,  habits
and attitudes can potentially result in the emergence of new consumer
needs that are not addressed by current product offerings.  For examplewe see a growing trend in the move by athletes and sports enthusiasts
towards more minimalistic products that promote natural body
movement.  In order to tap into this opportunity,  we are expanding our
efforts to bring to market more lightweight and flexible products that
support the athlete's natural course of motion.  In addition,  we continue
to see new exciting fitness concepts spring up such as CrossFit and
obstacle racing.  Similarly,  we see tremendous growth potential in the
outdoor and action sports categories and intend to become a leading
player in these categories over the next few years.  In this respect,  under
the adidas Originals banner,  we launched our very first snowboard
collection,  featuring three distinct snowboarding boots and roughly 60
articles of snowboarding apparel.  Depending on how long it takes to
build the needed credibility with the target consumers,  the outdoor and
action sports categories may perform better than currently assumed in
our projections. 
Customisation and personalisation: Today's consumers are looking
for choice and variety that go beyond choosing from a wide selection of
products.  We engage in developing unique and relevant products that fit
specific functional and aesthetic requirements.  For example,  the adidasReebok and TaylorMade brands all offer different personalisation
and customisation platforms reflecting each brand's strategy.  With
mi adidas and YourReebok,  consumers can design and order completely
customised adidas and Reebok footwear online,  thereby creating their
own unique style.  This is a particularly relevant opportunity in the kids'
segment.  In addition,  TaylorMade-adidas Golf's Centres of Excellence
provide customised fitting sessions for golfers with expert fitters and
technicians.  We expect the market for personalised and customised
footwear,  apparel and hardware to grow strongly and evolve further in
the coming years,  which might support additional sales growth for the
Group.

Digital interactivity: Consumer demand for digital interactivity has
increased significantly in recent years as consumers realise the benefits
of incorporating real-time data on metrics such as distance,  speed and
heart rate into their training routines and into their performance on the
field.  The design and development of this functionality requires different
expertise,  product and material research as well as production know-how
compared to traditional footwear and apparel.  Our resources and our
positioning as a sport performance leader as well as collaborations
with experts in technology and in the field of analysing data related to
athletes' movement and performance are beginning to open up new
opportunities.  For example,  in November 2013,  we launched the most
advanced and intuitive wrist-based running device on the market,  the
adidas miCoach Smart Run.  For the first time,  runners are able to track
their runs using GPS mapping,  monitor their heart rate from their wrist
with optical technology,  listen to their favourite music and get real-time
coaching by our miCoach system all in one touchscreen device without
cables or straps /   RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT,  P.  99.  As consumer
SEE
demand for wearable functional devices increases,  and with further
advances in technology,  we expect this market could offer significant
potential and opportunities as we continue to invest to drive credibility
in the space. 

Taking all these together,  we see many long-term organic growth
opportunities and still regard the potential impact as major.  Howevergiven our ambitious goals,  we believe the likelihood of being positively
affected to such an extent in the short term is unlikely (2012: possible). 

Sustainable products: As consumers demand more products that are
environmentally benign and produced on a sustainable basis,  the adidas
Group continues its efforts to create meaningful product platforms
that drive growth in this area.  We remain focused on the extension of
the adidas "Better Place" programme.  Products and packaging in the
programme are designed taking sustainability principles into accountsuch as broadening the use of recycled materials and monitoring energy
use in material and product preparation.  For example,  in September
2013,  adidas by Stella McCartney introduced its spring/summer 2014
collection that incorporated sustainable elements wherever possible. 
Advanced,  eco-friendly cutting techniques ensure 95% of fabric used
creates the final product,  with the remaining 5% recycled or repurposedso that no surplus material goes to waste.  Organic cotton,  recycled yarn
and DryDye pieces in each range complete the sustainable offering  /  
SEE
SUSTAINABILITY,  P.  111. 

Furthermore,  constant improvements in manufacturing excellence
(e.g.  process simplification),  manufacturing innovation or warehouse
consolidation,  may help us increase efficiency and profitability for
the Group.  Innovations in production could also support the Group in
reducing its environmental impact,  while at the same time enabling the
Group to provide consumers with the best value proposition possible. 
For example,  a higher level of automation in the production processes
for footwear and apparel manufacturing could result in productivity
enhancements,  shorten lead times and improve overall quality. 

Strategic partnerships: The adidas Group is constantly evolving
its partnership network within sports and culture,  with academic
organisations and other industries in research and developmentdesigners in the fashion industry,  other brands and non-traditional
sporting goods retailers.  These partnerships have generated multiple
new growth avenues for the Group,  as we have acquired product or
process know-how and gained access to new distribution channels or
markets.  For example,  at the end of 2013,  together with partners the
adidas Group announced its leading position in the research project
'Speedfactory" under the umbrella of the German government.  The
intention of this project is to shape the future of manufacturing and come
up with innovative products as well as new production technologies
specifically taking into account future consumer needs,  speed,  flexibility
and sustainability.  Therefore,  partnership collaborations in the future
may enable the adidas Group to pursue further growth and efficiency
opportunities. 

Opportunities related to organisational and
process improvements
Continued optimisation of key business processes and strict cost
control are vital to achieving high profitability and return on invested
capital.  We are confident that there is still significant opportunity to
further streamline cost structures throughout our Group.  For examplewe continuously search for ways to increase efficiency in our supply
chain and make it truly demand-driven.  Furthermore,  by implementing
end-to-end planning processes and improving our replenishment
capabilities,  we see opportunities not only to better serve our customers
but also to reduce our operating working capital needs.  Another
example in this respect is the reduction of the number of articles; this
reduces complexity and workload in the creation area and warehouse
costs,  and allows us to offer more focused and consistent ranges to our
retail partners. 

In addition,  consolidating and upgrading our distribution centres
represents an opportunity for the Group to realise further efficiency
gains,  reduce operating overheads and provide the operational ability
to drive additional revenue growth and working capital improvements. 
Process improvements in other areas of the Group's business activities
could also positively impact profitability.  For example,  further centralising
ranging and product purchasing for our own-retail business could lead
to an increase in efficiency and drive additional sales,  thus helping us
increase overall Group profitability.  A consolidated and global approach
with respect to non-trade purchasing may also increase efficiency and
help us generate cost savings.  Furthermore,  consolidation of back-office
functions as part of our reorganisation initiatives in Western Europe
and North America,  but also in other markets,  could foster process
harmonisation,  eliminate redundancy and reduce operating overheads.

Overall,  we continue to view the potential impact of organisational
and process improvements as significant.  Given that benefits from our
numerous initiatives to improve efficiency and operational excellence
have already been reflected in our targets for 2014 and 2015,  we
now regard the likelihood that additional opportunities related to
organisational and process improvements materialise to such an extent
only as possible (2012: likely). 

Marketing and communication opportunities 
20

13

178

Advances in digital communication offer significant opportunities for our
brands to engage with consumers in a deeper and more meaningful wayand enhance our potential to build long-lasting relationships and brand
loyalty.  The adidas Group constantly monitors the latest developments
and trends in communication technologies.  The emergence of social
media and social networks is one such example which is helping our
brands increase their consumer reach.  In this regard,  we are investing
considerable resources to present the adidas Group's brands through
 variety of social media platforms,  such as Facebook,  YouTube or
Twitter  /   GLOBAL BRANDS STRATEGY,  P.  77.  A key advantage of these
SEE
tools is that they allow our brands to engage in a direct dialogue with our
consumers.  By offering consumers the opportunity to actively participate
in brand campaigns or in the design and creation of new products,  we
can generate a far superior brand experience.  In 2013,  we introduced
Brazuca,  the official 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil match ball,  which was
named following a public vote in Brazil involving one million football
fans.  Furthermore,  as consumer demand for personalised experiences
and continuous access to fresh content increases,  we are establishing
global newsrooms,  staffed with 'brand journalists" in key locationsstarting with Rio de Janeiro,  London,  Portland and Shanghai,  creating
content,  providing community management,  customer relationship
management and analytics across various time zones /   GLOBAL
SEE
BRANDS STRATEGY,  P.  77. 
Another opportunity for the Group is the activation of promotion
partnerships with individual high-profile athletes as well as global
icons such as Lionel Messi for adidas football or Kanye West for adidas
Originals.  Depending on their success and popularity,  as well as our
ability to sign new future iconic partnerships,  this could generate
additional sales for the Group via signature product lines and design
collaborations as well as increase brand equity.  While we believe there
is significant long-term potential for future opportunities in this areain the short term,  we assess the potential impact of marketing and
communication opportunities as minor (2012: significant).  Despite our
strong portfolio of promotion partnerships with world-class athletes in
key sports,  we regard the likelihood that those opportunities materialise
to such an extent in the short term only as possible (2012: likely). 

Acquisition opportunities
Although the Group's focus is on organic growth initiatives,  we consider
acquisitions of smaller,  fast-growing or innovative companies as an
opportunity to generate additional sales and profits.  Furthermoreacquisition opportunities may arise as a result of challenging
macroeconomic and competitive conditions that could lead to financial
distress of companies which,  while not as financially healthy as industry
leaders,  possess certain assets that could help the adidas Group further
improve its business performance.  However,  we still regard the potential
impact of acquisition opportunities only as minor and the likelihood that
such opportunities materialise as possible. 

Personnel opportunities
Recruiting highly qualified employees,  in particular for our own-retail
segment,  may help us generate better than expected top- and
bottom-line results.  For example,  a reduction of the attrition rates in
our own-retail stores could increase conversion rates as well as store
productivity and also lead to lower expenses for recruiting activities. 
In addition,  successfully establishing a performance culture as well as
developing key talents across the Group may contribute positively to
sales and profitability improvements.  As a result,  we continue to believe
the potential impact of such opportunities is significant,  and we still
assess the likelihood of an impact of such magnitude in the short term
as unlikely. 

Financial Opportunities
Favourable financial market changes
Favourable exchange and interest rate developments can potentially
have a positive impact on the Group's financial results.  Our Group
Treasury department closely monitors the financial markets to identify
and exploit opportunities /  
SEE TREASURY,  P.  135.  Translation effects
from the conversion of non-euro-denominated results into our Group's
functional currency,  the euro,  might positively impact our Group's
financial performance.  Overall,  we believe favourable exchange rate
and interest rate developments could have a major potential impact.  We
continue to assess the likelihood of being positively affected to such an
extent as unlikely.

Assessment of performance versus targets
We communicate our Group's financial targets on an annual basis.  We
also provide updates throughout the year as appropriate  /  
TABLE 01.  In
2013,  the adidas Group delivered a solid financial performance,  despite
macroeconomic challenges in many regions,  with currency-neutral
/ SEE
Group sales growth outperforming macroeconomic growth   
ECONOMIC AND SECTOR DEVELOPMENT,  P.  122. 
As a result of intensified currency translation headwinds,  distribution
constraints due to a warehouse issue and a softer consumer
environment in Russia/CIS as well as an overall weakness in the golf
market,  we lowered our full year 2013 guidance in September,  compared
to our initial expectations. 

20

180

In 2013,  Group revenues rose 3% on a currency-neutral basis,  mainly due
to growth in emerging markets as well as the further expansion of our
own-retail activities.  Group revenues increased below our initial guidance
of a mid-single-digit currency-neutral increase.  This was driven by lower
sales growth than originally expected in Russia/CIS and at TaylorMadeadidas Golf.  Gross margin increased 15 percentage points to 493%above our initial expectations of 480% to 485%.  This development was
due to a more favourable pricing,  product and regional sales mix as well
as strong improvements in the Reebok brand gross margin.  Operating
margin excluding goodwill impairment losses improved 07 percentage
points to 87%.  This development was slightly below our initial guidance
of approaching 90%,  as operating expenses as a percentage of sales
were higher than originally forecasted.  This was mainly due to the lower
top-line growth as well as the faster expansion of own-retail activities
than originally planned.  As a result,  basic and diluted earnings per share
excluding goodwill impairment losses were € 401 and thus below our
initial guidance of € 425 to € 440.  This result was mainly due to negative
currency translation effects,  which significantly impacted our reported
results in 2013,  as well as the lower sales growth in Russia/CIS and at
TaylorMade-adidas Golf  /   INCOME STATEMENT,  P.  125. 
SEE

Beyond our financial performance,  we also actively monitor the Group's
key non-financial KPIs on a regular basis,  as available  /   INTERNAL
SEE
GROUP MANAGEMENT SYSTEM,  P.  118.  From a market share perspective,  we
continue to be very encouraged by our strong performance compared to
our major competitors in key emerging markets.  In particular,  Greater
China and Latin America were notable standouts,  as we significantly
improved our market share in both regions in 2013.  Less pleasinghowever,  was our underperformance in key developed markets such
as the USA and Western Europe.  Nevertheless,  in these markets,  we
have seen signs of improvement towards the end of 2013,  driven by
product launches in key categories such as football and running.  Finally
in the golf market,  despite a challenging year for the entire industrywe continue to enjoy healthy market share positions.  In metalwoodsour market shares remain well above 30% in the USA and Western
Europe,  slightly lower than the prior year.  In both irons and footwear,  we
increased market share in nearly all key regions in 2013. 
Despite the distribution challenges we faced in Russia/CIS,  we continued
to maintain a good level of on-time in-full deliveries to our customers
and own-retail stores in 2013 /  
SEE GLOBAL OPERATIONS,  P.  94.  As in
prior years,  the majority of our sales in 2013 were again generated
from products launched in the past 12 to 18 months.  In addition,  we
received several awards and industry recognitions for our new product
innovations  /   RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT,  P.  99.  At a Group level,  we
SEE
also completed our most comprehensive employee engagement survey
during 2013.  The result was satisfactorily on average with the benchmark
of our external provider,  with improvements in several areas since our
last survey in 2010 /   EMPLOYEES,  P.  105.  Finally,  our diligence and
SEE
discipline in sustainability matters continues to yield strong recognition
for our Group.  For the 14th consecutive time,  we were selected to join
the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes (DJSI) and were named industry
leader in sustainability issues and corporate responsibility in the
category 'Clothing,  Accessories & Footwear" for the tenth time  /  
SEE
SUSTAINABILITY,  P.  111. 

In 2013,  operating working capital and cash management were negatively
impacted by increased working capital requirements towards the end of
the year.  While we had expected average operating working capital as
a percentage of sales to increase moderately in 2013,  our challenges
in Russia/CIS resulted in slightly higher inventories and,  as a resulta stronger increase than we had initially expected  /   STATEMENT OF

Assessment of financial outlook
Since the adidas Group publicly announced its Route 2015 strategic
business plan in 2010,  we have made good progress towards our Route
2015 aspirations.  We remain focused on creating long-term sustainable
shareholder value and continue to pursue all targets with utmost
diligence. 

In 2014,  we will see a specific emphasis on returning our Group to
higher currency-neutral growth rates than seen in 2013,  while also
continuing to pursue initiatives to improve our Group's operating margin
in the medium to long term.  We will also continue to invest in future
growth opportunities by utilising the upcoming 2014 FIFA World Cup
and innovation platforms such as Boost,  expanding our digital activities
as well as opening new retail stores /   GLOBAL BRANDS STRATEGYSEE
P.  77  /  
GLOBAL SALES STRATEGY,  P.  72. 
Through our extensive pipeline of new and innovative products,  which
have received favourable reviews from retailers,  we project top- and
bottom-line improvements in our Group's financial results in 2014.  This
is supported by positive order backlogs and improving comparable store
growth trends in our own-retail stores compared to the prior year.  Gross
margin expansion,  resulting from a more favourable pricing,  product and
regional sales mix,  is expected to have a positive impact on the Group's
profitability.  In addition,  we project that other operating expenses as a
percentage of sales will be around the prior year level.  We believe that
our outlook for 2014 is realistic within the scope of the current trading
and economic environment  /   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS AND OUTLOOK,  P.  151. 
SEE
Assuming no significant deterioration in the global economy,  we are
confident to further increase sales and profitability in 2015,  as we
continue to drive operational progress towards our Route 2015 strategic
business plan aspirations /   GROUP STRATEGY,  P.  68.  However,  given
SEE
further headwinds from the weakening of several currencies versus
the euro since the beginning of 2014,  we believe there is higher risk to
the achievement of our stated financial goals and aspirations than in
prior years.  No other material event between the end of 2013 and the
publication of this report has altered our view.

The Group's Risk Management team aggregates all risks and
opportunities reported by different business units and functions through
the quarterly risk and opportunity assessment process.  In additionthe Group's Executive Board discusses and assesses Group risks and
opportunities on a regular basis.  Taking into account the potential
financial impact as well as the likelihood of materialising of the risks
explained within this report,  and considering the strong balance
sheet as well as the current business outlook,  we do not foresee any
material jeopardy to the viability of the Group as a going concern.  This
assessment is also supported by the historical response to our financing
demands  /   TREASURY,  P.  135.  The adidas Group therefore has not
SEE
sought an official rating by any of the leading rating agencies.  We remain
confident that the Group's earnings strength forms a solid basis for our
future business development and provides the resources necessary
to pursue the opportunities available to the Group.  Compared to the
prior year,  our assessment of certain risks has changed in terms of
likelihood of occurrence and/or potential financial impact  /   RISK AND
SEE
OPPORTUNITY REPORT,  P.  158.  The partial changes in risk evaluation have
no substantial impact on the overall adidas Group risk profile; howeverwe believe that the current development of major currencies since the
beginning of 2014 will make the achievement of our financial targets for
2014 and 2015 significantly more challenging to meet.

Auditor's Report
We have audited the consolidated financial statements prepared by adidas AG,  Herzogenaurach,  comprising the statement
of financial position,  income statement,  statement of comprehensive income,  statement of changes in equity,  statement of
cash flows and the notes,  together with the management report of the Company and the Group for the business year from
January 1 to December 31,  2013.  The preparation of the consolidated financial statements and the Group management
report in accordance with IFRS,  as adopted by the EU,  and the additional requirements of German commercial law
pursuant to § 315a (1) HGB (Handelsgesetzbuch 'German Commercial Code") is the responsibility of the Company's
Executive Board.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and on the Group
management report based on our audit. 

Our audit has not led to any reservations. 
In our opinion,  based on the findings of our audit,  the consolidated financial statements comply with IFRS,  as adopted by
the EU,  and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315a (1) HGB and give a true and fair
view of the net assets,  financial position and profit or loss of the Group in accordance with these requirements.  The Group
management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and as a whole provides a suitable view of the
Group's position and suitably presents the opportunities and risks of future development.

We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with § 317 HGB and German generally
accepted standards for the audit of financial statements promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (Institute of
Public Auditors in Germany) (IDW).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit such that misstatements
materially affecting the presentation of the net assets,  financial position and profit or loss in the consolidated financial
statements in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework and in the Group management report are
detected with reasonable assurance.  Knowledge of the business activities and the economic and legal environment of the
Group and expectations as to possible misstatements are taken into account in the determination of audit procedures. 
The effectiveness of the accounting-related internal control system and the evidence supporting the disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements and the Group management report are examined primarily on a test basis within
the framework of the audit.  The audit includes assessing the annual financial statements of the entities included in
consolidation,  the determination of entities to be included in consolidation,  the accounting and consolidation principles
used and significant estimates made by management,  as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated
financial statements and Group management report.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

New standards and interpretations as well as amendments to existing standards and interpretations are usually
not applied by the Group before the effective date,  with the exception of the following standard:
/  IAS 36 Amendment Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets (effective date: January 12014): By applying this amendment early,  the unintentionally introduced requirement to disclose the recoverable

The consolidated financial statements have in principle been prepared on the historical cost basis with the
exception of certain items in the statement of financial position such as financial instruments valued at fair
value through profit or loss,  available-for-sale financial assets,  derivative financial instruments,  plan assets and
receivables,  which are measured at fair value. 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros (€) and all values are rounded to the
nearest million (€ in millions). 

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the consolidation,  accounting and
valuation principles described below. 

Principles of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of adidas AG and all its direct and indirect
subsidiaries,  which are prepared in accordance with uniform accounting principles.  A company is considered
 subsidiary if it is controlled by adidas AG,  e.g.  by holding the majority of the voting rights and/or directly or
indirectly governing the financial and operating policies of the respective enterprise. 
The number of consolidated subsidiaries evolved as follows for the years ending December 31,  2013 and
December 31,  2012,  respectively:

SEE SHAREHOLDINGS OF ADIDAS AG,  HERZOGENAURACH,  P.  240.  Furthermore,  the schedule of the
shareholdings of adidas AG will be published on the electronic platform of the German Federal Gazette. 
Within the scope of the first-time consolidation,  all acquired assets and liabilities are recognised in the
statement of financial position at fair value at the acquisition date.  A debit difference between the acquisition
cost and the proportionate fair value of assets,  liabilities and contingent liabilities is shown as goodwill.  A credit
difference is recorded in the income statement. 
Acquisitions of additional investments in subsidiaries which are already controlled are recorded as equity
transactions.  Therefore,  neither fair value adjustments of assets and liabilities nor gains or losses are recognised. 
Any difference between the cost for such an additional investment and the carrying amount of the net assets at the
acquisition date is directly recorded in shareholders' equity. 
The financial effects of intercompany transactions,  as well as any unrealised gains and losses arising from
intercompany business relations are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.

Currency translation
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the respective functional currency by applying the spot
exchange rate valid at the transaction date to the foreign currency amount. 
In the individual financial statements of subsidiaries,  monetary items denominated in non-functional
currencies of the subsidiaries are generally translated into the functional currency at closing exchange rates at
the balance sheet date.  The resulting currency gains and losses are recorded directly in the income statement. 
Assets and liabilities of the Group's non-euro functional currency subsidiaries are translated into the
presentation currency,  the euro,  which is also the functional currency of adidas AG,  at closing exchange rates
at the balance sheet date.  For practical reasons,  revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for
the period which approximate the exchange rates on the transaction dates.  All cumulative differences from the
translation of equity of foreign subsidiaries resulting from changes in exchange rates are included in a separate
item within shareholders' equity without affecting the income statement.

Derivative financial instruments 
adidas Group   /  2013 Annual Report 
13

197
20

The Group uses derivative financial instruments,  such as currency options,  forward contracts as well as interest
rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps,  to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate
risks.  In accordance with its Treasury Policy,  the Group does not enter into transactions with derivative financial
instruments for trading purposes. 
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised in the statement of financial position at fair valueand subsequently also measured at their fair value.  The method of recognising the resulting gains or losses is
dependent on the nature of the hedge.  On the date a derivative contract is entered into,  the Group designates
derivatives as either a hedge of a forecasted transaction (cash flow hedge),  a hedge of the fair value of a recognised
asset or liability (fair value hedge) or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign entity. 
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges,  and that are
effective,  as defined in IAS 39 'Financial instruments: recognition and measurement",  are recognised in equity. 
When the effectiveness is not 100%,  the ineffective portion of the change in the fair value is recognised in the
income statement.  Accumulated gains and losses in equity are transferred to the income statement in the same
periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects the income statement. 
For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges,  the gains or losses on the derivatives and the
offsetting gains or losses on the hedged items are recognised immediately in the income statement. 
Certain derivative transactions,  while providing effective economic hedges under the Group's risk management
policies,  may not qualify for hedge accounting under the specific rules of IAS 39.  Changes in the fair value of any
derivative instruments that do not meet these rules are recognised immediately in the income statement. 
Hedges of net investments in foreign entities are accounted for in a similar way to cash flow hedges.  If,  for
example,  the hedging instrument is a derivative (e.g.  a forward contract) or,  for example,  a foreign currency
borrowing,  effective currency gains and losses in the derivative and all gains and losses arising on the translation
of the borrowing,  respectively,  are recognised in equity. 
The Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedge objects at transaction
inception,  as well as the risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions. 
This process includes linking all derivatives designated as hedges to specific firm commitments and forecasted
transactions.  The Group also documents its assessment of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging
transactions are highly effective by using different methods of effectiveness testing,  such as the 'dollar offset
method" or the 'hypothetical derivative method". 
The fair values of forward contracts and currency options are determined on the basis of market conditions
on the reporting dates.  The fair value of a currency option is determined using generally accepted models to
calculate option prices.  The fair market value of an option is influenced not only by the remaining term of the
option but also by additional factors,  such as the actual foreign exchange rate and the volatility of the underlying
foreign currency base.  Fair values are determined taking into consideration the counterparty risk.  Due to
immateriality,  no adjustment has been recorded.  The adidas Group has exercised the option to calculate the
amounts on counterparty level according to IFRS 13 'Fair Value Measurement",  paragraph 48.

Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents represent cash at banks,  cash on hand and short-term deposits with maturities of
three months or less from the date of acquisition. 
Cash equivalents are short-term,  highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of
cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 

Receivables and other financial assets
Receivables and other financial assets are recognised at fair value,  which corresponds to the nominal value for
current receivables and other financial assets.  For non-current receivables and other financial assets,  the fair
value is estimated as the present value of future cash flows discounted at the market rate of interest at the
balance sheet date.  Subsequently,  these are measured at amortised cost using the 'effective interest method". 
Required allowances,  if necessary,  are determined on the basis of individual risk assessments,  and on the ageing
structure of receivables past due. 

Inventories
Merchandise and finished goods are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value,  which is the estimated
selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs
necessary to make the sale.  Costs are determined using a standard valuation method: the 'average cost method". 
Costs of finished goods include cost of raw materials,  direct labour and the components of the manufacturing
overheads which can reasonably be attributed.  The allocation of overheads is based on the planned average
utilisation.  The net realisable value allowances are computed consistently throughout the Group based on the age
and expected future sales of the items on hand. 

Assets/liabilities classified as held for sale
Assets/liabilities classified as held for sale are primarily non-current assets and liabilities expected to be
recovered principally through sale rather than through continuing use.  These are measured at the lower of their
carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.  Assets classified as held for sale are not depreciated on a
straight-line basis. 

20

13

198

Property,  plant and equipment
Property,  plant and equipment are measured at amortised cost.  This comprises any costs directly attributable
to bringing the asset to the condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by
Management less accumulated depreciation (except for land and construction in progress) and accumulated
impairment losses.  Depreciation is recognised over the estimated useful life utilising the 'straight-line method"
and taking into account any potential residual value,  except where the 'declining-balance method" is more
appropriate in light of the actual utilisation pattern.  Parts of an item of property,  plant and equipment with a cost
that is significant in relation to the total cost of the item are depreciated separately. 
Land leases are measured at the lower of the fair value or the present value of minimum lease payments and
are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the contractually agreed lease term. 
Estimated useful lives are as follows:

Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.  Renewals and improvements are capitalised
and depreciated separately,  if the recognition criteria are met.

Impairment losses
If facts and circumstances indicate that non-current assets (e.g.  property,  plant and equipment,  intangible assets
including goodwill and certain financial assets) might be impaired,  the recoverable amount is determined.  It is
measured at the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and value in use.  An impairment loss is recognised
in other operating expenses or reported separately if the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount.  If
there is an impairment loss for a cash-generating unit,  first the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to
the cash-generating unit is reduced,  and subsequently,  provided that the recoverable amount is lower than the
carrying amount,  the other non-current assets of the unit are reduced pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount
of each asset in the unit. 
Irrespective of whether there is an impairment indication,  intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and
goodwill acquired in business combinations are tested annually for impairment. 
An impairment loss recognised in goodwill is not reversible.  With respect to all other impaired assets,  an
impairment loss recognised in prior periods is reversed affecting the income statement if there has been a change
in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.  An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent
that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of
depreciation or amortisation) if no impairment loss had been recognised. 

Leases 
20

Intangible assets (except goodwill)	
Intangible assets are valued at amortised cost less accumulated amortisation (except for assets with indefinite
useful lives) and impairment losses.  Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis taking into account any
potential residual value. 
Expenditures during the development phase of internally generated intangible assets are capitalised as
incurred if they qualify for recognition under IAS 38 'Intangible Assets". 
Estimated useful lives are as follows:

The adidas Group determined that there was no impairment necessary for any of its trademarks with indefinite
useful lives in the years ending December 31,  2013 and 2012.  In addition,  an increase in the discount rate of up to
approximately 15% or a reduction of cash inflows of up to approximately 20% would not result in any impairment
requirement.

Under finance lease arrangements,  the substantial risks and rewards associated with an asset are transferred
to the lessee.  At the beginning of the lease arrangement,  the respective asset and a corresponding liability are
recognised at the fair value of the asset or,  if lower,  the net present value of the minimum lease payments. 
For subsequent measurement,  minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance expense and the
reduction of the outstanding liability.  The finance expense is allocated to each period during the lease term so as
to produce a constant periodic interest rate on the remaining balance of the liability.  In addition,  depreciation and
any impairment losses for the associated assets are recognised.  Depreciation is performed over the lease term
or,  if shorter,  over the useful life of the asset. 
Under operating lease agreements,  rent expenses are recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of
the lease.

The recoverable amount is determined on the basis of fair value less costs to sell (costs to sell are calculated with
1% of the fair value).  The fair value is determined in discounting notional royalty savings after tax and adding a tax
amortisation benefit,  resulting from the amortisation of the acquired asset ('relief-from-royalty method").  These
calculations use projections of net sales related royalty savings,  based on financial planning which covers a period
of four years in total.  The level of the applied royalty rate for the determination of the royalty savings is based on
contractual agreements between the adidas Group and external licensees as well as publicly available royalty rate
agreements for similar assets.  Notional royalty savings beyond this period are extrapolated using steady growth
rates of 17% (2012: 17%).  The growth rates do not exceed the long-term average growth rate of the business to
which the trademarks are allocated. 
The discount rate is based on a weighted average cost of capital calculation derived using a five-year average
market-weighted debt/equity structure and financing costs referencing the Group's major competitors.  The
discount rate used is an after-tax rate and reflects the specific equity and country risk.  The applied discount rate
depends on the respective intangible asset being valued and ranges between 68% and 88% (2012: between 65%
and 84%). 

Goodwill 
20

13

200

Goodwill is an asset representing the future economic benefits arising from assets acquired in a business
combination that are not individually identified and separately recognised.  This results when the purchase cost
exceeds the fair value of acquired identifiable assets,  liabilities and contingent liabilities.  Goodwill arising from
the acquisition of a foreign entity and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets,  liabilities
and contingent liabilities of that foreign entity are treated as assets,  liabilities and contingent liabilities of the
respective reporting entity,  and are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the date of the initial consolidation. 
Goodwill is carried in the functional currency of the acquired foreign entity. 
Acquired goodwill is valued at cost and is tested for impairment on an annual basis and additionally when
there are indications of potential impairment. 
The cash-generating units are defined as the geographic regions (split into wholesale and retail) which are
responsible for the joint distribution of adidas and Reebok as well as the other operating segments TaylorMadeadidas Golf,  Rockport and Reebok-CCM Hockey.  The number of cash-generating units amounted to a total of 32
in 2013 and 2012,  respectively. 
The cash-generating units (or groups of units) represent the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill
is monitored for internal management purposes.  The impairment test for goodwill has been performed based on
cash-generating units (or groups of units). 
The recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is determined on the basis of value in use.  This calculation
uses cash flow projections based on the financial planning covering a four-year period in total.  The planning is
based on the adidas Group's strategic business plan 'Route 2015"  /   GROUP STRATEGY,  P.  68 until 2015 and was
SEE
prolonged by two further years based on historical and expected growth prospects and margin developments until
2015.  It reflects an expected mid- to high-single-digit sales increase for the majority of the cash-generating units
(or groups of units).  For a few emerging markets as well as Rockport,  we expect,  on average,  a low-double-digit
sales growth rate.  Furthermore,  we expect the operating margin to expand,  primarily driven by an improvement
in the gross margin as well as lower operating expenses as a percentage of sales.  The planning for capital
expenditure and working capital is primarily based on past experience.  The planning for future tax payments is
based on current statutory corporate tax rates of the single cash-generating units (or groups of units).  Cash flows
beyond this four-year period are extrapolated using steady growth rates of 17% (2012: 17%).  According to our
expectations,  these growth rates do not exceed the long-term average growth rate of the business in which each
cash-generating unit operates.

Discount rates are based on a weighted average cost of capital calculation considering a five-year average
market-weighted debt/equity structure and financing costs referencing the Group's major competitors for each
cash-generating unit (or groups of units).  The discount rates used are after-tax rates and reflect the specific
equity and country risk of the relevant cash-generating unit. 
In total,  goodwill impairment losses of € 52 million have been recognised in 2013 (2012: € 265 million).  Within
the Wholesale segment,  goodwill impairment losses amounted to € 23 million in Iberia,  and within the Retail
segment goodwill impairment losses amounted to € 29 million in North America.  The goodwill of the respective
cash-generating units is completely impaired.  The impairment losses were mainly caused by adjusted growth
assumptions and an increase in the country-specific discount rates.  In 2012,  within the Wholesale segmentgoodwill impairment losses amounted to € 106 million in North America,  € 41 million in Latin America,  € 15 million
in Brazil and € 11 million in Iberia.  Additionally,  in 2012,  goodwill of € 68 million allocated to Reebok-CCM Hockey
was completely impaired and € 24 million allocated to Rockport was partially impaired. 
 change in the discount rate by approximately 15% or a reduction of planned free cash inflows by
approximately 20% would result in complete impairment requirement for the cash-generating units Retail Japan
(goodwill € 8 million),  Retail South Europe (goodwill € 7 million) and Retail Brazil (goodwill € 2 million) as well
as Rockport (goodwill € 28 million).  For all other cash-generating units,  even an increase in the discount rate
by approximately 4% or a reduction of planned free cash inflows by approximately 30% would not result in any
additional impairment requirement. 
The carrying amounts of acquired goodwill allocated to the respective groups of cash-generating units and
the respective discount rates applied to the cash flow projections are as follows:

Financial assets
All purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade date.  Costs of purchases include transaction
costs.  Available-for-sale financial assets include non-derivative financial assets which are not allocable under
another category of IAS 39.  If their respective fair value can be measured reliably,  they are subsequently carried at
fair value.  If this is not the case,  these are measured at amortised cost.  Realised and unrealised gains and losses
arising from changes in the fair value of financial assets are included in the income statement for the period in
which they arise,  except for available-for-sale financial assets where unrealised gains and losses are recognised
in equity unless they are impaired. 

Borrowings and other liabilities
Borrowings and other liabilities are recognised at fair value using the 'effective interest method",  net of
transaction costs incurred.  In subsequent periods,  long-term borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the
'effective interest method".  Any difference between proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value
is recognised in the income statement over the term of the borrowing. 
In 2012,  adidas AG issued a convertible bond which grants the holder the right to convert the bond into
adidas AG shares.  The number of underlying shares is fixed and does not vary subject to the fair value of the
shares. 
Compound financial instruments (e.g.  convertible bonds) are divided into a liability component shown under
borrowings and into an equity component resulting from conversion rights.  The equity component is included
in the capital reserve.  The fair value of the liability component is determined by discounting the interest and
principal payments of a comparable liability without conversion rights,  applying risk-adjusted interest rates.  The
liability component is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 'effective interest method".  The equity
component is determined as the difference between the fair value of the total compound financial instrument and
the fair value of the liability component and is reported within equity.  There is no subsequent measurement of
the equity component.  At initial recognition,  directly attributable transaction costs are assigned to the equity and
liability component pro rata on the basis of the respective carrying amounts. 

Other provisions and accrued liabilities 
20

13

202

Other provisions are recognised where a present obligation (legal or constructive) to third parties has been
incurred as a result of a past event which can be estimated reliably and is likely to lead to an outflow of resourcesand where the timing or amount is uncertain.  Other non-current provisions are discounted if the effect of
discounting is material. 
Accrued liabilities are liabilities to pay for goods or services that have been received or supplied but have not
been paid,  invoiced or formally agreed with the supplier,  including amounts due to employees.  Here,  however,  the
timing and amount of an outflow of resources is not uncertain. 

Pensions and similar obligations
Provisions and expenses for pensions and similar obligations relate to the Group's obligations for defined benefit
and defined contribution plans.  The obligations under defined benefit plans are determined separately for each
plan by valuing the employee benefits accrued in return for their service during the current and prior periods. 
These benefit accruals are discounted to calculate their present value,  and the fair value of any plan assets is
deducted in order to determine the net liability.  The discount rate is set on the basis of yields of high-quality
corporate bonds at the balance sheet date provided there is a deep market for high-quality corporate bonds
in a given currency.  Otherwise,  government bond yields are used as a reference.  Calculations are performed
by qualified actuaries using the 'projected unit credit method" in accordance with IAS 19 'Employee Benefits". 
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement
as incurred.

Consolidated Financial Statements

/

Recognition of revenues
Sales are recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable,  net of returns,  trade discounts
and volume rebates,  when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods are transferred to the
buyer,  and when it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group. 
Royalty and commission income is recognised based on the contract terms on an accrual basis. 

Advertising and promotional expenditures
Production costs for media campaigns are included in prepaid expenses (other current and non-current assets)
until the services are received,  and upon receipt expensed in full.  Significant media buying costs are expensed
over the intended duration of the broadcast. 
Promotional expenses that involve payments,  including one-time up-front payments for promotional
contracts,  are expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the agreement. 

Interest
Interest is recognised as income or expense as incurred using the 'effective interest method" with the exception
of interest that is directly attributable to the acquisition,  construction or production of a qualifying asset.  This
interest is capitalised as part of the cost of the qualifying asset. 

Income taxes 
13

203
20

Current income taxes are computed in accordance with the applicable taxation rules established in the countries
in which the Group operates. 
The Group computes deferred taxes for all temporary differences between the carrying amount and the tax
base of its assets and liabilities and tax loss carry-forwards.  As it is not permitted to recognise a deferred tax
liability for goodwill,  the Group does not compute any deferred taxes thereon. 
Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences and tax loss carry-forwards which exceed
taxable temporary differences are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that the company concerned will
generate sufficient taxable income to realise the associated benefit. 
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised
directly in equity,  in which case it is recognised in equity. 

Estimation uncertainties and judgements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of assumptions and estimates
that affect reported amounts and related disclosures.  Although such estimates are based on Management's best
knowledge of current events and actions,  actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates. 
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance
sheet date which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities within the next financial year are outlined in the respective Notes,  in particular goodwill  /   NOTE 12SEE

Acquisition/disposal of
subsidiaries as well as

­ ssets and liabilities 
Effective March 30,  2012,  adidas AG acquired the remaining 10% share in its German subsidiary GEV
Grundstücksgesellschaft Herzogenaurach mbH & Co.  KG,  which was formerly reported as a non-controlling
interest in other liabilities in compliance with IAS 32 'Financial Instruments: Presentation"  /   NOTE 26.  The
SEE
purchase price of € 7 million was paid at the beginning of April 2012. 
Effective June 1,  2012,  Taylor Made Golf Co.,  Inc.  completed the acquisition of Adams Golf,  Inc.  ('Adams Golf"). 
Based in Plano,  Texas (USA),  Adams Golf designs,  assembles and distributes golf clubs.  With this acquisition,  the
adidas Group intends to further improve its market position within the golf industry.  The entire business of Adams
Golf was purchased for a purchase price of US $ 89 million in cash.

The following valuation methods for the acquired assets were applied:
/ Inventories: For finished goods,  the 'comparative sales method" was used,  which estimates the expected
sales price of the respective inventory,  reduced for all costs expected to be incurred and a profit on those costs. 
The value of the component parts was determined by estimating the cost to replace each component. 
/  Trademarks and other intangible assets: The 'relief-from-royalty method" was applied for the trademarks/
trade names as well as for patents and technology.  The fair value was determined by discounting notional royalty
savings after tax and adding a tax amortisation benefit,  resulting from the amortisation of the acquired asset.  For
the valuation of customer contracts and related customer relationships,  the 'distributor method" was used under
the 'income approach". 
The excess of the acquisition cost paid versus the net of the amounts of the fair values assigned to all
assets acquired and liabilities assumed,  taking into consideration the respective deferred taxes,  was recognised
as goodwill.  It mainly arises from expected synergies and the resulting expansion of the product portfolio of
TaylorMade-adidas Golf.  Any acquired asset that did not meet the identification and recognition criteria for an
asset was included in the amount recognised as goodwill. 
The goodwill arising on this acquisition was allocated to the cash-generating unit TaylorMade-adidas Golf at
the time of the acquisition.  The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes and is denominated in US dollars as
the local functional currency  /   NOTE 02. 
SEE
The acquired subsidiary generated net sales of € 33 million as well as net losses of € 22 million for the period
from June to December 2012.  If this acquisition had occurred on January 1,  2012,  total Group net sales would
have been € 149 billion and net income attributable to shareholders would have been € 534 million for the year
ending December 31,  2012.

years ending December 31,  2013 and 2012,  respectively. 
The Group determines whether goodwill impairment is necessary at least on an annual basis.  This requires an
estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill is allocated.  Estimating the value
in use requires the Group to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the cash-generating units
and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. 
Goodwill impairment losses for 2013 amounted to € 52 million (2012: € 265 million).  The goodwill impairment
amount related to 2013 comprises an impairment loss within the Wholesale segment of € 23 million (2012:
€ 173 million) and an impairment loss within the Retail segment of € 29 million.  In 2012,  € 92 million was impaired

At December 31,  2013,  trademarks,  mainly related to the acquisition of Reebok International Ltd.  (USA) in 2006
and Ashworth,  Inc.  in 2008,  have indefinite useful lives.  This is due to the expectation of permanent use of the
acquired brand names. 
The reported other trademarks mainly relate to the brand names Ashworth,  Adams Golf and Five Ten. 
The Group tests at least on an annual basis whether trademarks with indefinite useful lives are impaired. 
This requires an estimation of the fair value less costs to sell of the trademarks.  As part of this estimationthe Group is required to make an estimate of the expected future trademark-specific sales and appropriate
arm's length notional royalty rates from the cash-generating unit and also to choose a suitable discount rate in
order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.  There was no need for impairment for the years ending
December 31,  2013 and 2012. 
Future changes in expected cash flows and discount rates may lead to impairments of the accounted
trademarks in the future. 
As part of the goodwill impairment test,  the Reebok trademark is allocated on a pro-rata basis to the
cash-generating units (or groups of units).  Thereof,  the major shares relate to Retail CIS (€ 256 million),  Retail
North America (€ 196 million),  Wholesale North America (€ 147 million),  Wholesale Latin America (€ 98 million)
and Wholesale Central Europe (€ 45 million). 
Amortisation expenses for intangible assets with definite useful lives were € 52 million and € 49 million for

Borrowings and
credit lines 
Borrowings are denominated in a variety of currencies in which the Group conducts its business.  The largest
portions of effective gross borrowings (before liquidity swaps for cash management purposes) as at December 312013 are denominated in euros (2013: 76%; 2012: 68%) and US dollars (2013: 14%; 2012: 29%). 
The weighted average interest rate on the Group's gross borrowings decreased to 38% in 2013 (2012: 44%). 
As at December 31,  2013,  the Group had cash credit lines and other long-term financing arrangements totalling
€ 34 billion (2012: € 38 billion); thereof unused credit lines accounted for € 20 billion (2012: € 23 billion).  In
addition,  at December 31,  2013,  the Group had separate lines for the issuance of letters of credit and guarantees
in an amount of approximately € 02 billion (2012: € 02 billion).

The Group's outstanding financings are unsecured and may include standard financial covenants,  which are
reviewed on a quarterly basis.  These covenants may include limits on the disposal of fixed assets,  the maximum
amount of debt secured by liens,  cross default provisions and change of control.  In addition,  certain financial
arrangements contain equity ratio covenants,  minimum equity covenants as well as net loss covenants. 
As at December 31,  2013,  and December 31,  2012,  shareholders' equity was well above the amount of the
minimum equity covenant.  Likewise,  the relevant amount of net income clearly exceeded net loss covenants. 
The amounts disclosed as gross borrowings represent outstanding borrowings under the following
arrangements with aggregated expiration dates as follows:

The above table includes a Eurobond issued on July 6,  2009 in a nominal amount of € 500 million and with a
maturity of five years.  The Eurobond with an annual coupon of 475% was issued in denominations of € 1000
each and was priced with a spread of 200 basis points above the respective euro mid-swap.  The issue was fixed
at 99865%. 
In addition,  gross borrowings include a convertible bond for an aggregate nominal amount of € 500 million
divided into denominations of € 200000 which was issued on March 21,  2012.  The bond has a maximum maturity
(including prolongation options) until June 14,  2019.  The coupon of the bond amounts to 025% and is payable
annually,  commencing on June 14,  2013.  The bond is,  at the option of the respective holder,  convertible at any
time from and including May 21,  2012,  up to and including June 5,  2019,  into up to 602 million new or existing
adidas AG shares.  The convertible bond has a conversion premium of 40% above the reference price of € 5961which resulted in an initial conversion price of € 8346 per share.  As a consequence of contractual provisions
relating to dividend protection,  the conversion price was adjusted to € 8310 per share.  This adjustment became
effective on May 9,  2013.  On June 14,  2017,  the bondholders have the right to call the bond at nominal value plus
interest accrued on the nominal amount.  adidas AG is entitled to redeem the remaining bonds in whole if,  at any
time,  the aggregate principal amount of bonds outstanding falls below 15% of the aggregate principal amount of
the bonds that were initially issued.  Furthermore,  as of July 14,  2017,  adidas AG is entitled to redeem the bonds in
whole if on 20 of 30 consecutive trading days,  the share price of adidas AG exceeds the current conversion price
of € 8310 by at least 30%. 
According to IAS 32 'Financial Instruments: Presentation",  the conversion right represented in the convertible
bond constitutes a financial instrument which is covered in the capital reserve in an amount of € 55 million after
deduction of the issuance cost.  The initial liability component amounted to € 441 million after deduction of the
issuance cost and is shown within long-term borrowings.  The initial difference of € 59 million compared to the
nominal amount of € 500 million is accrued as interest expense of the financial liability over the expected maturity
of the convertible bond using the 'effective interest method".  As at December 31,  2013,  the financial liability
amounted to € 460 million.

The reversal of sundry provisions in 2013 is mainly related to the completion of customs audits and a risk
reassessment.

adidas Group   /  2013 Annual Report 
Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes   /  Notes to the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position

/

The Group has recognised post-employment benefit obligations arising from defined benefit plans.  The benefits
are provided pursuant to the legal,  fiscal and economic conditions in each respective country and mainly depend
on the employees' years of service and remuneration. 
The adidas Group is applying the revised standard IAS 19 Employee Benefits Revised (2011),  IAS 19R,  as of
the beginning of the 2013 financial year.  IAS 19R is retrospectively effective for annual periods beginning on or
after January 1,  2013.  Changes due to IAS 19R which are relevant for the adidas Group are as follows: According
to the net interest approach,  the net interest result to be reported within profit or loss of the period is determined
by multiplying the net pension liability with the discount rate which is used to measure the gross defined benefit
obligation.  As the net pension liability is reduced by any plan assets,  this calculation implicitly assumes a rate of
return on plan assets in the amount of the discount rate.  In addition,  the changes of IAS 19R comprise the effect
of the immediate recognition of unvested past service costs in the statement of income as incurred instead of
amortising them over the vesting period.  The Group has analysed the effects of the above-mentioned changes of
IAS 19R on the current as well as prior consolidated financial statements and has come to the conclusion that
these changes do not have any material effect on the Group's consolidated financial statements.  Therefore,  no
reclassification between other reserves and retained earnings within equity was carried out. 
Under IAS 19R,  early retirement schemes are no longer classified as termination benefits but as other
long-term employee benefits.  Due to this reclassification,  the valuation method has changed.  The impact on the
obligations arising from early retirement schemes as a result of this change is not material in the Group's view.

Defined contribution pension plans
The total expense for defined contribution plans amounted to € 47 million in 2013 (2012: € 46 million). 

Defined benefit pension plans
Given the diverse Group structure,  different defined benefit pension plans exist,  comprising a variety of
post-employment benefit arrangements.  The Group's major defined benefit pension plans relate to adidas AG
and its subsidiaries in the UK and Japan.  The defined benefit pension plans generally provide payments in case
of death,  disability or retirement to former employees and their survivors.  The obligations arising from defined
benefit pension plans are partly covered by plan assets. 
In Germany,  the Group grants its employees contribution-based and final salary defined benefit pension
schemes,  which provide employees with entitlements in the event of retirement,  disability and death.  In
general,  German pension plans operate under the legal framework of the German Company Pension Act
('Betriebsrentengesetz") and under the German Labour Act.  A large proportion of the pension plans are closed
to new entrants.  New employees are entitled to benefits in accordance with the adidas Pension Plan or the adidas
Management Pension Plan.  Both pension plans are so-called matching contribution plans; the contributions to
these pension plans are partly paid by the employee and partly paid by the employer.  The pension plans in Germany
are financed using book reserves,  a pension fund ('Pensionsfonds") or a provident fund ('Unterstützungskasse"). 
The benefits granted to members of the Executive Board are funded via a pension fund ('Pensionsfonds") or
 provident fund ('Unterstützungskasse").  An insurance company is responsible for the determination and the
implementation of the investment strategy.  Further details about the pension entitlements of members of the
Executive Board of adidas AG are contained in the Compensation Report  /   COMPENSATION REPORT,  P.  53. 
SEE
The final salary defined benefit pension scheme in the UK is closed to new entrants and to future accrual. 
The scheme operates under UK trust law and under the jurisdiction of the UK Pensions Regulator.  The pension
scheme is subject to a minimum funding requirement.  The Trustee Board is responsible for setting the scheme's
funding objective,  agreeing the contributions with the company and determining the investment strategy of the
scheme.

In Japan,  employees are entitled to benefits from a defined benefit plan that is not funded by plan assets.  The
benefits in case of retirement are dependent on final salary and service,  and are paid out as a lump sum.  The
pension plan is subject to Japanese labour law.

The Group's pension plans are subject to risks from changes in actuarial assumptions,  such as the discount ratesalary and pension increase rates,  and risks from changes in longevity.  A lower discount rate results in a higher
defined benefit obligation and/or in higher contributions to the pension funds.  Lower than expected performance
of the plan assets could lead to an increase in required contributions or to a decline of the funded status.

Net defined benefit liability 
—

The determination of assets and liabilities for defined benefit plans is based upon statistical and actuarial
valuations.  In particular,  the present value of the defined benefit obligation is driven by financial variables (such
as the discount rates or future increases in salaries) and demographic variables (such as mortality and employee
turnover).  The actuarial assumptions may differ significantly from the actual circumstances and could lead to
different cash flows.

Consolidated Financial Statements

/ 048 
/

The actuarial assumptions for withdrawal and mortality rates are based on statistical information available in the
various countries.  In Germany,  the Heubeck 2005 G mortality tables are used.  In the UK,  assumptions are based
on the S1NA base table with modified improvement of the life expectancy mortality tables.  In Japan,  the "21st Life
Tables revised in 2010" mortality tables are used. 
As in the previous year,  the calculation of the pension liabilities in Germany is based on a discount rate
determined using the Mercer Yield Curve (MYC) approach. 
Remeasurements,  such as gains or losses arising from changes in the actuarial assumptions for defined
benefit pension plans during the financial year or a return on the plan assets exceeding the interest income,  are
immediately recognised outside the income statement in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
The remeasurements recognised in 2013 in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income result in an
increase in other reserves of € 6 million (2012: reduction of € 35 million).

Since many pension plans are closed to future accrual,  the salary trend plays a minor role in determining pension
obligations.  Due to the fact that the benefits of the German pension plans are mainly paid as lump sums or
instalment payments,  the pension increase rate and the mortality assumption have significantly less impact than
the discount rate when calculating the pension obligations.

Approximately 83% (2012: 85%) of the total plan assets are allocated to plan assets in the UK (2013: 44%,  2012:
45%),  Germany (2013: 30%,  2012: 31%) and Switzerland (2013: 9%,  2012: 9%). 
In the UK,  the plan assets are held under trust within the pension fund.  In Germany,  the plan assets are
invested in insurance contracts and in a pension fund.  The plan assets in Switzerland are held by a pension
foundation.  The investment strategy is aligned with the structure of the pension obligations in these countries.  In
the rest of the world,  the plan assets consist predominantly of insurance contracts. 
The expected payments for 2014 amount to € 11 million.  Thereof,  € 7 million relate to benefits directly paid to
pensioners by the Group companies and € 4 million to employer contributions paid into the plan assets.  In 2013the actual return on plan assets was € 6 million (2012: € 7 million).

All equities and bonds are traded freely and have a quoted market price in an active market.  The other assets
consist predominantly of foreign insurance products. 
At each balance sheet date,  the company analyses the over- or underfunding and,  where appropriate,  adjusts
the composition of plan assets. 
In the next financial year,  the adidas Group intends to transfer assets to a trustee via a Contractual Trust
Arrangement (CTA) for the purpose of fiduciary management and insolvency insurance with regard to part of
the pension obligations of adidas AG.  In this respect,  the registered association 'adidas Pension Trust e. V. " was

exclude subscription rights pursuant to the previous sentence may,  however,  only be used to the extent that the
pro-rata amount of the new shares in the nominal capital together with the pro-rata amount in the nominal capital

company as well as on the underlying resolutions of the Annual General Meeting held on May 6,  2010.  Additional
contingent capital does not exist. 
At the balance sheet date,  the nominal capital is conditionally increased by up to € 36 million divided into
no more than 36000000 registered shares (Contingent Capital 2010).  The contingent capital increase will be

authorisation of the Executive Board granted by the resolution adopted by the Annual General Meeting of May 62010,  up to May 5,  2015 and guaranteed by the company,  exercise their option or conversion rights or,  if they are
obliged to exercise the option or conversion duties,  meet their obligations to exercise the warrant or convert the
bond,  or to the extent that the company exercises its rights to choose to deliver shares in the company for the
total amount or partially instead of a payment and insofar as no cash settlement,  treasury shares or shares of
another public-listed company are used to serve these rights.  The new shares shall be issued at the respective
option or conversion price to be established in accordance with the aforementioned authorisation resolution. 
The new shares shall carry dividend rights from the commencement of the financial year in which the shares
are issued.  The Executive Board is authorised,  subject to Supervisory Board approval,  to stipulate any additional
details concerning the implementation of the contingent capital increase.

Capital management
The Group's policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to uphold investor,  creditor and market confidence
and to sustain future development of the business. 
The Group seeks to maintain a balance between a higher return on equity that might be possible with higher
levels of borrowings and the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position.  The Group further aims
to maintain net debt below two times EBITDA over the long term. 
Financial leverage is defined as the ratio between net borrowings (short- and long-term borrowings less
cash and cash equivalents as well as short-term financial assets) in an amount of negative € 295 million (2012:
negative € 448 million) and shareholders' equity in an amount of € 5489 billion (2012: € 5304 billion).  EBITDA
amounted to € 1523 billion for the financial year ending December 31,  2013 (2012: € 1445 billion).  The ratio
between net borrowings and EBITDA amounted to negative 02 for the financial year ending December 31,  2013
(2012: negative 03).

/  Hedging reserve: comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow

from the acquisition of non-controlling interests. 
/  Retained earnings: comprise the accumulated profits less dividends paid.

amount: € 282 million).  The Executive Board of adidas AG will propose to shareholders a dividend payment of

subsequent remaining amount will be carried forward.

1)  his category relates to a 91% investment in FC Bayern München AG of € 80 million.  Dividends

are distributed by FC Bayern München AG instead of regular interest payments. 

Level 1 is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
Level 2 is based on inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,  either directly (i, e.  as prices) or indirectly (i, e.  derived from prices). 
Level 3 is based on inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

Due to the short-term maturities of cash and cash equivalents,  short-term financial assets,  accounts receivable
and payable as well as other current financial receivables and payables,  their respective fair values approximate
their carrying amount. 
The fair values of non-current financial assets and liabilities are estimated by discounting expected future
cash flows using current interest rates for debt of similar terms and remaining maturities and adjusted by an
adidas Group specific credit risk premium. 
Fair values of long-term financial assets classified as available-for-sale are based on quoted market prices in
an active market or are calculated as present values of expected future cash flows. 
The fair values of forward contracts and currency options are determined on the basis of market conditions
at the balance sheet date.  The fair value of a currency option is determined using generally accepted models to
calculate option prices.  The fair market value of an option is influenced not only by the remaining term of the
option,  but also by other determining factors such as the actual foreign exchange rate and the volatility of the
underlying foreign currency base. 
In accordance with IFRS 13,  the following tables show the valuation methods used in measuring Level 1Level 2 and Level 3 fair values,  as well as the significant unobservable inputs used.

Financial instruments for the hedging of foreign exchange risk
The adidas Group uses natural hedges and arranges forward contracts,  currency options and currency swaps to
protect against foreign exchange risk.  As at December 31,  2013,  the Group had outstanding currency options with
premiums paid totalling an amount of € 2 million (2012: € 4 million).  The effective part of the currency hedges is
directly recognised in hedging reserves and as part of the acquisition costs of inventories,  respectively,  and posted
into the income statement at the same time as the underlying secured transaction is recorded.  An amount of
€ 2 million after taxes (2012: € 4 million) for currency options and an amount of negative € 34 million after taxes
(2012: negative € 7 million) for forward contracts were recorded in hedging reserves.  Currency option premiums
impacted net income in the amount of € 4 million in 2013 (2012: € 4 million). 
The total time value of the currency options not being part of a hedge in an amount of negative € 4 million
(2012: negative € 3 million) was recorded in the income statement in 2013.  In 2012,  due to a change in the exposuresome of the currency hedges were terminated and consequently an amount of € 1 million was reclassified from
hedging reserves to the income statement. 
In the years ending December 31,  2013 and 2012,  hedging instruments related to product sourcing were
bought to hedge a total net amount of US $ 52 billion and US $ 51 billion,  respectively. 
The notional amounts of all outstanding currency hedging instruments,  which are mainly related to cash flow
hedges,  are summarised in the following table:

 total net fair value of negative € 36 million (2012: negative € 10 million) for forward contracts related to hedging
instruments falling under hedge accounting as per definition of IAS 39 'Financial Instruments: Recognition and
Measurement" was recorded in the hedging reserve.  The remaining net fair value of € 4 million (2012: € 9 million)mainly related to liquidity swaps for cash management purposes and to forward contracts hedging intercompany
dividend receivables,  was recorded in the income statement.  The total fair value of negative € 2 million (2012:
positive € 2 million) for outstanding currency options related to cash flow hedges.  This consists of a positive
time value of € 8 million (2012: € 2 million) and of a negative time value of € 12 million (2012: € 5 million) and,  in
contrast to the preceding table,  does not include the intrinsic value of the options. 
The fair value adjustments of outstanding cash flow hedges for forecasted sales are reported in the income
statement when the forecasted sales transactions are recorded.  The vast majority of these transactions are
forecasted to occur in 2014.  At the balance sheet date,  inventories were adjusted by positive € 20 million (2012:
positive € 16 million) which will be recognised in the income statement in 2014. 
In the hedging reserve,  a negative amount of € 6 million (2012: negative € 21 million) is included for hedging
the currency risk of net investments in foreign entities,  mainly for the subsidiaries LLC 'adidas,  Ltd. " and adidas
Sports (China) Co.  Ltd.  This reserve will remain until the investment in the foreign entity has been sold.  As at
December 31,  2013,  no ineffective part of the hedges was recorded in the income statement. 
In order to determine the fair values of its derivatives that are not publicly traded,  the adidas Group uses
generally accepted quantitative financial models based on market conditions prevailing at the balance sheet date. 
In 2013,  the fair values of the derivatives were determined applying mainly the 'par method",  which uses
actively traded forward rates.

Income taxes 
adidas AG and its German subsidiaries are subject to German corporate and trade taxes.  For the years ending
December 31,  2013 and 2012,  the statutory corporate income tax rate of 15% plus a surcharge of 55% thereon is
applied to earnings.  The municipal trade tax is approximately 114% of taxable income. 
For non-German subsidiaries,  deferred taxes are calculated based on tax rates that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the closing date. 

Deferred tax assets and liabilities
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if they relate to the same fiscal authority.  The following deferred tax
assets and liabilities,  determined after appropriate offsetting,  are presented in the consolidated statement of

Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the realisation of the related benefit is probable.  For
the assessment of probability,  in addition to past performance and the respective prospects for the foreseeable
future,  appropriate tax structuring measures are also taken into consideration. 
Deferred tax assets for which the realisation of the related tax benefits is not probable decreased on a
currency-neutral basis from € 508 million to € 435 million for the year ending December 31,  2013.  These amounts
mainly relate to tax losses carried forward and unused foreign tax credits of the US tax group,  which begin to
expire in 2026.  The remaining unrecognised deferred tax assets relate to subsidiaries operating in markets where
the realisation of the related tax benefit is not considered probable. 
The Group does not recognise deferred tax liabilities for unremitted earnings of non-German subsidiaries
to the extent that they are expected to be permanently invested in international operations.  These earnings,  the
amount of which cannot be practicably computed,  could become subject to additional tax if they were remitted as
dividends or if the Group were to sell its shareholdings in the subsidiaries.

Segmental information

232

The Group operates predominantly in one industry segment the design,  distribution and marketing of athletic
and sports lifestyle products. 
Following the Group's internal management reporting and in accordance with the definition of IFRS 8
'Operating Segments",  six operating segments have been identified: Wholesale,  Retail,  TaylorMade-adidas GolfRockport,  Reebok-CCM Hockey and Other Centrally Managed Brands.  According to the criteria of IFRS 8 for
reportable segments,  the business segments Wholesale and Retail are reported separately,  while the remaining
are aggregated under Other Businesses due to their only subordinate materiality. 
The Wholesale segment comprises all business activities relating to the distribution of adidas and Reebok
products to retail customers. 
The Retail segment comprises all business activities relating to the sale of adidas and Reebok products
directly to end consumers through own retail and own e-commerce platforms. 
The operating segment TaylorMade-adidas Golf comprises the brands TaylorMade,  adidas Golf,  Adams Golf
and Ashworth. 
The Other Centrally Managed Brands segment primarily includes the business activities of the labels Y-3 and
Porsche Design Sport as well as the business activities of the brand Five Ten in the outdoor action sports sector. 
Furthermore,  the segment also comprises the German own-retail activities of the adidas NEO label. 
Certain centralised Group functions do not meet the definition of IFRS 8 for a reportable operating segment. 
This includes functions such as central treasury,  global sourcing as well as other headquarter departments. 
Assets,  liabilities,  income and expenses relating to these corporate functions are presented together with other
non-allocable items and intersegment eliminations in the reconciliations. 
The chief operating decision maker for the adidas Group has been defined as the joint Executive Board of
adidas AG. 
There are no intersegment sales between the reportable segments.  Accounting and valuation policies applied
for reporting segmental information are the same as those used for the adidas Group  /   NOTE 02. 
SEE
The results of the operating segments are reported in the line item "Segmental operating profit".  This is
defined as gross profit minus costs directly attributable to the segment or the group of segments (primarily sales
and logistics costs) before marketing working budget expenditures and operating overhead costs not directly
attributable. 
Segmental assets include accounts receivable as well as inventories.  Only these items are reported to the
chief operating decision maker on a regular basis.  Depreciation,  amortisation,  impairment losses (except for
goodwill) and reversals of impairment losses as well as capital expenditures for tangible and intangible assets
are part of the segmental reporting,  even though segmental assets do not contain tangible and intangible assets.
