Dear Shareholders
2004 was an outstanding year for adidas-Salomon.  As our teams,  athletes
and products took center stage at some of the most exciting events in
sports including the European Football Championships and the Summer
Olympics our Group delivered impressive sales growth as well as a record
margin and earnings. 
All of our geographic markets contributed to this achievement.  In North
America,  where success is a key part of our global ambitions,  we increased
sales with incremental improvements every quarter,  signaling that our
turnaround is in full swing.  We grew at strong double-digit rates in Asia
and Latin America and delivered further profitability gains in our biggest
market,  Europe.  All our brands contributed to this success.  As a result,  I
believe that we are stronger and more competitive than we have ever been
before.  And most importantly,  despite tougher market conditions in 2005our Group is well positioned to deliver another year of outstanding performance. 
Let's review some of the highlights of 2004.  We further intensified our
focus on product innovation and technology.  Two standouts in this category
were the adidas1 running shoe and TaylorMade's r7® quad driver.  Both
of these products are revolutionary.  The adidas1 is the first intelligent
running shoe able to optimize cushioning levels while running,  thanks to 
The Group

an integrated microprocessor.  Although the product is only just coming to
the market this month,  it has already made headlines around the world
and it has been chosen as an Innovation of the Year by Popular ScienceTime and other leading publications.  The TaylorMade r7® quad driver is
the first metalwood that allows players to adjust weight distribution in the
head of the club to enhance player-specific swing characteristics.  Only
weeks after its launch,  the r7® became the number one driver on the US
and European PGA Tours.  And we were able to dramatically increase our
leading market position in golf's largest and most profitable product
category. 
Truly revolutionary as well was the change in 2004 in our advertising
and corporate communications approach,  where I had felt we need to leadnot follow.  And lead we did with our first-ever global brand advertising
campaign: 'Impossible Is Nothing".  This campaign,  which features past and
present athletes from various sports and regions,  starting with Muhammad
Ali,  highlights our belief that sport,  life and our adidas brand are all about
the continuous desire to push further,  to surpass limits and to break new
ground.  It really captures what our brands and Group represent.  If you
thought so,  too,  you are not alone.  The campaign has received tremendous
positive consumer feedback and 99 prestigious advertising awards so far. 
In 2005,  we are going to widen and broaden this campaign even further. 
Keeping our brands and products cool and connected to leading sports
and style icons will be essential in the coming years.  With David Beckhamarguably the world's most popular athlete,  we announced a new line of
on- and off-pitch products,  which will help us grow in the fast-expanding
football lifestyle category.  We also formalized our long-standing relationship with hip hop queen Missy Elliott,  whose striking footwear and apparel
products have hit the market in limited distribution.  And let's not forget
star designer Stella McCartney,  who has developed the first true perfor
18

mance design collection for women.  Other exciting adidas collaborations
include our strong-selling basketball products,  the T-MAC and the Garnettwhich unite innovative adidas technologies with the top two players in
basketball NBA top scorer Tracy McGrady and Most Valuable Player Kevin
Garnett.  In 2005,  we will further commercialize these relationships. 
2004's biggest sporting events the European Football Championships
and the Summer Olympics were prime showcases for adidas-Salomon
products and athletes.  At the European Football Championships,  the adidas
sponsored Greek national football team,  which had never won a match
in a major tournament,  emerged triumphant,  demonstrating that truly
nothing is impossible when it comes to world-class football.  Their victory
further strengthened adidas' position as the clear number one in football. 
At the Olympics,  we lived up to our tradition as the authentic performance
sports group by not only sponsoring the event but also outfitting almost
half of all the athletes,  including stars of the Games such as Justine HeninHardenne,  Ian Thorpe,  Roman Sebrle and Elena Isinbayeva. 
There are many more successes in 2004 that I could highlight here.  But
what is most important to note is that they did not come about by chance. 
The achievements at adidas,  Salomon and TaylorMade-adidas Golf in 2004
are a result of years of intensive efforts focused on gaining visibility and
momentum. 
And similar dedication paid off in our excellent financial performance. 
We grew our top line by 7% on a currency-neutral basis,  with improvements
coming from all brands and regions.  We delivered a record gross margin. 
And while this was certainly helped by favorable currency movementsreduced clearance sales,  our improving product mix and accelerating ownretail activities were also important to this improvement.  In 2004,  we
increased our operating expenses to optimize our presence at the year's
two major sporting events but also to accelerate growth in North America 
The Group
----------------------Letter to the Shareholders

and Asia,  as well as to restructure our ski production activities within
Salomon.  Nevertheless,  we were still able to expand our operating margin
to 90%,  and we increased our net income by 21% to € 314 million,  which
is our highest level ever and more than twice the rate we expected at the
beginning of the year. 
We also continued to make significant progress on improving the Group's
financial health.  As a result of our strong operational performance and
our continued tight working capital management,  we reduced our debt by
nearly 40% to € 594 million and now have surpassed our financial leverage
target of between 45 and 50%. 
We've clearly created significant value and intend to make sure that
our shareholders participate in this success.  First,  we plan to substantially
increase our dividend this year.  In May,  we will propose a 30% dividend
increase to shareholders as well as a long-term change to our payout ratioextending the defined range from 15 to 20% of net earnings to between
15 and 25% going forward.  We are also initiating a share buyback programin which we plan to repurchase up to 10% of our shares.  We appreciate
the support we have had for our strategy and decisions over the last several
years and understand our responsibilities to shareholders now and going
forward.  While share price appreciation will continue to be our most
direct vehicle for delivering shareholder value (in 2004 we were again
among the top three performers in the DAX-30),  we believe dividends and
share buybacks are important tools to further increase returns to youthe owners of our Group. 
As I mentioned at the beginning of this letter,  2005 is set to be another
exciting year for adidas-Salomon.  The gains we made in 2004 give us powerful competitive momentum and we have no intention of slowing down. 

20

The challenges are clear: ensuring the adidas turnaround in America
continues to accelerate,  extending our market leadership in Europe in a
tightening retail environment and restructuring Salomon to improve its
profitability.  And we will continue to position the adidas-Salomon Group
for sustainable growth.  Already this year we have announced our sponsorship of the Beijing Olympics in 2008.  In addition,  we have taken England's
top-ranked football team,  Chelsea,  under contract and expanded our leading role at all Football World Cups by extending our partnership with FIFA
until 2014.  And the year has just begun. 
Design and technological innovation will underscore our leadership
position again in 2005.  In the second half of the year,  for example,  you can
expect to see the first exciting products for the 2006 World Cup in Germanyincluding the Official Match Ball. 
Before I close,  I would like to take the opportunity to thank all of the
adidas-Salomon employees for their dedication and commitment over the
last year.  I am more than confident that we have the right people to take
our Group to the next level. 
So,  with record performance,  focused strategy and exciting products
in the pipeline,  all the pieces are in place for adidas-Salomon.  Our ambitions continue to grow as our position strengthens.  Clearly 'Impossible Is
Nothing" in 2005 and beyond!
Yours sincerely
Herbert Hainer
Chairman,  Chief Executive Officer

Our Strategy
To achieve our goal of leadership in the sporting goods sector,  adidas-Salomon
continually focuses on strengthening and developing our brands.  We aim to
maximize consumer impact and enhance brand profitability through the application
of five strategic approaches. 

24

Matching Our Structure to Our Consumers 
Achieving Excellence in Execution 
Anticipating and fulfilling consumer desires and needs is central to building powerful
brands.  The adidas-Salomon organization is structured to ensure that our brand values
are inseparably linked to the particular expectations and aspirations of our consumers. 
This is unique in our industry,  which is traditionally organized along footwear,  apparel
and hardware lines,  and is a competitive advantage for our Group. 

Great products and marketing are vital to success in our industry,  but sales growth
also depends on consistent on-time retail delivery,  ensuring best quality and the ability
to go the extra mile for the customer.  We are particularly focused on shortening and
streamlining our global supply chain,  ensuring best-practice social and environmental
standards and improving our customer service efforts. 

Extending Design and Innovation Leadership 
Focusing on Financial Health 
Consumer buying and brand perception in the sporting goods sector are intrinsically
linked to cutting-edge design coupled with market-leading,  high-profile technologies
that capture consumer imagination.  At adidas-Salomon,  we are committed to keeping
our product pipeline full with new,  exciting designs and technologies.  We plan to launch
at least one major new technology or technological evolution per year.  Our major innovations for 2005 are outlined in the Outlook section of this report. 

Outstanding performance is required of a leader and we know that top- and bottom-line
growth is critical to success.  But we also believe that other performance indicators are
crucial,  in particular operating margin.  We intend to achieve an operating margin of
10% by 2006 and believe we can be among the leaders in the industry in this area over
the next three to five years.  In addition,  tight management of working capital and generating significant free cash flow will continue to be important for us going forward.  At the
same time,  we remain committed to increasing returns to our shareholders,  as reflected
in our new share buyback program and higher dividend. 

Developing Leading Positions in All Our Major Markets
We are in the business to win.  We aim to occupy the number one or number two positions in all the markets and categories in which we compete.  To accelerate our top-line
growth going forward,  we will intensify our activities with key accounts,  step up ownretail initiatives and increase our focus on selected consumer groups (e.g.  women).  On
 regional basis,  our efforts start in Europe,  where we will extend our leadership position with our 'Winning in Europe" program to drive both top- and bottom-line growth
for the coming years.  In North America,  our goal is to significantly increase both market
share and profitability within the next three to five years.  In Asia,  we are striving to
become the market leader with top positions in the region's major markets.  In Latin
America,  we expect to continue to deliver the strong growth seen during 2004.

adidas At adidas,  our organization is matched to the needs of three groups
of sport-oriented consumers: Our Sport Performance division is aimed at meeting
the sport-specific needs of athletes at all performance levels.  Sport Heritage targets
trendsetters seeking sport-inspired streetwear with an authentic origin,  and Sport
Style focuses on young cosmopolitan consumers looking for exclusive,  fashionoriented sportswear products.  This three-divisional approach helps us to develop and
market innovative products,  to best meet the needs of today's diverse consumers. 

adidas Sport Performance: Focusing on Functionality and Innovation
adidas Sport Performance focuses on offering functional and innovative products in all
our sports categories.  Our top five priorities are running,  football,  basketball,  tennis
and training.  We currently hold the number one or number two position globally in each
of these categories.  Exciting new products are introduced within these categories every
season.  In 2005,  our major initiatives will again include further commercialization of
our key technologies,  special attention to the running and basketball categories and the
global advertising campaign titled 'Impossible Is Nothing". 

Impossible Is Nothing: adidas' Attitude Drives Brand Campaign
adidas launched the 'Impossible Is Nothing" brand campaign in 2004 with tremendous
success and we will continue to strengthen this message in 2005.  We will present
'Impossible Is Nothing" in innovative and challenging ways and use it to further inspire
and involve our consumers.  As in 2004,  we will celebrate the power of sport and
demonstrate our confidence that 'Impossible Is Nothing".  The fully integrated communication campaign will feature numerous adidas athletes from various sports who
share our desire to surpass limits and to challenge the impossible. 

New Technologies and Products Support Running's Race for the Number One
Position
Running is the world's largest footwear category and an area where adidas has always
been strong.  We strive to be the leader in design,  innovation,  performance and ultimately
in volume.  In March,  we are bringing a revolutionary product to market: the adidas1. 
It is the first shoe featuring a built-in microprocessor for intelligent cushioning that
automatically and continuously adjusts to the unique needs of individual athletes and
changing surface conditions.  In addition,  we will expand on our successful technologies
with a new version of the Ground Control System™ in the adiStar Control as well as
new products featuring our successful ClimaCool® and a3® technologies.  Additionallywe will attack the technical running market by further developing our three,  strongly
established running families.  The adiStar family consists of premium performance
products,  built with our newest technologies.  The Supernova line includes highperformance products constructed using our most viable technologies.  Finally,  our
Response family features performance products with our most commercial technologies. 
We will support these innovations and the rest of our strong offering in running with
high-impact marketing and communication around the world.  We will create excitement
amongst runners at all levels by providing the most innovative products. 

28

Focus on adidas Strength in Football 
adidas Sport Heritage: Increasing Focus in North America 
The UEFA EURO 2004™ European Football Championships in Portugal reconfirmed our
leadership in football.  Our sponsorship of such teams as the Greek national team,  which
won the European Championships,  as well as Bayern Munich,  Real Madrid,  AC Milan
and Ajax Amsterdam,  or players such as David Beckham and Zinédine Zidane,  highlights
our unique skill in selecting key partners.  In 2005,  we will further build on the global
football and lifestyle icon David Beckham with exclusive performance products and a
totally new lifestyle apparel range.  In addition,  we will make our mark in the football
lifestyle market with a new footwear and apparel range featuring silhouettes of on-field
performance products as well as newly designed football-inspired products.  At the
same time we are already actively preparing to celebrate the 2006 FIFA World Cup™ in
Germany.  As Official Sponsor,  Supplier and Licensee of this event,  and with numerous
product and marketing initiatives,  we will ensure our continued domination in the world's
football marketplace. 

The adidas Sport Heritage division targets sports lifestyle consumers who seek trendsetting streetwear with authentic origins.  The goal is to be the brand of choice in the
global sports lifestyle market.  This division,  started in 2000,  is now one of the key trendsetting brands in the market for the sports lifestyle consumer.  Selective distribution to
prevent dilution of the brand plays a major role in the development of this division.  An
aggressive own-retail strategy will also help us commercialize our success.  In 2005,  we
will pursue our attack on the lifestyle market and further sharpen our market segmentation with exciting new concepts to directly address today's lifestyle consumer.  Additionally,  we will expand our fashion distribution as well as increase our focus in the
North American market.  We expect this division to comprise 25 to 30% of total adidas
sales in the mid term. 

Basketball: The Triple Threat
Basketball is a rapidly growing category in the USA and is key to our future growth
prospects in this region.  For the 2004/2005 season we have three of the best and most
inspirational NBA players: Tracy McGrady,  Kevin Garnett and Tim Duncan.  In additionwe have signed Dwight Howard,  No.  1 NBA draft pick in 2004,  New York high school
wonder Sebastian Telfair,  two additional first round picks as well as the 2004 NBA Finals
Most Valuable Player Chauncey Billups.  Since we are committed to constant innovation
for our superstars,  we will launch new signature products for each of our top three
players in 2005.  The T-MAC 5,  worn by Tracy McGrady,  will be launched in November
2005.  Tim Duncan will wear the D-Cool,  featuring our ClimaCool® technology,  and Kevin
Garnett's second signature shoe,  the KG 2,  was launched in February of this year.  In
2005,  adidas will have the most complete basketball product offering ever and will deliver
substantial growth in this category. 

adidas Sport Style: Expanding the Power of the Brand
The adidas Sport Style division is entering its third year in 2005.  Our Y-3 collectiondeveloped with designer Yohji Yamamoto,  is helping us extend our product appeal to
the cosmopolitan consumers who are looking for exclusive,  style-leading active sportswear products.  Yamamoto's strong presence in this area allows us to expand the power
of the adidas brand.  The collection is limited to fashion-oriented accounts in EuropeNorth America and Asia.  Influential designs combined with the highest quality standards
clearly distinguish Y-3 from any other product in the market.

Salomon At Salomon,  our origins are in winter sports.  We are the world's
market leader in terms of sales and product innovation.  To be better seasonally
balanced,  we have extended our activities beyond winter sports over the past few
years,  taking leading positions in cycling,  outdoor footwear and inline skating
products.  More recently,  we have expanded our portfolio of activities to include skateboarding and surfing.  We believe that consumers are keen to discover new sensations and new playgrounds and that every athlete wants to achieve top performance. 
We also believe that all consumers deserve the very best in reliability,  comfort and
convenience so that they only need to focus on one thing: enjoying sports. 

Salomon: Accelerating Growth in Soft Goods
Salomon is committed to delivering high-performance hardware,  with many innovations coming to market in 2005.  These include innovations in all our major winter
categories (see Group Management Report/Outlook).  However,  the most important
component of our future growth will also involve expanding our product offering in the
Salomon soft goods categories.  In 2005,  we will introduce our 'Women Will" collection
targeted specifically at women between the ages of 20 and 35 who enjoy freedom action
sports.  The collection will feature unique styling and characteristics in both footwear
and apparel and will also be strongly linked to our women-specific equipment ranges. 

Mavic-adidas Cycling: Capturing Synergies in the Bike Business
Mavic sets the standard as the leading brand for high-end rims and wheels for mountain
and road racing bikes.  adidas cycling products were brought into this product unit in
2003,  allowing our Group to strategically position itself as an integrated supplier of both
cycling hardware and soft goods.  We are expecting to accelerate the growth of this unit
in 2005 both through innovative wheels coming to the market as well as new footwear
and apparel ranges. 

Bonfire: The Ultimate in Snowboard Apparel
Bonfire focuses on creating highly technical apparel for snowboarding.  It is famous for
its extremely waterproof and highly breathable garments,  with features specifically
designed for snowboarding.  In 2005,  we will introduce new technical innovations and
further expand our women's range. 

Arc'Teryx: The Reference Brand in Technical Outdoor Apparel
Arc'Teryx is the reference brand in North America's outdoor technical apparel market
with a strong track record of product innovation,  including technical outerwear,  harnesses,  layering systems and performance backpacks.  Looking ahead,  we will extend
Arc'Teryx's success by continuously developing unique and innovative apparel products
for the most demanding outdoor sports enthusiasts. 

Cliché: Setting Trends in Skateboarding
Cliché is a leading European skateboard company with strong growth rates over the
last several years.  In 2005,  our priority will be to further strengthen our international
distribution network to ensure continued growth in this category.

TaylorMade-adidas Golf For more than 25 years
TaylorMade has continually broken performance barriers with innovative metalwoods such as the Tour Burner™,  Burner® Bubble®,  300 Series®,  R500 Series™ and
now the r7® quad.  Clubs such as these have firmly cemented TaylorMade's reputation
as the world's leading brand of premium metalwoods.  So has the continued success
of players who choose to use our equipment,  which in 2004 included US Open winner
Retief Goosen,  Open Championship winner Todd Hamilton and Ryder Cup hero Sergio
Garcia.  Yet TaylorMade makes high-performance golf equipment not only for tour
professionals,  but for all golfers who strive to hit the ball farther,  straighter and
better.  TaylorMade-adidas Golf markets all major golf products including ironshybrids,  wedges,  putters,  balls,  footwear and apparel.  Our highest priority is to
create authentic and innovative products that deliver a level of quality and performance that are second to none. 

TaylorMade Capitalizes on Innovations
TaylorMade brought ground-breaking innovation to the market in 2004 with our r7®
quad driver,  which drew extraordinary attention from media,  tour professionals and
recreational players across the globe.  It ranked as the number one driver model on
the US and European PGA Tours and was used to win 14 tournaments,  including the
US Open,  PGA Championship and Tour Championship.  The r7® quad also made a
profound impact among consumers,  and so did the r5™ dual D and r5™ dual N,  two
remarkably forgiving drivers that share technology with the r7® to promote longerstraighter results.  The TaylorMade Rescue® Mid was the most popular hybrid among
both tour professionals and consumers,  and shows no sign of letting up in 2005.  In
irons,  significant improvements in our rac™ iron technology have led to the launch of
new versions of our rac™ OS and rac™ LT models as well as the new rac™ TP Forged
irons.  Additionally,  new innovations in the putter category are also in the pipeline. 

adidas Golf Significantly Grows Apparel Business with Continued Growth Expected
adidas Golf footwear continues to be widely worn on the world's professional golf tours
due to its cutting-edge performance technologies,  and is recognized across the globe
by virtue of our famous three stripes,  which have fast become a trademark in golf for
comfort,  performance and style.  And not just in footwear: adidas Golf has quickly become
well-known among golfers for high-performance golf apparel,  thanks to the intelligent technologies and innovative designs that go into outerwear such as ClimaStorm and
ClimaShell,  as well as apparel such as ClimaCool®.  In fact,  the popularity of ClimaCool®
helped us to significantly grow our apparel business in 2004,  with continued vigorous
growth expected in 2005. 

Maxfli on Course to Strengthen Brand Status
The Maxfli brand continued strongly in 2004 thanks in large part to the Noodle®,  which
remained a powerful player in the popular long-and-soft golf ball category.  Backed by a
creative new marketing program,  the Noodle® should continue its success in 2005 by
carving out additional market share.  Likewise,  Maxfli should receive a significant boost
from multiple new products planned for 2005 including the BlackMAX® golf ball.  The
BlackMAX® was designed with input from tour pros,  and it is another important step in
our efforts to restore the Maxfli brand's status as a premium performance brand.

Global Operations adidas
Strong Initiatives Drive Major Supply Chain
Improvements 
Salomon's Global Operations division is critical for
coordinating the development,  commercialization and
manufacturing of our products,  and it leads our efforts
in supply chain improvement.  The adidas-Salomon
supply chain can be divided into two different cycles:
product creation and procurement.  The product creation
cycle describes our activities from the initial product
concept to product offering and comprises the designdevelopment and commercialization of our products. 
This part of the process is followed by the procurement
cycle,  which includes order management,  manufacturing and distribution.  We remain committed to making
significant permanent improvements in both the creation
and procurement areas to achieve optimal effects in
terms of quality,  costs and delivery performance. 

In 2004,  our focus was on completing the restructuring
of our apparel organization and further rationalizing
of our supply base,  especially in light of apparel quota
removals in 2005.  Going forward,  these efforts are
enabling us to build even more flexible and innovative
supply chain programs to service diverse and dynamic
market demands as well as to take advantage of increasing trade liberalization.  We have also been able to
make significant progress in our ability to develop and
commercialize groundbreaking new product technologies.  In 2004,  we successfully executed special lead
time reduction projects in both footwear and apparel. 
We are now taking many of the learnings on reducing
both development and fulfillment lead times from our
'Apparel Breakthrough" initiative and applying them to
our footwear and hardware processes.  Our goal is to
create a world-class supply chain that is reliable and
flexible.  To do this,  we will make ongoing improvements
in our supply base,  increase both lean management
initiatives and investment in cutting-edge technologies
as well as strengthen our on-site presence and quality
programs. 

Independent Manufacturers Produce adidas-Salomon
Products
The vast majority of adidas-Salomon products are produced by independent manufacturers.  We provide these
suppliers with detailed specifications for the production
and delivery of our products.  In order to ensure the high
quality that consumers expect from our products we
enforce strict quality control and inspection procedures
(see our Social and Environmental Report). 

Ongoing Efforts to Further Refine Supplier Base
The relationship to,  and quality of,  our suppliers has
become an increasingly important factor for both the outcome of our Global Operations activities and the Group's
overall success (see Group Management Report/Risk
Management).  As a result,  it is ever more necessary for
adidas-Salomon to play an active role in refining our
supplier base.  We work closely with our suppliers on key
initiatives such as boosting efficiency,  enhancing management systems,  improving labeling or supporting our
quick response programs in order to better serve our
customers.  Benchmark indicators,  which combine objective data,  such as quality and delivery performancewith more subjective ratings such as customer service
orientation and innovation,  help us to keep suppliers
focused on our key initiatives.  Further,  our structure
facilitates a close relationship with our suppliers.  We
have cross-functional teams who are on site at the
factories on a daily basis and,  in many cases,  are based
at the same location as their factory counterparts. 

Footwear Production Dominated by Asia
In 2004,  Asia continued to be our most important
sourcing region.  Approximately 94% of adidas-Salomon
footwear was produced in this region,  with China and
Vietnam having been the largest sourcing countriesrepresenting approximately 55% and 21% of total footwear production respectively.  Production in Europe was
4%,  whereas the Americas accounted for 2% of our
footwear purchases.  The largest footwear factory produced approximately 11% of adidas-Salomon's footwear
sourcing volume in 2004. 

Growing Importance of Asia for Apparel Production
In apparel,  too,  Asian countries dominated purchases
in 2004.  China and Indonesia were the largest sourcing
countries,  representing 20% and 17% of total apparel
production.  The remaining 63% was produced in other
Asian countries,  Europe and the Americas with 40%17% and 6% respectively.  The largest apparel factory
produced 6% of our total apparel purchases in 2004. 

32

Hardware Produced Close to Market 
Footwear Production by Region 
Americas 2%
Europe 4%
Asia 94%

With respect to hardware,  adidas-Salomon focuses on
producing as close to our major markets as possible. 
Salomon hardware is largely manufactured by subcontractors in Romania and Asia.  Additionally,  Salomon,  Mavic
and Cliché also maintain own production sites in Francewhich concentrate on high-end products and new technological developments.  The majority of TaylorMade golf
club components are produced in China and then assembled by TaylorMade in the major markets.  Most golf balls
marketed by TaylorMade-adidas Golf are produced by the
Dunlop Slazenger Group in the USA. 

Responding to Quota Removal 
Apparel Production by Region 
Americas 6%

Asia 77%
Europe 17%

With the expiry of the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing
(ATC) in January 2005,  quotas on apparel trade between
member countries of the World Trade Organization (WTO)
have been eliminated.  While there will be few immediate implications in 2005 with regard to our sourcing
strategy,  we are well prepared to capitalize on lower
purchase prices for apparel products from countries
previously covered by quotas.  In addition,  we have taken
the necessary steps that will enable us to increase
product sourcing in the most competitive countries in the
medium term.  In the long run,  taking advantage of
increasing economies of scale in the post-quota era will
help us to further reduce our sourcing costs. 

Special Projects Reduce Lead Times in Apparel
Reducing our lead times the time elapsing for product
creation,  order placement,  raw material preparationmanufacturing and delivering products to retail is a
major priority within our Group as this enables us to
create products best tailored to meet current market
needs and improve customer service.  In 2004,  thereforewe initiated several special projects in the apparel sector. 
We expanded a special program within our football
category aimed at reducing the time between retailer
purchase orders and product delivery.  This programwhich has the benefit of increasing sales while reducing
inventory costs and close-out sales,  now enables us
to provide many of our products within this category in a
30-day replenishment cycle.  We also implemented a 
'Never Out of Stock" concept for basic apparel products. 
Based on current market signals such as sell-through
information,  these products are also manufactured on a
30-day lead time,  enabling us to buy less inventory upfront and to provide a higher level of service to retailers. 

Footwear Projects Help Maximize At-Once Business
Opportunities
In 2004,  we also made major headway in further reducing our footwear lead times (–8%).  Equally importantwe are working with our retail partners to capitalize on
the commercial opportunities resulting from the increasing importance of the at-once business in the sporting
goods industry.  Therefore,  we have designed and implemented a 'Read and Replenish" concept.  It allows certain
customers to buy an initial small quantity of a productget market feedback and order more of the product,  which
will then be replenished within seven to 14 days.  This
enables the customer to test selected fashion styles and
colors with low inventory risk and high sales potential. 

Improving Services to Retailers a Priority
Better servicing our customers is an integral part of our
Global Operations activities.  In 2004,  we focused on
improving our services to retailers in terms of providing
floor-ready merchandise.  For selected accounts,  products were specifically labeled and packed at the factory
based on retailer requirements instead of in warehouses
or at retail.  This avoids the repacking steps we previously
went through in other locations and means that more of
our product can be shipped directly from the factories
to retail.  This takes both time and cost out of the supply
chain.  We will roll out this service to additional retail
accounts in 2005.

With an increase of more than 30% our share was one
of the top performers in the DAX-30,  Germany's premiere stock index.  In addition,  the proposed dividend
increase and our extended dividend policy reflect our
efforts to continually enhance value to our shareholders.

The performance of stock markets worldwide was largely
positive during 2004.  However,  this development was
mainly driven by strong increases at the end of the year. 
The development of most major indices was disappointing throughout the first nine months of the year as a
result of ongoing uncertainties regarding global terrorism
and the geo-political situation in the Middle East as well
as the strong oil price surge and its potential impact on
global economic activity.  It was only after a significant
easing of commodity prices had set in that equity markets
began to appreciate significantly during the last quarter
of the year.  In contrast,  the adidas-Salomon share price
advanced in all four quarters and strongly outperformed
both the DAX-30,  Germany's premiere stock index,  as
well as the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI)
World Textiles,  Apparel & Luxury Goods Index during the
12-month period.

While largely better-than-expected economic data
supported an improvement of the global stock markets
at the beginning of the year,  ongoing concerns related to
global terrorism and uncertainties surrounding the geopolitical situation in the Middle East slowed overall
market performance at the end of the first three months
of the year.  Nevertheless,  the adidas-Salomon share
advanced during the first quarter.  After having reached
its year low of € 8876 in February as a result of developments surrounding the bankruptcy of a major US sporting goods retailer,  disappointing labor market data and a
strong decline in consumer confidence in the USA,  the
adidas-Salomon share price rebounded solidly towards
the end of the reporting period.  This was mainly a result
of the positive 2004 outlook in general,  and in particular
with regard to the situation in North America,  provided
by adidas-Salomon's Management during the analyst
conference on the occasion of the Group's final full year
results release in March.

Although leading indicators reflected a largely positive
development of the global economic environment,  fears
that a variety of factors (e.g.  rising oil prices and interest
rates) might hamper worldwide economic activity put
pressure on equity markets and the adidas-Salomon
share during the second quarter.  In addition,  disappointing news flow regarding European sales and backlogs
within the sporting goods industry negatively impacted
the adidas-Salomon share price development during
the first half of the three-month period.  However,  significant share price increases driven by adidas-Salomon's
positive first quarter results,  encouraging US and
Chinese economic data as well as increased sector
awareness due to the European Football Championships
more than offset previous declines.

Equity markets as well as the adidas-Salomon share
advanced solidly during the fourth quarter.  Initiallyhowever,  a record-high oil price and the related uncertainties regarding global economic development led to
significant declines.  The clear outcome of the US presidential election,  positive corporate news flow and a
strong decline of the oil price subsequently all supported
significant increases for most major indices and the
adidas-Salomon share during the remainder of the
period.  As a result,  our share price reached its year high
of € 12093 in November and stood at € 11875 at the
end of the year.  With an increase of 32% compared to the
2003 year-end level,  the adidas-Salomon share strongly
outperformed the MSCI World Textiles,  Apparel & Luxury
Goods Index,  which increased 25% during the same
period.  In addition,  our share was not only significantly
ahead of the DAX-30,  which increased 7% in 2004,  but
was also one of the top three performers within the stock
index. 

Worldwide stock market development was disappointing
during the third quarter.  In addition to the ongoing concerns surrounding global terrorism and the geo-political
situation in the Middle East,  it was mainly the continued
strong surge in commodity prices,  notably oil,  and its
possible impact on future economic growth that put a
strain on most major indices.  While the adidas-Salomon
share was also affected by these factors,  it was nevertheless able to improve strongly during this period.  Driven
by the Group's impressive quarterly results,  increased
earnings guidance for 2004 and newly announced mediumterm profitability targets,  our share price advanced
vigorously throughout the months of August and September.  With an increase of almost 15%,  the adidas-Salomon
share was the top performer within the DAX-30 during
the third quarter.

Membership in High-Quality Indices
The adidas-Salomon share is included in a variety of
high-quality indices around the world which act as
indicators for the development of the respective markets
and regions.  Most importantly,  as one of the 30 largest
exchange-listed companies in Germany,  our share is
included in the DAX-30.  According to the two key criteriamarket capitalization and 12-month average equity
turnover,  our share was ranked number 21 (2003: 23)
and 22 (2003: 19) in the DAX-30 at the end of 2004
respectively,  as reported by Deutsche Börse.  Our share
is also a member of the Dow Jones STOXX,  the Dow
Jones EURO STOXX and the MSCI World Index as well as
all corresponding sector indices.  In addition,  the adidasSalomon share is a member of the FTSE4Good Europe
Index and was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability
Indexes for the fifth consecutive year.  These positions
highlight our successful efforts and ongoing commitment to combine a strong financial performance with the
dedication to environmental sustainability,  a positive
relationship with our stakeholders and the determination
to support human rights (see our Social and Environmental Report). 

Extensive and Positive Analyst Coverage
In 2004,  more than 30 banks published research reports
on adidas-Salomon on a regular basis,  reflecting our
relevance and recognition within the financial community.  The majority of these analysts (61%) issued 'buy"
recommendations for our share in their latest publication during the 12-month period.  Another 36% recommended investors to 'hold" our share.  Only 3% issued a
'sell" rating for our share.

New Dividend Policy Reflects Commitment to Drive
Shareholder Value 
International Character of Shareholder Base
Maintained 
The adidas-Salomon Executive Board will recommend
paying a dividend of € 130 for 2004 to our shareholders
at the Annual General Meeting on May 4,  2005.  This
represents an increase of 30% versus the prior year and
is the highest dividend in the Group's history.  It reflects
our philosophy of sharing adidas-Salomon's operational
and financial success with our shareholders.  Management's ongoing commitment to improving the Group's
financial condition while also continually increasing
value for our shareholders is also reflected in our new
dividend policy.  Going forward,  adidas-Salomon intends
to pay out between 15 and 25% of consolidated net
income,  representing a significant extension of the previous range of between 15 and 20%.  With a total payout
of approximately € 60 million,  this year's proposal
represents a payout ratio of 19%. 

Based on the amount of invitations to our Annual General
Meeting in May 2004,  we currently estimate that we have
around 85000 shareholders.  According to our latest
annual ownership analysis conducted in April 2004,  our
ownership base continues to be very international.  The
known institutional investors accounted for 84% (2003:
82%) of adidas-Salomon's outstanding shares.  North
Americans held 28% in 2004,  compared to 34% in the
prior year.  German institutional investors accounted for
16% (2003: 16%) of adidas-Salomon's shares,  while other
European investors held 36% of outstanding shares.  This
compares to 28% in 2003.  Holdings of other international
shareholders remained stable at 4%.  Smaller,  undisclosed holdings,  which also include retail investors,  made
up 11% of the shares outstanding (2003: 13%).  adidasSalomon Management,  which comprises current members
of the Executive and Supervisory Boards,  continues to
hold less than 5% in total.  Information regarding Directors'
Dealings can be found in the Corporate Governance section
on our corporate website at www, adidas-Salomon, com
and in the Corporate Governance Overview in this report. 
In order to provide the opportunity for more investors
to participate in adidas-Salomon's future performancewe launched an unrestricted American Depositary Receipt
(ADR) facility in the USA at the beginning of 2005.  Since
January 5,  adidas-Salomon ADRs trade on the over-thecounter market. 

Investor Relations Activities Increase
Increasing both the frequency and quality of our dialog
with individual and institutional investors remains a
primary goal for us at adidas-Salomon.  In the course of
2004,  adidas-Salomon's Management and the Investor
Relations team spoke at many international conferences
on a wide variety of topics.  In addition,  in order to intensify and enhance the relationship to long-standing
contacts as well as to establish new ones,  we significantly
increased the number of both roadshow days and oneon-ones in 2004.  With more than 60 days on the road and
over 400 one-on-ones,  our contact with analysts and
institutional investors was more frequent than ever before. 
Further,  we have considerably increased our retail
investor presentations and met with representatives from
shareholder interest groups on several occasions.  In
October 2004,  we invited the financial community to
participate in our fifth annual Investor Day at our headquarters in Herzogenaurach.  By presenting current
targets and strategies for the Group as a whole as well
as for the different brands and regions to investors and
analysts,  we continued to increase adidas-Salomon's
visibility within the financial community.  In order to make
this information available to as wide an audience as
possible,  all documents that were presented during
the event are available on our corporate website at
www, adidas-Salomon, com.  In addition,  adidas-Salomon
webcasts all its analyst conferences as well as the
Annual General Meeting live on the Internet.  Archived
versions of these events and all related information
remain available anytime thereafter.  Furthermoreadidas-Salomon's website offers an interactive analysta tool allowing for a detailed analysis of the Group's
historical financial performance.

Campaigns. 
'Impossible Is Nothing"
is the essence of the brand,  a phrase at the heart of adidas.  It sums up how a marathoner
approaches the race,  and how a manager approaches a new challenge. 
In 2004,  adidas communicated this attitude for the Sport Performance division. 
Its purpose was to relaunch and reinvigorate the brand in the eyes of the target consumer. 
In addition to the 'Impossible Is Nothing" campaign for Sport Performance,  we
had other brand communication success stories to talk about in 2004,  from 'Respect ME"
for Sport Heritage to Salomon's 'Reflection on Instinct" and TaylorMade's 'What drives you?". 
These are just a few of the most exciting campaigns we produced in 2004 and can be seen
on the next few pages.  These have been our most successful and critically acclaimed
communication efforts to date.

the desire to push ourselves further,  to surpass limits,  to break new ground.  The fully integrated communication
campaign shows the rich stable of adidas athletes including boxing legend Muhammad Ali,  long-distance runner Haile
Gebrselassie,  football icon David Beckham and NBA star Tracy McGrady,  who challenge the impossible by taking riskssetting new records,  changing conventions.  The campaign featured athletes from various sports and regions,  showcasing adidas' unrivaled broad involvement in sports and our unique relationships with athletes.  This campaign has won
99 awards so far,  including a Golden Lion in Cannes.  'Impossible Is Nothing" will continue to play an integral role in

Celebrate Originality
The new adidas Originals campaign shifts its focus from product stories to brand image.  The new direction is part of
our pro-active fashion distribution strategy and is supported by an advertising campaign that 'Celebrates Originality". 
Fashion guru and photographer Karl Lagerfeld translated this into seven exciting double- and single-page visuals. 
While the first ads broke globally in February 2005 issues of key lifestyle and fashion publications,  media coverage on
the campaign was already extensive in 2004. 

64

Respect ME
The objective of the 'Respect ME" concept and collection is to re-establish adidas' urban street credibility while
simultaneously contemporizing the Trefoil for hip hop's newer generation.  Twenty years ago,  Run DMC cultivated the
'80s hip hop signature style and placed adidas at the forefront of urban athletic and street style.  This led to their
legendary song 'My adidas".  Today,  Missy Elliott and adidas provide a new message based on shared values such as
authenticity,  originality and innovation that calls for positivism,  empowerment,  style,  skills,  friendship and,  above allrespect. 

Y-3
This Y-3 advertising campaign was launched globally in February 2005.  The ads visually highlight freedom of
movement,  while also celebrating the fusion of sport and style.  Media focus has been on influential high-end fashion
magazines as well as a careful selection of opinion-forming media and newspapers in Europe,  the USA and Asia.

consumers are looking for in Salomon products such as unrestricted style,  sensation and adventure in whatever the
environment in one television commercial.  To bring all this to life on the screen,  the makers used experimental photo
techniques such as animated picture runs,  morphing effects and video.  The commercial features Salomon's worldrenowned ski and snowboard icons,  Kaj Zackrisson,  Candide Thovex,  David Benedek and Torah Bright.

ECONOMIC AND SECTOR DEVELOPMENT

2004 was another successful year for the Group in terms of
financial performance.  Currency-neutral sales increased
by 7%.  In euro terms,  sales increased 3% to € 6478 billion
in 2004 from € 6267 billion in 2003.  The gross margin
improved strongly,  increasing by 23 percentage points to
472%,  mainly driven by favorable currency developmentslower clearance sales combined with higher clearance
margins,  our improving product mix and increased adidas
own-retail activities.  Despite an increase in operating
expenses,  operating profit grew 18% to € 580 million in
2004 versus € 490 million in 2003.  Income before taxes
increased 19% to € 520 million in 2004 compared to
€ 438 million in 2003.  Reduced minority interests and a
slightly lower tax rate further helped to drive the 21%
growth in adidas-Salomon's net income to the record level
of € 314 million in 2004.  These results reflect increases
which are more than twice as high as the initial earnings
guidance communicated at the beginning of 2004.  As a
consequence,  basic earnings per share were € 688.  For
2005,  Management has again set ambitious targets including a projected mid- to high-single-digit currency-neutral
sales increase and growth of the Group's net income of
between 10 and 15% on a comparable basis. 

Robust Economic Development in 2004
Global economic activity was robust throughout 2004.  Driven
by a strengthening of domestic demand in many countries
around the world,  the pace of global economic activity accelerated during the first few months of the year.  However,  as
 result of renewed geopolitical uncertainties and the sharp
increase in commodity prices,  notably oil,  the pace of economic growth has since moderated gradually,  while still
maintaining positive momentum in most regions. 

Only Modest Growth in Europe
In Europe,  economic activity grew at only a modest pace in
2004.  While growth was solid during the first two quarterseconomic recovery slowed considerably in the second half of
the year.  Both the extent and the composition of growth
differed widely across the region.  While noticeably slowing
in the second half of the year,  economic growth was nevertheless strong in 2004 in the UK,  France and the region's
emerging markets.  As a result,  consumers sentiment
improved significantly in these countries in the course of
the year.  In contrast,  consumer spending was practically
stagnant in Italy and Germany.  In the latter market,  both
consumer and business confidence remained depressed
throughout the year as a result of high unemployment ratesthe strong appreciation of the euro and oil price increases. 
The region as a whole posted GDP growth of around 2%. 

North American Economy Grows Robustly Throughout
the Year
In North America,  the combination of ongoing fiscal and
monetary stimuli supported strong growth in private demand
at the beginning of 2004.  However,  lower-than-expected labor
market data led to a strong decline in US consumer confidence at the end of February.  As a result,  private consumption
slowed down markedly during the second quarter.  While both
consumer spending and confidence rebounded again in the
second half of the year,  with the latter reaching its highest
level in more than two years at the end of July,  overall economic activity returned to lower growth levels towards the
end of the 12-month period.  The region's GDP increased 4%
compared to the prior year,  reflecting robust development
throughout the year.

Asian Economies Grow Strongly in 2004
Japan's economic expansion continued in 2004 with particularly robust growth at the beginning of the year.  While this
positive development was mainly led by a continued rise in
export growth,  strong external demand gradually spilled over
into the domestic sector.  Driven by steady improvements in
the country's labor market,  consumer spending increased as
the year progressed and consumer confidence reached its
highest level in more than eight years at the end of September.  However,  GDP growth slowed throughout the year mainly
due to a marked deterioration of the export sector.  In most
other countries in the region,  economic activity decelerated
gradually during the second half of the year after expanding
very robustly in the first two quarters.  While domestic demand
continued to be strong throughout the year,  export growth
eased somewhat after having peaked halfway through the
year.  China was the exception,  however,  with economic growth
being the strongest at the end of the year.  The region as a
whole recorded GDP growth of 7% in 2004.

Widespread Economic Growth in Latin America
In Latin America,  macroeconomic signals were very positive
during 2004,  resulting in a 5% GDP increase for the region. 
Growth momentum remained robust throughout the year with
strong export activities continuously spilling over into
stronger domestic demand.  In Argentina,  the economy grew
at a rapid pace,  supported by a pick-up in domestic demandwhich is mainly a reflection of easier monetary conditions and
 recovery in real wages,  as well as strong global demand. 
In Mexico,  economic activity also accelerated considerably in
2004,  benefiting from increased import demand in the US
economy and a surge in business investment.  In Brazil,  consumer spending remained somewhat subdued,  in particular
at the beginning of the year.  Nevertheless,  economic expansion in this country was very robust in 2004,  driven by strong
exports and more lively domestic activity.

rates at quarter-end 
The sporting goods industry developed positively in 2004. 
However,  performance was uneven across the different
regions.  In Europe,  sporting goods retailers were confronted
with a difficult market environment reflecting the financial
problems that arose at a broad range of retailers during the
year.  While the UEFA EURO 2004™ European Football Championships increased brand awareness for the major sporting
goods suppliers and lifted demand for certain product categories,  inventory levels at retail remained high throughout
2004.  This led to aggressive pricing strategies,  in particular
in the UK. 

In the USA,  consolidation in the retail sector accelerated as
 result of the bankruptcy of two major athletic specialty
retailers and two high-profile mergers in the sporting goods
channel.  Nevertheless,  retailers and suppliers reported
strong results,  reflecting an encouraging and less promotional environment.  This is also mirrored in the development
of average selling prices which increased modestly for the
first time in several years.  In combination with an increased
number of units sold in both categories,  these developments
led to industry growth of 4%,  in line with GDP development in
the USA. 

Largely Positive Development in Asia and Latin America
The Asian retail environment improved in 2004.  Increasing
consumer confidence drove growth for the sporting goods
industry in most of the region's markets.  In China,  retail
expansion accelerated in 2004.  In Japan,  however,  the
footwear market remained oversaturated,  which led to a
noticeable sales decline in the segment.  The lifestyle apparel
market remained the primary source of growth for sporting
goods suppliers in this region.  In addition,  performance
apparel sales were supported by global sporting events.  In
Latin America,  economic momentum and improved market
conditions supported solid growth of the sporting goods
industry in the region.

Currency-Neutral Sales in Europe Up 3%

Net Sales € in millions 
adidas-Salomon Currency-Neutral Sales Grow 7%
Currency-neutral sales for the Group grew by 7% with increased
sales coming from all brands and all regions.  Sales in euro
terms were negatively impacted by the strong appreciation of
the euro versus most major currencies due to the fact that a
large portion of the Group's revenues are generated in noneuro currencies.  As a result,  Group sales increased 3% in
euros to € 6478 billion in 2004 from € 6267 billion in 2003.

From a brand perspective,  sales in the adidas segment grew
8% on a currency-neutral basis.  In euro terms,  sales increased by 5% to € 5174 billion from € 4950 billion in 2003. 
The main driver of currency-neutral growth was improvement
in the Sport Performance division,  in football and all major
apparel categories.  These improvements more than compensated for footwear sales declines in other categories.  In
addition,  double-digit growth in the Sport Heritage divisionwhich was driven by increases in both footwear and apparelcontributed to the overall sales growth at brand adidas. 
Salomon sales grew 2% on a currency-neutral basis with
increases coming from both the winter and summer sports
categories.  Performance was particularly strong in the
apparel,  cycling and nordic categories which more than
offset lower skating and alpine revenues.  Sales in euro
terms declined 1% to € 653 million in 2004 from € 658 million in 2003.  TaylorMade-adidas Golf sales grew by 5% on a
currency-neutral basis,  driven by double-digit increases in
the metalwood and apparel categories as well as solid growth
in footwear.  However,  these increases were partly offset by
lower irons,  putter and golf ball revenues.  In euro termsTaylorMade-adidas Golf sales declined by 1% to € 633 million
from € 637 million in 2003.

Sales for adidas-Salomon in Europe grew 3% on a currencyneutral basis.  In euro terms,  sales also increased 3% to
€ 3470 billion in 2004 from € 3365 billion in 2003.  This
growth was driven by adidas and Salomon.  Sales at brand
adidas grew 4% on a currency-neutral basis and 3% in euro
terms to € 2947 billion in 2004 from € 2851 billion in 2003primarily as a result of solid growth in the UK,  France and
Iberia as well as particularly strong performance in the
region's emerging markets.  Salomon also grew,  with European
currency-neutral revenues up 3% in 2004.  In euros,  Salomon
sales increased 2% to € 428 million in 2004 (2003: € 418 million).  This development was driven by sales improvements
in Austria,  Italy and Eastern Europe.  Currency-neutral sales
for TaylorMade-adidas Golf were down 2% mainly due to a
decline in the UK.  In euro terms,  TaylorMade-adidas Golf sales
remained stable at € 96 million (2003: € 96 million). 

North American Currency-Neutral Sales Increase 4%
In North America,  sales for the Group grew 4% on a currencyneutral basis supported by higher revenues at all brands.  In
euro terms,  this represents a 5% decline to € 1486 billion in
2004 versus € 1562 billion in the prior year.  Sales at brand
adidas increased 4% on a currency-neutral basis.  In euro
terms,  revenues declined 5% to € 1017 billion in 2004 from
€ 1067 billion in 2003.  Salomon sales increased 1% on a
currency-neutral basis.  This represents a decline of 6% in
euro terms to € 154 million in 2004 from € 164 million in

in 2004 from € 1116 billion in 2003.  The currency-neutral
growth was mainly due to brand adidas,  where revenues were
up 21%.  Development at brand adidas was driven by doubledigit increases in many of the region's countries including the
most important markets,  Japan and China.  In euro termsadidas sales in Asia grew 15% to € 968 million in 2004 from
€ 839 million in 2003.  At Salomon,  currency-neutral sales
declined 6%.  This development is mainly related to continued
poor winter business in Japan,  with alpine product sales
showing a significant decline.  In euros,  Salomon sales
declined 9% to € 63 million in 2004 from € 69 million in 2003. 
Currency-neutral sales of TaylorMade-adidas Golf increased
10% due to robust growth in Japan as well as double-digit
increases in nearly all other major Asian markets.  In euro
terms,  sales grew by 6% to € 220 million in 2004 from
€ 207 million in 2003. 

In Latin America,  where revenues are generated predominately by brand adidas,  currency-neutral sales increased 34%
in 2004.  In euro terms,  sales grew 26% to reach € 224 million
in 2004 versus € 179 million in 2003.  This strong development
was led by brand adidas,  where sales grew 34% on a currencyneutral basis and 25% in euro terms to € 217 million in 2004
from € 173 million in 2003.  The main drivers of this growth
were strong double-digit increases in Brazil,  Mexico and
Argentina.  Salomon and TaylorMade-adidas Golf,  while only
minor components in overall sales with revenues of € 5 million (2003: € 4 million) and € 2 million (2003: € 2 million)
respectively in 2004,  continued to grow rapidly at strong

Licensee Revenues Decrease Slightly 
Currency-neutral sales of footwear within the adidas-Salomon
Group increased 1%.  In euro terms,  revenues declined 2% to
€ 2700 billion (2003: € 2767 billion).  Currency-neutral growth
was mainly driven by the adidas Sport Performance football
category.  In other Sport Performance footwear categoriessales declines were recorded.  Strong growth,  however,  also
came from adidas Sport Heritage footwear.  Footwear comprised 42% (2003: 44%) of total Group net sales in 2004reaffirming its position as adidas-Salomon's most important
product category. 

For some product segments or markets,  adidas-Salomon
has license agreements with independent companies,  which
manage the design,  development,  manufacture and distribution of specific product lines.  Currently,  adidas maintains
relationships with 19 licensees in 11 countries who,  in general,  source products from local suppliers in their respective
markets.  In 2004,  net licensee sales decreased by 1% to
€ 538 million from € 542 million in 2003.  This decrease is a
result of currency effects and the acquisition of our longstanding US-based licensee Valley Apparel.  On a like-for-like
basis,  licensee sales would have risen by 7% in 2004,  due
mainly to increases at our licensee in Japan for the distribution of adidas accessories.

In 2004,  apparel sales grew 17% on a currency-neutral basis
reflecting the success of our 'Apparel Breakthrough" initiativewhich is aimed at improving performance in this key category
by utilizing cross-functional teams throughout the Group.  In
euros,  apparel sales increased 13% to € 2519 billion from
€ 2222 billion in 2003.  This represents 39% (2003: 35%) of total
Group revenues.  Positive currency-neutral development in all
major adidas Sport Performance apparel categories as well
as significant increases at adidas Sport Heritage,  Salomon and
adidas Golf apparel all contributed to this increase. 

Hardware Sales Up 2% Currency-Neutral
In 2004,  hardware revenues comprised 19% (2003: 21%) of
total Group net sales and increased 2% on a currency-neutral
basis.  In euros,  hardware sales declined 1% to € 1259 billion
from € 1278 billion in 2003.  The primary drivers of currencyneutral growth were higher football sales at adidas,  reflecting the strong response to our product offering related to
the UEFA EURO 2004™ European Football Championships,  as
well as increases in TaylorMade's metalwood category due
to the launch of our r7® quad driver.  Robust improvements in
Salomon's nordic and cycling categories were further factors
in this positive development.  These increases more than
offset declines in Salomon's alpine category as well as in
TaylorMade's irons,  putters and golf ball business. 

84

Lower Cost of Sales in 2004
As the vast majority of our products are manufactured by
independent contractors and our own production activity is
very limited,  our Group defines cost of sales as the amount
we pay to third parties for expenses associated with producing
and delivering our products.  Similar own-production expensesalthough only a small proportion of the Group's cost of salesare also recorded at adidas,  Salomon and TaylorMade-adidas
Golf.  In 2004,  cost of sales was € 3420 billion,  representing a
decrease of 1% from the € 3453 billion level of 2003.  This
decline was realized despite higher Group sales in euros and
reflects favorable currency effects on purchase prices.  This is
 result of the fact that 70 to 80% of the sourcing volume was
incurred in US dollars,  while the percentage of sales revenues
in US dollars and other non-euro currencies was significantly
lower,  with about half of the Group's sales denominated in
European currencies.  Production and material efficiencies also
contributed to this reduction,  which was achieved despite
increased costs due to a voluntary product recall in North
America and Asia in the second half of the year. 

Record Level Gross Margin Driven by Brand adidas 
Europe Leads Regional Gross Margin Expansion 
The adidas-Salomon gross margin grew 23 percentage points
to 472% in 2004 from 449% in 2003 reflecting the highest
gross margin in the Group's history.  This positive development
was mainly driven by brand adidas where gross margin
improved 36 percentage points to 441% in 2004 from 406%
in 2003.  Favorable currency effects,  lower clearance sales
combined with higher clearance margins,  our improving
product mix as well as increased own-retail activities were
the major factors behind this increase.  At Salomon,  gross
margin declined 04 percentage points to 396% in 2004
versus 401% in 2003.  This decrease was mainly attributable
to negative currency effects,  arising from the fact that nearly
all Salomon hardware production and sourcing takes place in
Europe,  while a large portion of sales is registered in noneuro currencies,  which for the most part depreciated significantly versus the euro in 2004.  Higher margins for cycling
components as well as for apparel could only partly offset
this decline.  TaylorMade-adidas Golf's gross margin grew
15 percentage points to 470% in 2004 from 455% in 2003. 
This increase was mainly a result of higher metalwood margins
due to successful new product launches including our r7®
quad driver.  Better margins in apparel,  which reflect the
continued success of our ClimaCool® and ClimaLite® technologies,  also contributed to the margin improvement.  As a
result of these developments and the Group's sales growthgross profit increased 9% to € 3058 billion in 2004 from
€ 2814 billion in the prior year. 

On a regional basis,  gross margin improvement was driven
by Europe,  reflecting strong gains within brand adidas as
previously described.  In Europe,  the gross margin grew
40 percentage points to 448% in 2004 from 408% in 2003
as a result of favorable currency effects on purchase pricesimproving product mix and increased adidas own-retail
activities.  The gross margin in North America increased
05 percentage points to 349% in 2004 from 343% in 2003. 
This improvement was mainly the result of lower clearance
sales at higher margins and reflects the ongoing upswing in
our North American operations.  In Asia,  the gross margin
grew 22 percentage points to 491% from 468% in 2003,  due
to higher apparel margins as well as the continued expansion
of our adidas own-retail activities.  In Latin America,  the
gross margin was virtually unchanged at 390% in 2004
(2003: 389%).

2004

2003

Operating expenses,  including selling,  general and administrative expenses (SG&A) and depreciation and amortization
(excluding goodwill),  increased by 7% to € 2478 billion in
2004 versus € 2324 billion in 2003.  As a percentage of salesoperating expenses increased 12 percentage points to 383%
in 2004 (2003: 371%).  This development reflects increased
marketing expenditures for the European Football Championships and the Olympic Games.  In addition,  operating
expenses were also negatively impacted by the continued
expansion of adidas own-retail activities,  the investment in
strategic initiatives in Asia and North America,  productionrelated restructuring costs at Salomon as well as higher
doubtful debt provisions at TaylorMade-adidas Golf.  The
structure of the Group's operating expenses remained
relatively unchanged in 2004.  Marketing working budgetwhich consists of advertising and promotional expensesrepresented the majority of these expenses.

The Group's marketing working budget increased 9% to
€ 878 million in 2004 versus € 807 million in 2003,  mainly as
 result of higher spending at brand adidas.  As a percentage
of sales,  this equates to 136%,  an increase of 07 percentage
points versus the prior year's level of 129%.  The primary
drivers of this increase were expenditures related to the
European Football Championships as well as the Olympic
Games.  These investments were taken to further strengthen
the strategic position of the Group's core brand. 

Retail Increases Drive Employee Growth
At December 31,  2004,  adidas-Salomon employed 17023
people.  This represents an increase of 9% since the end
of 2003 when the Group employed 15686 people.  New
employees were primarily added in own-retail activities at
brand adidas.  At the end of 2004,  45% of our total employees
were women and 55% were men.  Of the executive management positions,  21% were held by women and 79% were held
by men.  Personnel expenses (including production) increased
10% to € 782 million in 2004 from € 709 million in 2003 (see
note 25).  Costs which are directly attributable to production
are included within the cost of sales.  Extensive reporting
regarding our employees is included in our Social and Environmental Report 2004.

adidas-Salomon Commitment to R&D
adidas-Salomon believes that innovation and design leadership are critical to the sustained success of our Group.  As a
result,  we invest considerable resources into continuously
developing technological innovations and contemporizing our
design philosophy to best unite the needs of our consumers
and our brand values.  The design and development process is
driven by in-house teams of designers,  product developers
and experts for biomechanics,  materials technology,  product
and process engineering and similar disciplines.  At year-end
2004,  adidas-Salomon employed 1011 people in R&Dproduct development and supporting functions.  This represents an increase of 3% from the prior year's level of 985
employees. 

Multinational R&D Activities at adidas-Salomon
The majority of research and development activities for brand
adidas are located in Herzogenaurach,  Germany,  and Portland/Oregon,  USA.  For Salomon and TaylorMade-adidas Golfthe research and development of products is located at each
segment's respective headquarters in Annecy,  France and
Carlsbad/California,  USA. 

R&D Expenses Increase Slightly in 2004
In 2004,  expenses for research and development increased
by 3% to € 88 million,  compared to € 86 million in 2003 due
to higher personnel expenses related to the increase in
employees in 2004.  Other related expenses for product development and market research,  for example,  were incurred as
part of the Group's other operating expenses.

Operating profit for the Group increased 18% to € 580 million
in 2004 from € 490 million in 2003.  As a result,  the operating
margin increased 11 percentage points to 90% in 2004 from
78% in 2003.  This improvement was a result of the Group's
sales increase and record-level gross margin.  From a brand
perspective,  adidas operating profit grew 43% to € 523 million
in 2004 from € 365 million in 2003 as sales growth and
gross margin expansion more than offset increased operating
expenses.  Salomon operating profit declined by 74% to
€ 9 million in 2004 from € 35 million in 2003.  This development was mainly a result of production-related restructuring
costs but also reflects unfavorable currency effects on both
sales and cost of sales.  At TaylorMade-adidas Golf,  operating
profit declined 11% to € 60 million in 2004 from € 67 million
in 2003,  with higher provisions for doubtful debt and increased
marketing working budget related to new product launches,  in
particular the r7® quad driver,  being the major factors behind
the decrease.

In 2004,  the Group's positive operating profit development was
driven by improvement in all regions except North America. 
In Europe,  operating profit grew 21% to € 644 million in 2004
from € 534 million in 2003.  This was mainly generated by
operating profit improvements at adidas.  In North Americathe increased gross margin was more than offset by lower
sales in euro terms and higher operating expenses as a
percentage of net sales despite an absolute reduction.  As a
result,  operating profit declined by 14% to € 79 million in
2004 from € 92 million in 2003.  In Asia,  operating profit grew
28% to € 244 million in 2004 from € 191 million in 2003.  The
strong sales and gross margin increases more than offset
higher operating expenses,  which were mainly related to
the continued expansion of adidas own-retail activities in
the region.  In Latin America,  operating profit grew 53% to
€ 38 million in 2004 from € 25 million in 2003.

Goodwill amortization increased by 3% to € 46 million in 2004
from € 45 million in the prior year.  The purchase of the
remaining shares of adidas Turkey was the main driver of this
increase.  The largest component of the Group's goodwill
amortization was the approximately € 30 million related to the
1998 acquisition of the Salomon group,  which was being
amortized over 20 years until the end of 2004 (see note 11). 

Income Before Taxes by Quarter € in millions 
Net Financial Expenses Increase 
Q1 2004

Net financial expenses increased 16% to € 57 million in 2004
from € 49 million in 2003,  mainly as a result of positive
effects from the valuation of balance sheet items in foreign
currency in 2003 which did not occur to the same extent in
2004.  A slight decrease in net interest expenses to € 58 million in 2004 (2003: € 59 million) and an increase in the other
financial result to € 5 million in 2004 (2003: € 0 million) partly
offset the negative effects from the valuation of balance
sheet items denominated in foreign currency.  The increase
in the other financial result is mainly due to income from
financial investments,  which increased significantly in 2004.

Income Before Taxes Grows 19%

before taxes increased by 10 percentage points to 80% in
2004 from 70% in 2003,  reflecting further improvement of
the Group's profitability level.

Net Income Up 21%
Net income for the Group reached a record level of € 314 million in 2004,  up 21% compared to the prior year's level of
€ 260 million.  This increase is more than twice as high as
the initial earnings guidance provided by Management at the
beginning of 2004.  The main drivers of this development were
strong IBT performance and lower minority interests,  which
declined 19% to € 9 million in 2004 from € 11 million in 2003
mainly due to the acquisition of the remaining shares of
adidas Turkey and Salomon & Taylor Made Japan.  In additiona reduction of the Group's tax rate by 02 percentage points to
378% from 380% in 2003 also positively impacted net income
in 2004. 

Basic Earnings Per Share Increase to € 688
In 2004,  basic earnings per share were € 688 versus € 572
in 2003.  This represents a 20% year-over-year increase.  The
total number of shares outstanding increased by 405250
shares in 2004 to 45859000 as a result of stock options
exercised as part of Tranches II,  III and IV of the Management
Share Option Plan (MSOP) of adidas-Salomon AG (see note
32).  Diluted earnings per share increased 14% to € 654 in
2004 from € 572 in 2003.  The dilutive effect mainly results
from approximately four million additional potential shares
that could be created in relation to our outstanding convertible bond,  for which conversion criteria were met for the first
time at the end of the fourth quarter of 2004 (see note 28).

In January 2005,  adidas-Salomon launched an unrestricted
sponsored American Depositary Receipt (ADR) program to
enable more US investors to participate in the Group's future
performance.  Furthermore,  as a result of stock options
exercised as part of various tranches of the Management
Share Option Plan (MSOP) of adidas-Salomon AG,  the
number of outstanding shares increased by 81050 shares
to 45940050.  To further optimize the Group's financing
structure,  adidas-Salomon mandated a group of banks to
arrange a syndicated loan facility in the amount of € 800 million in December 2004,  which was signed in February 2005. 
The purpose of the transaction was to replace medium-term
lines,  which the Group had terminated in the summer,  at
more attractive terms,  thus helping to further improve
adidas-Salomon's financing structure.  The syndicated loan
facility matures in 2010 and carries two options,  each for
 one-year extension. 

Strategic Initiatives Announced
In January 2005,  adidas-Salomon announced several strategic initiatives,  including a long-term agreement with FIFAan eight-year partnership with the English football club
Chelsea FC to start in 2006,  as well as sponsorship agreements for the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games.

1) For 
absolute figures see Consolidated Balance Sheet 
Fixed Assets Stable
Fixed assets (including financial assets) were stable at
€ 1130 billion in 2004 (2003: € 1128 billion).  An increase
resulted from additions in the amount of € 183 million
mainly due to the expansion of own-retail activities,  IT infrastructure and goodwill additions.  This was counterbalanced
by depreciation and amortization including goodwill of
approximately € 162 million as well as currency effects of
approximately € 11 million.  Disposals reduced fixed assets
by an additional € 8 million. 

Other Non-Current Assets Decrease by 2%
Other non-current assets were reduced by 2% to € 103 million
in 2004 from € 105 million in 2003.  The decrease is mainly
due to higher prepayments associated with new or extended
long-term promotion contracts in 2003 which did not recur
to the same extent in 2004. 

Other Current Liabilities Increase by 33%
Other current liabilities rose 33% to € 184 million in 2004
(2003: € 139 million).  This increase is mainly due to higher
VAT tax liabilities resulting from the growth in business. 

Other Non-Current Liabilities Reduced by 13%
Other non-current liabilities decreased by 13% to € 31 million
in 2004 from € 35 million in 2003,  primarily due to a lower
negative fair value of financial instruments used for hedging
activities within the Group and a decrease in obligations under
capital lease contracts. 

Equity Ratio Improves Further,  Financial Leverage at
Lowest Level Since Salomon Acquisition
The Group's equity base was further strengthened in 2004
despite negative currency effects.  Shareholders' equity rose
20% to € 1628 billion in 2004 from € 1356 billion in 2003. 
The majority of the net income from 2003 was retained within
the Group and used to strengthen the equity base.  Negative
effects,  however,  came from the translation of foreign subsidiaries' equity into euro at year-end due to exchange rate
movements.  As a matter of corporate policy,  adidas-Salomon
hedges for the translation of local balance sheets only in very
limited circumstances.  In such cases,  if certain criteria are
met,  we may use changes in functional currencies of foreign
subsidiaries,  changes in the currency denomination of their
monetary assets,  or hedging with forward contracts or options
for this purpose.  In addition,  the hedging reserve resulting
from the fair valuation of financial instruments used for
product sourcing negatively impacted the year-end equity
balance (see note 23).  The equity ratio rose by 44 percentage
points to 368% in 2004 from 324% in 2003.  Financial leverage
improved 33 percentage points to 36% in 2004 versus 70% in
the prior year.

The Group's cash provided by operating activities is used for

payment of dividends.  Cash outflows for investing activities
were € 360 million in 2004,  an increase of 51% versus the
2003 level of € 238 million,  and included the purchase of
tangible,  intangible and financial assets.  Spending for property,  plant and equipment such as investments in adidas
own-retail activities and IT projects increased by € 7 million
or 6% to € 117 million in 2004 from € 110 million in 2003. 
Cash outflows for investments in intangible assets increased
by € 6 million or 16% to € 41 million versus € 35 million in
2003,  including goodwill resulting from the acquisition of the
remaining shares of Salomon & Taylor Made Japan,  adidas
Turkey and adidas Malaysia.  The net cash used for acquiring
subsidiaries in an amount of € 10 million in 2004 is related
to the acquisition of the US-based former adidas licensee
partner Valley Apparel and the Dutch logistic services
provider Maersk Ewals Logistics B. V.  In 2003,  the Group
acquired no subsidiaries.  The Group used excess cash in
2004 to purchase highly liquid investment funds for an
amount of € 168 million,  more than twice as high as the
prior year's level of around € 80 million.

net borrowings reduction represents the fourth consecutive
year of significant improvements and clearly exceeded
Management's target that was announced at the beginning

average interest rate of gross borrowings 
Interest Rate Development
The weighted average interest rate on the Group's gross
borrowings rose 07 percentage points to 34% in 2004 from
27% in 2003.  The main reason for this increase was the
relatively higher share of fixed interest rate debt.  This
reflects,  as a consequence of the continuing decline of the
Group's debt,  the rising share of longer-term fixed-rate
financings with currently higher interest rates in the total
financing structure.  As a result,  adidas-Salomon will be able
to benefit from historically low interest rates for an extended
period of time.  The calculation of the average interest rate
also includes a higher interest rate than actually paid for the
convertible bond in accordance with IFRS requirements. 

Financing Structure Continues to Improve
In response to the sharp decline in net borrowings during
2004,  we have terminated our Belgian commercial paper
program as well as our multinational asset-backed securities
(ABS) program and did not utilize our German commercial
paper program during 2004.  As a result,  the Group's borrowings of € 1049 billion,  representing a reduction of 14% versus
last year (2003: € 1225 billion),  consist of bank borrowings of
€ 172 million,  reflecting an increase of 39% compared to
€ 124 million in the prior year,  and several private placements
totaling € 592 million,  down 13% from € 684 million in 2003. 
In addition,  € 285 million of the total borrowings are related
to the Group's outstanding convertible bond,  representing
an increase of 2% from € 279 million,  reflecting the accruing
interest on the debt component in accordance with IFRS requirements.  Further,  adidas-Salomon has increased its financial investments by € 170 million or 191% to € 259 million
versus € 89 million in 2003.  For more details on our shortterm financial assets see note 6.

In 2004,  currency-neutral sales for adidas grew 8% reflecting
increases in all regions.  In euro terms,  at € 5174 billionsales were 5% higher than in 2003,  when sales reached
€ 4950 billion. 

Football and 'Apparel Breakthrough" Initiative Drive
Growth in the Sport Performance Division
adidas Sport Performance is the largest division within the
Group and comprised 82% of brand adidas revenues.  Currencyneutral sales in this division grew 6% in 2004.  This represents
an increase of 3% in euro terms to € 4223 billion in 2004
from € 4102 billion in 2003.  Underlying growth was driven by
double-digit increases in the football category as a result of
the high demand surrounding the UEFA EURO 2004™ European Football Championships in general and our strong
product offering in particular.  In addition,  strong sales
growth was recorded in all major apparel categories,  reflecting the success of our 'Apparel Breakthrough" initiative. 
These improvements more than compensated for declines in
other footwear categories.  Sales in the division were split on
 relatively equal basis between footwear and apparel. 

Both Apparel and Footwear Categories Increase at Sport
Heritage
The Sport Heritage division contributed 18% to brand adidas
sales.  In 2004,  sales in this division increased 15% on a
currency-neutral basis or 11% in euro terms to € 907 million
versus € 816 million in 2003.  This improvement reflects
significantly increased momentum during the second half of
the year and was largely driven by strong increases in apparelwhere revenues were up 101% on a currency-neutral basis
or 96% in euro terms to € 135 million (2003: € 69 million).  In
addition,  solid increases in footwear also contributed to the
sales growth.  Currency-neutral sales in this category increased 7%,  while revenues in euros grew 4% to € 760 million in 2004 from € 732 million in the prior year.

grew 24% on a currency-neutral basis and in euro terms to
€ 19 million in 2004 (2003: € 15 million),  representing less
than 1% of brand adidas revenues in 2004.  Sales in this
division are evenly divided between footwear and apparel.

emerging markets,  which include Eastern European countries,  the Middle East and Africa,  revenues continued to grow
at strong double-digit rates,  with particularly robust gains in
Russia,  where sales increased more than 50%.  Increased
focus on key accounts and adidas own-retail activities were
the main contributors to growth in each of these markets.

by 34% on a currency-neutral basis.  In euro terms,  sales
improved 25% to € 217 million in 2004 from € 173 million in

adidas Own Retail as Important Top-Line Growth Driver 
Strong Gross Margin Expansion Continues 
An increasingly important part of brand adidas revenues are
own-retail activities.  Own retail within adidas consists of four
components: concept stores,  factory outlets,  Internet sales
and concession corners in Asian emerging markets.  At the
end of 2004,  adidas operated 235 concept stores (2003: 173). 
These stores,  which market Sport Performance and/or Sport
Heritage products directly to the consumer,  were the main
driver of the increase of adidas own-retail sales in 2004. 
Major openings included Sport Performance stores in Las
Vegas,  London and Osaka as well as Sport Heritage stores in
Barcelona,  Boston and Moscow.  Factory outlets,  which are
utilized to optimize clearance activities for brand adidascurrently number 206 (2003: 174) and are responsible for the
majority of adidas own-retail revenues.  Internet sales,  which
represent an increasingly important sales vehicle in North
America,  are available at www, adidas, com.  adidas concession
corners,  which provide sales infrastructure in emerging
markets in Asia,  number 202 (2003: 178).  adidas own-retail
activities made up 11% of brand sales in 2004,  up from 9% in
the prior year.  This represents an increase of 30% in currencyneutral terms and 24% in euros to € 555 million in 2004 from
€ 447 million in 2003.  This was driven both by comparable
sales growth and new store openings. 

The adidas gross margin improved 36 percentage points to
441% in 2004 from 406% in 2003.  This development reflects
favorable currency effects,  lower clearance sales combined
with higher clearance margins,  our improving product mix
as well as increased own-retail activities.  The improvement
was supported by higher margins in virtually all categories. 
As a result of the sales increase as well as the gross margin
improvement,  adidas gross profit increased 14% to € 2284 billion in 2004 versus € 2008 billion in 2003. 

Operating Profit Increases 43%

In 2004,  adidas operating expenses increased 7% to
€ 1761 billion from € 1643 billion in the prior year.  As a
percentage of sales,  operating expenses increased 08 percentage points to 340% in 2004 from 332% in 2003.  This
increase mainly reflects expenditures associated with the
European Football Championships and the Summer Olympics
as well as strategic investments in North America and Asia
initiated to accelerate growth trends in these two regions. 
Operating expenses were also impacted by the continued
expansion of our own-retail activities.  However,  solid top-line
growth and overproportionate gross margin expansion drove
adidas operating profit up 43% to € 523 million in 2004 versus
€ 365 million in the prior year.  Similarly,  operating margin
increased strongly by 27 percentage points to 101% versus
74% in the prior year.

€ 658 million in the prior year.  Salomon gross margin
decreased 04 percentage points to 396% of sales in
2004 from 401% in 2003.  This development was mainly
attributable to negative currency effects.  Operating profit
declined 74% to € 9 million in 2004 versus € 35 million
in 2003,  reflecting the cost of the production-related
restructuring program as well as unfavorable currency
effects.

Currency-Neutral Revenues Grow in Summer and Winter
Sports
Winter sports product sales,  about 67% (2003: 67%) or
€ 434 million of Salomon's total revenues in 2004,  increased
1% in currency-neutral terms largely due to strong growth in
the nordic category despite a decline in alpine products.  In
euro terms,  however,  sales declined 1% to € 434 million
(2003: € 440 million).  Summer sports products comprised
33% of revenues in this segment or € 219 million in 2004
(2003: 33% or € 218 million).  Sales of these products grew 2%
in currency-neutral terms and were stable in euros in 2004. 
The main drivers of the underlying improvement were higher
sales in the apparel and cycling categories.  This more than
offset a decline in the skating categoriy.

Europe Drives Currency-Neutral Sales Growth
From a regional perspective,  Europe led currency-neutral
sales growth for Salomon in 2004.  Currency-neutral sales in
the region grew 3%,  driven by improvements in Austria,  Italy
and Eastern Europe.  In North America,  currency-neutral sales
increased 1%.  In both regions,  sales increases were driven by
growth in the apparel category.  Revenues in Asia declined 6%
in currency-neutral terms,  reflecting the continued poor
winter business in Japan as a result of the difficult weather
conditions despite sales improvements in virtually all other
markets.  At the same time,  sales increased in summer
sports.  In Latin America,  currency-neutral sales of Salomon
grew 45%,  albeit from a very small base,  due to growing
market share in Argentina and Brazil as well as strong growth
in Salomon's summer and winter business.  Currency effects
negatively impacted revenues in all regions.  In euro termssales grew 2% in Europe to € 428 million in 2004 from
€ 418 million in 2003.  In North America,  revenues declined
6% in euro terms to € 154 million versus € 164 million in the
prior year.  Asian sales declined 9% in euros to € 63 million in
2004 from € 69 million in 2003.  And in Latin America,  sales
increased 37% in euro terms to € 5 million versus € 4 million
in the prior year. 

Negative Currency Effects Drive Gross Margin Decline
Salomon gross margin declined 04 percentage points to
396% in 2004 versus 401% in 2003.  This decrease was mainly
attributable to negative currency effects,  arising from the fact
that nearly all Salomon hardware sourcing and production
takes place in Europe,  while a large portion of sales is registered in non-euro currencies,  which for the most part depreciated significantly versus the euro in 2004.  In addition,  lower
inline skate margins contributed to the overall decrease. 
Higher cycling component and apparel category margins were
only partly able to offset these declines.  As a result of this
development and lower revenues in euro terms,  Salomon gross
profit declined 2% to € 259 million in 2004 from € 264 million
in 2003.

in 2004 (2003: € 228 million).  As a percentage of sales,  operating expenses increased 35 percentage points to 382%
from 347% in the prior year.  This mainly reflects productionrelated restructuring costs of around € 19 million aimed at
improving Salomon's profitability and further ensuring its
long-term competitiveness.  Furthermore,  additional marketing spending related to the first-time inclusion of the adidas
Cycling business into the Salomon segment contributed to
this increase.  As a result of this development,  the gross
margin decline and lower revenues in euro terms,  operating
profit was down 74% to € 9 million in 2004 from € 35 million

Currency-neutral sales at TaylorMade-adidas Golf grew 5%
during 2004 reflecting improvements in all regions except
Europe.  In euro terms,  full year revenues declined 1% to
€ 633 million in 2004 from € 637 million in 2003. 

Currency-Neutral Sales Growth Driven by New Product
Introductions and Expanding Product Lines
Currency-neutral sales improvement at TaylorMade-adidas
Golf was driven by double-digit increases in the metalwood
and apparel categories as well as solid growth in footwear. 
The metalwood growth was largely due to successful new
product introductions in this category such as our revolutionary r7® quad driver.  As a result,  TaylorMade not only
remained world leader in the industry's largest and most
profitable category but even further strengthened its number
one position in 2004.  Apparel and footwear revenue growth
was driven by the continued strength of our ClimaLite® and
ClimaCool® technologies.  Sales of irons,  putters and golf
balls,  however,  declined. 

Currency-Neutral Sales Growth Strongest in Asia
On a regional basis,  currency-neutral revenue growth in 2004
was driven by strong performance in Asia,  where sales
increased 10% due to robust growth in Japan as well as
double-digit increases in nearly all other major Asian markets.  Currency-neutral sales also increased in North Americaup 4%.  In both of these regions,  underlying sales development
was driven by strong performance in the apparel and metalwood categories.  In Europe,  currency-neutral sales decreased
2%,  mainly as a result of an overall decline in the UK and
lower sales in the irons category.  In Latin America,  currencyneutral sales of TaylorMade-adidas Golf grew 68%,  albeit
from a very small base,  driven by vigorous growth in all
categories.  Negative currency effects impacted TaylorMadeadidas Golf sales performance in all regions except Europe. 
As a result,  Asian revenues in euro terms increased 6% to
€ 220 million in 2004 versus € 207 million in 2003.  In North
America,  sales in euros declined 5% to € 315 million from
€ 331 million in the prior year.  European sales were stable
in euro terms at € 96 million (2003: € 96 million).  And in
Latin America,  sales increased 53% in euro terms in 2004 to

Risk Management The global business landscape of the sporting goods industry remained
highly volatile in 2004 with macroeconomic uncertainties
and rapidly changing consumer preferences.  As a result,  the
adidas-Salomon Group is continually confronted by a variety
of risks while at the same time exploring opportunities to
maximize earnings and increase shareholder value.  Our risk
management system provides the framework for safeguarding our strong competitive position and for sustaining the
success of our Group into the future.

Risk Management System  Principles and Process 
Overall Risk 
At adidas-Salomon we constantly strive to improve our operational and financial performance.  This is often associated with
risks that can result from a multitude of causes.  The ability to
identify,  control and limit the impact of these risks,  while
capitalizing on business opportunities,  is a constant task of
our leadership and the entire organization.  Our risk management is closely linked to each of our core business areas and
is an integral part of our decision-making process.  Our risk
management system is composed of the following elements:
> Risk identification: The starting point of our risk management is the completion and regular review of potential risk
area profiles.  We have identified key risk areas for our
Group,  the sporting goods industry and the environment in
which we operate.  Specific risks within each of these areas
are reviewed regularly by management at different levels
within our organization. 
> Risk measurement: We strive to measure risk in a quantitative manner with an understanding of the potential best
and worst case scenarios and their impact on the shortand long-term financial health of our Group.  Where risks
cannot be quantified,  we qualify them with criteria such as
brand strength erosion and level of severity. 
> Risk analysis: Risk analysis serves as an important basis
for all our decision-making,  whereupon we avoid,  reducetransfer or accept risk as appropriate. 
> Risk controlling: Risk controlling is also embedded in the
Group's decision-making processes.  Resource deployment
or changes in strategic direction are evaluated and
reviewed on a business case basis,  which incorporates
relevant risk components.  In a quarterly or more frequent
rhythm,  we utilize formalized risk and opportunity reporting and monitoring processes in conjunction with our
business unit reviews. 
> Risk management: Our global risk management manual is
at the core of our integrated risk management system.  The
manual outlines the principles,  processes,  tools,  risk areas
and key responsibilities within our Group. 

Based on the compilation of risks explained within this report
and the current business outlook,  no immediate risks have
been identified which could jeopardize the ongoing business
health and viability of adidas-Salomon.  The equity capitalization and earning power of adidas-Salomon form a solid basis
for our future business development.  We have taken appropriate precautions against typical business risks that could
negatively affect our financial standing and profitability
situation.

Personnel 
adidas-Salomon delivers consumer goods to the sporting
goods sector,  which could be negatively impacted by declining
demand in an economic downturn.  Economic downturns in
particular,  but also inflation,  political instability,  as well as
current fashion trends can result in considerable fluctuations
in buying behavior.  adidas-Salomon limits this risk by utilizing
 diverse and global brand and product portfolio,  which
reduces our dependency on the development of individual
markets.  Similarly,  the Group monitors the development of
relevant economic indicators (e.g.  consumer sentiment and
spending) and has implemented a flexible system to react to
these developments,  such as the ability to switch product
offering between regions as appropriate. 

Currency Risks
Most of the Group's currency risks result from the fact that
approximately 70 to 80% of our sourcing is done with suppliers that are primarily located in the Far East and the
products are invoiced mainly in US dollars.  However,  since
our sales to customers are denominated primarily in euros
and other currencies (such as the Japanese yen,  the
Canadian dollar and the British pound),  the Group is exposed
to the risk of exchange rate movements.  Wherever possibleadidas-Salomon uses natural hedges to reduce currency
risks.  However,  the Group has to buy approximately
US$ 15 billion versus other currencies every year,  of which
US$ 11 billion is versus the euro.  To further mitigate the
currency risk,  hedging takes place typically up to 18 months
in advance.  Applied hedging instruments include forward
contracts,  swaps and currency options or combinations of
currency options,  which on the one hand provide protection
against an appreciation of the US dollar,  but on the other
hand allow us to participate in the depreciation of the US
dollar. 

Interest Rate Risks
Significant interest rate changes can have a material adverse
effect on the Group's profitability and liquidity.  To minimize the
risk of a major rise in interest rates,  the vast majority of the
Group's floating rate borrowings are protected with interest
rate caps.  Further,  the Group is committed to continually
reducing its net borrowings in order to minimize interest
expenses.  In 2004,  we decided not to renew maturing interest
rate caps of approximately € 200 million.  Moreover,  adidasSalomon has made use of the historically low longer-term
interest rates in 2003 and 2004 to shift part of its borrowings
from floating to fixed-rate financing arrangements. 

Risks from Competition
The sporting goods industry is a highly competitive sector. 
Many of the major markets in which adidas-Salomon operates
are characterized by a relatively high degree of saturation.  In
order to achieve further growth in these markets,  adidasSalomon must expand its market share at the expense of both
strong global competitors and numerous niche suppliers by
developing new products and market segments.  Neverthelesschanges in the competitive environment can lead to overcapacity,  pricing pressure or lower interest in the Group's
products.  adidas-Salomon strives to reduce this risk by
investing in advertising and sponsorships as well as product
development to ensure a positive brand image and by offering
high-quality products to stimulate ongoing demand in the
Group's product offering.

VALUE CHAIN RISKS

Trade Risks
adidas-Salomon is exposed to risks associated with being
involved in global trade as most of the adidas-Salomon
products are manufactured in the newly industrialized countries of Asia.  These risks include the introduction or increase
of import duties or customs tariffs,  import restrictions or
quotas and other trade restrictions,  political instability,  the
ability to recover from natural disasters as well as problems
arising from local production conditions.  The business activity
of adidas-Salomon could be significantly adversely affected ifas a result of trade restrictions or other occurrences,  production was substantially reduced and adidas-Salomon were
unable to quickly transfer its sourcing to manufacturers in
other countries.  adidas-Salomon limits this risk by working
with large,  well-financed,  industry-leading suppliers,  whichwhen possible,  have facilities in multiple countries.  This
provides flexibility to switch manufacturing within the existing
suppliers from one country to another.  However,  sourcing
from Asia also opens opportunities for the Group if trade
restrictions are abrogated as in the case of cancellation of
textile export quotas between WTO member countries in 2005. 

104

Supplier Risks
The vast majority of adidas-Salomon products are produced
by independent factories in accordance with our technical and
design specifications.  Their delivery performance,  pricing and
product quality are critical to adidas-Salomon.  Most of these
manufacturers are based in Asia,  especially China,  IndonesiaVietnam and Thailand,  and in Turkey (see our Social & Environmental Report).  If adidas-Salomon were prevented from
purchasing footwear from our largest supplier or from one of
the three largest source countries,  this would have a material
impact on the Group's ability to meet consumer demand at
least in the short term.  adidas-Salomon limits this risk by
having a balanced portfolio of suppliers with most being large
and well-financed and therefore able to expand production
capacity quickly should the Group need to sever its relations
with a specific supplier. 

Customer Risks
Changes in the competitive environment among customersin particular the increasing consolidation in sporting goods
retail,  have the potential to impact our business.  As an
example,  the advanced consolidation in the US market puts
considerable pressure on gross margins for all suppliers in
that region.  adidas-Salomon limits this risk by servicing at
least ten key accounts per region to avoid a dependency on
one single retailer.  As a result,  no single customer accounted
for 10% or more of our overall net sales in 2004.  However,  a
strong reduction of business with these retailers could
adversely affect Group sales and profitability.  In addition,  if
any major customer became insolvent or otherwise failed to
pay its debts,  it could have a negative impact on profitability. 
To minimize the risk,  the Group utilizes rigorous credit
processes and adequate provisioning for bad debts. 

OPERATIONAL RISKS

Brand Image and Marketing Expenditure
The success of our Group depends to a large extent on the
image of our brands and our capabilities to market products
that meet consumer preferences.  Therefore,  adidas-Salomon
spends a significant amount on marketing activities which is
mainly dedicated to advertising and contracts with federations,  clubs and athletes.  The Group endeavors to minimize
the risk resulting from the high absolute level of marketing
spending with several actions.  Firstly,  adidas-Salomon conducts market research and trend marketing in the areas of
design,  quality and image,  which is integrated into the Group's
long-term strategic marketing planning.  Secondly,  to limit the
risk associated with sponsorship contracts and campaignsthe Group approaches all major contracts and sponsorship
agreements with a profit center mentality,  working with toptier marketing and advertising agencies to understand all
associated costs/benefits.  And thirdly,  virtually all contracts
include performance incentives and the opportunity for
adidas-Salomon to terminate the agreement under certain
circumstances such as drug abuse. 

Research & Development 
Product Quality,  Liability and Counterfeiting 
Property 
In the sporting goods industry,  potential risks arise from the
rapid development of product technologies as consumer
demand is often linked to new and innovative products.  As a
result,  adidas-Salomon puts significant efforts and investments into the development and enhancement of industryleading performance technologies and trend-setting designs. 
The Group limits this risk by implementing an in-house
innovation program that produces a continuous flow of
cutting-edge technologies.  These technologies are tested
with athletes and consumers to ensure relevance in the
marketplace.  The program is set up to deliver a minimum
of one new innovative technology or major technological
evolution per year and this commitment has been exceeded
since its inception in 2000.  The research and development
team is supported by extensive cooperation with universities
and different research institutes. 

As a supplier of consumer products,  adidas-Salomon can face
legal action if and when defective products are sold.  Apart
from the financial consequences of product liability cases,  for
which we have adequate insurance cover,  these cases may
damage market perception of our products,  resulting in image
impairment.  Through intensive quality control we seek to
minimize these risks.  adidas-Salomon is also exposed to risk
from product counterfeiting and imitation,  which can cause
the loss of sales and damage to our reputation.  The Group
estimates that classical product counterfeiting has a current
volume of less than 10% of the volume of brand adidas sales. 
adidas-Salomon limits this risk through anti-counterfeiting
work,  in particular compliance measurement at suppliers and
taking action against illegal dealers.  The Group is also
exposed to the risk of claims and litigation from third parties
for infringement of their trademark and patent rights.  adidasSalomon therefore utilizes extensive legal protection (generally through registration) and brand safeguard programs such
as working with law enforcement institutions,  investigators
and lawyers worldwide to detect and take action against
product counterfeiting and imitation and carefully researches
new products and product names to identify and avoid potentially conflicting rights of third parties. 

adidas-Salomon products are manufactured,  shipped and
stored all over the world.  Physical damage to premisesproduction units and warehouses can lead to business
interruption.  These risks are mitigated by loss prevention
measures,  which include working with reliable suppliers and
logistics providers who guarantee high safety standards. 
adidas-Salomon also maintains sufficient insurance cover to
prevent financial loss in the event of such damage. 

Own Retail
Brand adidas follows the strategy to distribute a portion of its
products through its own retail shops including Sport Performance stores,  Sport Heritage stores as well as factory outlets.  This strategy was established in order to create an
opportunity to show adidas products in the Group's preferred
way,  independently from retailers' strategies.  However,  this
strategy implies a different risk profile than is the case with
retailers' risks.  We minimize that risk by limiting the portion
of our business which can be generated by own-retail activities.  In addition,  all shops are required to reach aggressive
profitability targets dependent on size,  location and investment in the store.

OTHER RISKS

Financing and Liquidity Risks
Although the Group's level of debt has been considerably
reduced in the past years,  we still believe it is always prudent
to ensure sufficient refinancing possibilities on an ongoing
basis.  During the last few years,  adidas-Salomon has diversified its financing instruments to reduce our dependence on
traditional bank financing.  Therefore the Group initiated a
multinational ABS program and German and Belgian commercial paper programs,  and also issued a convertible bond
as well as several long- and medium-term private placements.  However,  along with the continuing reduction of our
net debt position,  our exposure to refinancing risks has
declined significantly in recent years.  As a result,  the Group
has terminated the € 300 million Belgian commercial paper
program as well as the multinational ABS program.  In addition,  we did not utilize our German commercial paper program during 2004.  In December,  adidas-Salomon mandated a
group of banks to arrange a syndicated loan facility in the
amount of € 800 million.  The purpose of the transaction was
to replace the medium-term lines,  which the Group had
terminated in the summer of 2004,  at more attractive termsthus helping to further improve adidas-Salomon's financing
structure.  Due to the Group's operations around the globeoperating cash is spread over different locations.  Wherever
possible and economically feasible,  cash is concentrated
centrally. 

106

Investment Risks 
Legal Risks and Risks from Regulatory Environment 
As a result of adidas-Salomon's strong cash creation and the
continuous improvement of its debt position,  the Group hasas at December 31,  2004,  invested € 259 million into a variety
of conservative investment funds.  A major decline in the value
of these funds could lead to a reduction in the Group's overall
assets.  To minimize the related risk,  adidas-Salomon diversifies its investments in several respects.  The investments
may be made directly,  such as via a purchase of bonds,  or via
externally managed funds.  Permitted asset classes include
bonds and bond funds,  absolute and total return funds,  funds
of hedge funds and open-end real estate funds.  The Group
applies amount limits for each investment,  but also for each
of the asset classes and for the employed individual asset
management teams.  Direct deposits with banks require a
minimum 'A-" rating of Standard & Poors or a comparable
rating of another leading rating agency.  adidas-Salomon is
advised in its investment decisions by a leading independent
consulting firm for such services. 

As a global corporation,  adidas-Salomon operates under a
wide variety of legal and regulatory frameworks.  Finding
solutions for various legal matters in numerous countries
entails risk for the Group,  especially in the formulation of
contracts,  the protection of intellectual property,  the resolution of legal issues and the taking of legal action.  Based on all
outstanding litigation,  we believe that the foreseeable liabilities resulting from any claims will not materially affect the
consolidated financial position of the Group in 2005 and
beyond.  adidas-Salomon operates in multiple jurisdictions
and virtually all adidas-Salomon entities in the respective
countries receive goods and services from affiliated and third
parties abroad.  These cross-border transactions may be
challenged by the respective revenue and regulatory authorities,  which could lead to additional liabilities and business
disruptions.  Further,  a significant change in the geographic
mix of the adidas-Salomon business as well as changes in
tariffs,  tax rates and regulatory restrictions in individual
countries could affect the profitability and business prospects
of adidas-Salomon.  Internal and external specialists are
assigned to mitigate and resolve the above-mentioned issues. 

Risks from Social and Environmental Factors 
Personnel 
We have continuing responsibilities to our workers and the
environment.  Malpractice in these areas can have a significant impact on the reputation and operational efficiency of our
Group and our suppliers.  To limit this risk,  adidas-Salomon
has established its own Code of Conduct,  the Standards of
Engagement (SOE).  adidas-Salomon suppliers must prove
that they meet the Group's standards and conditions before
they can become business partners.  An internal adidasSalomon team also inspects suppliers' factories on a regular
basis.  These internal audits are verified by extensive independent audits (see our Social and Environmental Report).  In
the event of non-compliance with our SOE,  factory management together with our Social & Environmental Affairs (SEA)
team develops action plans and sets deadlines for compliance
and further improvements.  When a factory continually fails to
meet SOE standards,  business relations are terminated. 

adidas-Salomon's future success is highly dependent on our
employees and their talents.  Our compensation mix,  based on
performance and retention aspects,  is targeted to minimize
the risk posed by the loss of current employees,  particularly
in key positions.  In addition,  the Group has implemented
various development programs,  which are designed to extend
our employees' current and future competencies,  to identify
and develop succession candidates for senior management
vacancies quickly and reliably and to shape leadership skills
for our future leaders.  Our programs utilize e-learningon-the-job training,  campus programs,  diverse forms of
coaching and international as well as cross-functional
exchange programs to secure access to talent at the entry
level.  Partnerships with universities and colleges are an
integral part of our Emerging Employees program (see our
Social and Environmental Report). 

Information Technology
adidas-Salomon utilizes a complex network of communications and IT applications in its business activities.  Therefore
natural disaster,  criminal mischief or IT mismanagement can
result in severe disruptions to our business.  We employ
various methods to mitigate these risks,  including proactive
maintenance,  the utilization of hardware and software
experts,  firewall and encryption technologies and business
continuity planning.  Our wide area network (WAN) connections are set up in such a way as to prevent system-wide
failure and all our dial-up connections to the corporate
Intranet are encrypted.  In addition,  periodic reviews of the
systems architecture and regular renewal of hardware
platforms ensure that the Group meets current business
requirements.

Outlook 2005 is set to be another strong year for
adidas-Salomon.  The Group's positive financial performance
in 2004 as well as our strong product pipeline and marketing
initiatives give us confidence that we will again be able to
deliver positive top- and bottom-line performance this year. 
Macroeconomic signals indicate that the global economy and
the sporting goods sector are likely to offer a mixed but
slightly less stimulating environment in 2005.  Howeverstrong backlog development,  high expectations for adidas
own-retail activities and retailer feedback for all our brands
support the Group's mid- to high-single-digit revenue
growth expectations on a currency-neutral basis.  As a result
of continued gross margin strength and improved operating
expenses as a percentage of sales,  we also intend to further
expand our operating margin and deliver net earnings
comparable growth of between 10 and 15%. 

108

Global Economy Likely to Decelerate in 2005

Mixed Outlook for Sporting Goods Sector 
Economic activity in 2005 is likely to be characterized by
regional discrepancies and to decelerate from 2004 levels. 
In Europe,  for example,  GDP is expected to increase by
around 2%.  Growth will be driven overproportionately by the
emerging markets of Eastern Europe.  In Western Europelittle change is expected in the region's high unemployment
rates,  which continue to negatively impact household
incomes,  consumer confidence and consumer spending.  In
addition,  exports are likely to be negatively affected by the
anticipated further strengthening of the euro and the slowing
pace of world trade.  In the USA,  GDP growth of around 3% is
projected.  This represents a slowdown from 2004 levels as
 result of declining fiscal and monetary stimuli,  and increasing pressure on long-standing trade imbalances with other
regions.  However,  a more competitive export environment
driven by the weaker US dollar,  robust business investment
and expected employment increases is likely to prevent the
economy from decelerating too rapidly.  In Asia,  economic
prospects are strongest,  with China likely to perform particularly well (projected GDP growth: 8%).  Nevertheless,  growth
rates in most countries are expected to decline modestlymirroring the global slowdown in export demand.  In Japanfor example,  GDP is expected to grow approximately 1%reflecting the likely impact of tax increases on consumer
spending.  The region as a whole is nevertheless expected
to grow robustly by 6% driven by stronger domestic demand
as a result of higher disposable income.  In Latin Americaregional growth is expected to average 4% in 2005.  Further
strengthening of investment and consumption activities in
many of the region's countries is expected to be the major
contributor to this improvement. 

The sales outlook for the sporting goods sector is also mixed
for 2005.  In Europe,  tough overall retail market conditions
are expected to spill over into the sporting goods industry
during the first six months of the year in the absence of major
sporting events which could spark interest in the sector. 
Retail consolidation is also likely to continue.  In the second
half of the year,  however,  increasing excitement around the
2006 FIFA World Cup™ is expected to support growth in the
sporting goods market.  In the USA,  recent rationalization
within the retail sector and greater distribution differentiation
among suppliers is expected to help higher product sellthroughs and increasing profitability within the industry.  In
Asia,  market conditions will support further retail expansion
in 2005,  which is currently the strongest growth indicator in
the sector.  And in the region's most important market,  Japanfootwear sales are expected to improve versus the depressed
2004 level and apparel sales will continue to perform solidly. 

Mid- to High-Single-Digit Currency-Neutral Sales Growth
Expected in 2005
For 2005,  we expect currency-neutral sales to increase at
mid- to high-single-digit rates,  with growth coming from all
brands and in all regions.  While this takes into account the
economic and sector developments outlined above,  more
importantly it reflects the backlog development and ownretail expectations (which are not included in our backlog
calculation) at brand adidas as well as feedback from retailers
with respect to all of our brands.  Improvements are anticipated in all product categories and we expect this growth to
be largely driven by volume increases. 

New Products as Important Growth Driver in 2005
At adidas-Salomon,  one of our key competitive advantages is
our technological leadership in the sporting goods industry. 
Since 2001,  we have successfully brought at least one major
product revolution or significant evolution per year to the
market.  In 2005,  we will continue to leverage this strength by
further commercializing evolutions of our well established
technologies and introducing several completely new product
technologies to the market.  In addition to these new technologies,  positive development in our largest sports categories
will be the most important factor for our growth expectations
in 2005. 

adidas1 Leads Year of Major Product Innovation
In 2005,  our most important new technology is the adidas1the world's first 'intelligent" running shoe (see Group Activities/
Products).  This revolutionary new product will be supported
by a major advertising initiative in the first half of the year.  In
addition,  new David Beckham,  Stella McCartney,  Missy Elliott
and Muhammad Ali product lines will come to market in the
course of the year.  In the basketball category,  we will deliver
major evolutions for our three top athletes: Tracy McGradyKevin Garnett and Tim Duncan.  We will also continue to evolve
our famous ClimaCool® and a3® adidas Sport Performance
technologies.  And in the fourth quarter,  we will introduce our
first 2006 FIFA World Cup™ products,  highlighted by the
Official Match Ball. 

Own Retail as Important Growth Driver for Brand adidas
Own retail will continue to be an important topic for brand
adidas in 2005.  We expect to open at least 100 concept stores
within the next year.  As a result,  the percentage of revenues
coming from this channel will again surpass 10% of total
adidas sales.  This expansion has been accelerated to allow us
to best showcase the breadth of our products to consumers in
major markets as well as to capture new market potential in
Eastern Europe and smaller Asian countries.  Major openings
include adidas Sport Performance Centers in New York and
Rome as well as new Sport Heritage Concept Stores in Istanbul,  Sydney and Los Angeles.  Because own retail has a higher
than average gross margin,  we also expect this to positively
impact profitability at brand adidas.  However,  operating
expenses and capital expenditures will also include increases
to support the expansion of our own-retail activities.

Strong Backlogs Support Mid- to High-Single-Digit Sales
Growth Expectations for Brand adidas
adidas backlogs at the end of 2004 increased 9% versus the
prior year on a currency-neutral basis.  In euro terms,  this
represents an increase of 7%.  Apparel backlogs grew 14% on
 currency-neutral basis (+12% in euros),  highlighting the
strength of our 'Apparel Breakthrough" initiative.  Footwear
backlogs grew 7% in currency-neutral terms (+4% in euros)reflecting improvements in many categories,  in particular
Sport Performance basketball and Sport Heritage products. 
As a result of the strong product pipeline outlined above,  our
excellent order book and vigorous growth expectations for
our own-retail activities,  we expect mid- to high-single-digit
currency-neutral sales growth for adidas in 2005. 

Salomon Brings Major Innovation to Both Summer and
Winter Categories
The major top-line initiative at Salomon this year will focus
efforts to increase our presence in the women's athletic
market.  With our 'Women Will" campaign,  we will dramatically increase our women-specific product offering and
communication.  We expect this to impact sales in the soft
and hard goods categories.  Sales growth is also expected in
the cycling components category.  In the winter businesswe will be releasing two major ski system innovations.  The
Scrambler™ Hot and Crossmax® V12 will help drive improving
sales in the alpine category.  Because of the strong seasonality
of Salomon's business and the often short-term nature of
orders within the winter sports industry,  we do not provide
backlog information for the Salomon family of brands.  Nevertheless,  initial feedback from retailers suggests that Salomon
currency-neutral sales are likely to grow at mid-single-digit
rates in 2005. 

New Irons to be Launched at TaylorMade-adidas Golf 
Development of adidas Currency-Neutral Order Backlogs 1) in %

At TaylorMade-adidas Golf,  we are introducing the next
generation of rac™ irons to the market in 2005,  including the
OS,  LT and TP Forged.  This is the second largest golf hardware category and one that we aspire to lead within the
next three years.  New product extensions are planned in the
all-important metalwood category and our Clima® concept
will be extended in both the footwear and apparel categories. 
We will also introduce Maxfli's new BlackMAX® golf ball. 
Because backlogs are measured differently in golf than in
other parts of our business,  we do not provide order information for TaylorMade-adidas Golf.  However,  based on trade
show performance and ongoing dialog with customers,  we
are confident that TaylorMade-adidas Golf sales will grow at
mid-single-digit rates on a currency-neutral basis in 2005.

Continued Strength Expected in Europe 
Sales Acceleration Targeted in Asia in 2005 and Beyond 
On a regional basis,  we will further grow our top-line momentum in Europe,  our largest and most profitable region.  Major
growth engines will continue to be Eastern Europe,  in particular Russia,  as well as the UK and Iberia.  Backlog development
for the region was unchanged at year-end versus the prior
year.  This,  however,  masks an underlying improvement as a
result of the growing significance of at-once business and
increasing own-retail activities in the region.  Further,  orders
face a tough comparison with the prior year as a result of the
European Football Championships,  which drove particularly
strong sales growth in our football business during the second quarter of 2004.  We do not anticipate much support from
 macroeconomic perspective in 2005.  However,  we believe
that the events preceding the adidas sponsored 2006 FIFA
World Cup™ in Germany are likely to encourage increased
adidas brand exposure and sales in Europe during the second
half of the year.  Further,  our successful 'Winning in Europe"
program (see The Group/Group Strategy) continues to drive
overproportionate top-line growth at key accounts and own
retail,  in addition to generating bottom-line improvements
of approximately € 70 million between 2003 and 2006.  We
expect accelerated sales growth for both Salomon and
TaylorMade-adidas Golf in the region.  As a result,  we project
currency-neutral sales in Europe to grow at a mid-single-digit
rate in the region in 2005. 

adidas-Salomon is targeting significant sales growth in Asia in
the coming years.  As part of our 'Vision Asia" program,  we
plan to double the region's 2004 sales level by 2008.  The
major growth driver of this development will be China,  where
we plan to increase sales from currently well over € 100 million to € 1 billion by 2010.  This will be helped by our sponsorship of the Beijing 2008 Olympics and the country's most
important sports symbol,  the national football team.  Furthermore,  our growth expectations in Asia will also be supported
by double-digit annual increases in most major markets,  in
particular Japan,  Korea and Southeast Asia.  At year-endadidas currency-neutral backlogs for the region increased
44%,  underpinned by increases in most major markets. 
Strong growth in Asia is also expected at Salomon and
TaylorMade-adidas Golf.  Positive macroeconomic signals in
China and several other markets should also support sporting
goods growth in 2005.  As a result,  double-digit currencyneutral sales increases are expected in Asia for the year. 

Extending Turnaround in North America Remains
Key Priority
Our turnaround of the adidas business in North America
continues to be a top priority.  Improving relationships with
retail partners,  continued fine-tuning of our distribution
strategy,  and increasing the own-retail presence of brand
adidas will be the pillars of this strategic initiative.  At yearend,  backlogs in the region increased 7% on a currencyneutral basis,  supported by growth in both footwear and
apparel.  Although slower than adidas,  North American
currency-neutral sales will also grow for Salomon and
TaylorMade-adidas Golf.  This development,  coupled with the
improving sporting goods sector outlook in the USA,  is
expected to drive mid- to high-single-digit currency-neutral
sales growth for the Group in the region in 2005.

by new product and marketing initiatives as well as sourcing
and distribution optimization.  Although we do not have
formalized adidas backlog figures for this region,  customer
feedback at year-end points to strong growth in 2005. 
Salomon and TaylorMade-adidas Golf are also expected to
grow vigorously,  albeit from a small base.  Largely positive
macroeconomic development in the region will also support
growth expectations at all brands.  As a result,  Latin American
sales are expected to increase at high-single-digit rates on
 currency-neutral basis in 2005.

Outlook

Group Gross Margin Remains at High Level 
Record Operating Margin Targeted 
We are committed to being among the industry leaders in all
measures of profitability.  And as a result of these regional
developments,  we expect adidas-Salomon to again deliver
visible profitability improvements in 2005.  The increased
proportion of own-retail activities,  our improving product mix
and lower clearance sales will continue to be important
factors supporting our high gross margin.  We anticipate that
the stronger euro will continue to positively impact sourcing
costs and therefore further support gross margin strengthalbeit at a lower level than in 2004.  As a consequence,  we
are confident that the Group's gross margin will exceed our
medium-term targeted corridor of between 45 and 46%. 

Despite increased costs associated with the accelerated
expansion of adidas own-retail activities,  we expect continued
savings in operating overheads to provide leverage within our
operating expenses.  Consequently,  we are also projecting
further operating margin expansion,  which is our most important internal measure of operational success.  In 1997,  the
Group achieved an operating margin of 92%,  never reached
again since.  In 2005,  we will surpass this barrier on our way
to achieving a 10% operating margin in 2006. 

Own-Retail Activities Expected to Drive Personnel
Increases
In 2005,  we expect personnel to grow modestly at a level very
comparable to that of the prior year.  Own retail is again
expected to be the major area of increased personnel.  Personnel expenses (including production) are expected to grow
in line with the number of newly hired employees. 

R&D Spending to Remain Focused on Technological
Innovations
In 2005,  adidas-Salomon will continue to spend around
€ 90 million on research and development associated with
new products.  Areas of particular focus include runningbasketball and football at brand adidas,  as well as winter
sports and golf hardware at Salomon and TaylorMade-adidas
Golf respectively.  Design-related expenses,  which are separate from but often tightly integrated with research and
development spend,  will also remain at a similar level versus
the prior year.  The number of employees working in R&Dproduct development and supporting functions will remain
relatively stable at approximately 1000 in 2005. 

112

Profitability to Improve at adidas and TaylorMadeadidas Golf
In 2005,  we expect profitability to increase at both adidas and
TaylorMade-adidas Golf as a result of stable to slightly
improving gross margins as well as lower operating expenses
as a percentage of net sales.  At Salomon,  gross margin is
likely to remain under pressure due to the brand's Europeandominated sourcing structure.  Profitability,  however,  should
also improve. 

Net Income to Again Grow at Double-Digit Rates
We expect overproportionate growth in net earnings for the
fifth consecutive year.  The combination of top-line improvement,  a high gross margin and an improving operating margin
will help us achieve comparable earnings growth of between
10 and 15% versus the 2004 level of € 314 million. 

Key Profit and Loss Targets for 2005

Net income growth 
> 460%
> 92%

Increased Dividend Payout Ratio Going Forward
The Group has decided to extend its recommended long-termearnings-linked dividend payout ratio corridor from its longstanding 15 to 20% of net income to 15 to 25%,  reflecting
significant improvements we have made to the Group's financial health over the last few years.  As a result,  we expect to
increase our absolute dividend again for 2005. 

Investment Level in 2005 between € 200 Million and
€ 250 Million
Capital expenditure for the Group is expected to be at a level
of between € 200 million and € 250 million in 2005.  Investments in tangible and intangible assets will be used primarily
for own-retail expansion as well as for the increased deployment of SAP and other IT systems in major subsidiaries
within the Group.  The most important factors in determining
the exact level and timing of this investment will be the rate at
which we are able to successfully secure retail locations and
integrate new SAP systems within existing applications. 

Share Buyback Program to be Initiated
We are committed to continually improving the Group's financial structure and optimizing net debt levels.  In 2005,  we will
again practice tight working capital management with particular attention focused on improving the aging of our accounts
receivable.  Further,  as a result of our strong progress in 2004
and over the last several years (see Group Management
Report/Finance and Investment),  we will initiate a share
buyback program targeted at purchasing up to 10% of our
outstanding shares. 

Continued Supply Chain Improvements in Global
Operations
The manufacture of adidas-Salomon products is secured
through numerous independent manufacturers around the
world.  The supply levels and prices for adidas-Salomon
products are negotiated approximately six months in advance. 
As a result,  product sourcing costs are fairly predictable for
the next 12 months.  In 2005,  we will continue to negotiate for
lower purchasing costs.  Our top priority will focus on further
improving our apparel delivery performance.  We will also
continue to make improvements in our supply base,  increase
both lean management initiatives and investment in cuttingedge technologies as well as strengthen our quality programs.  In addition,  we will closely monitor any developments
in the sourcing market to optimize our sourcing structure and
benefit from the recent quota removal. 

Executive Board Change
Executive Board member Michel Perraudin has announced
his departure from the Executive Board of adidas-Salomon AG
at the end of March 2005.  He will leave the Group to allocate
more time to his new responsibility as President of the World
Federation of the Sporting Goods Industry (WFSGI).  His
responsibilities (Human Resources,  Key Projects and Corporate Services) will be assumed by Executive Board members
Herbert Hainer and Robin Stalker as well as General Counsel
Frank Dassler.  Michel Perraudin will continue to support the
Group on a consultancy basis.

Corporate Governance 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW

Improving Participation at Our Annual General Meeting 
Ensuring responsible and value-oriented corporate management is a major focus of our corporate culture and embraces
all areas of our Group.  In 2004,  we continued to strengthen
our corporate governance activities with a focus on enhancing
shareholders' rights.  The election of a new Supervisory Board
was one of the most significant events of 2004 in terms of
corporate governance.  The following section summarizes the
Group's activities concerning corporate governance with
special emphasis on the remuneration structure of both the
Supervisory Board and the Executive Board.  It also includes
our Declaration of Compliance 2005 with the German Corporate Governance Code as well as an outline of which additional recommendations we intend to follow in 2005. 

The Annual General Meeting (AGM) is the most important
platform for shareholders to exercise their formal rights. 
However,  due to the very broad and international nature of
our shareholders and the amount of time involved for some
foreign investors to access all information related to the AGMthe voting rate at our AGM has been below our expectations in
the past.  In 2004,  we concentrated our efforts on promoting
AGM participation.  We again offered a video transmission of
the AGM in its entirety in German and English on the corporate website.  The transmission included not only the prepared
Management comments but also the following discussion
between our shareholders and the Management.  We also
made it possible for those shareholders who were not able to
attend the meeting in person to give their voting rights to
proxies appointed by adidas-Salomon.  This could be done in
writing or via the Internet until the end of the AGM general
debate.  Our efforts paid off as we were able to improve the
voting rate by 7 percentage points to 28%.  However,  we
remain determined to increase the participation in our AGM
even further over the next few years and this will continue to
be a priority in 2005.  All documents related to this corporate
event and more information about participation and voting at
the AGM are available on a dedicated section of our website or
can be obtained from our Investor Relations Department.  The
next AGM will take place on May 4,  2005,  in Fürth,  Germany. 

Enhancing Shareholders' Rights
It is extremely important to us that our shareholders actively
participate in the activities of adidas-Salomon.  With this in
mind,  we put a high priority on providing relevant information
and on enhancing transparency.  Through extensive investor
relations work,  we strive to keep our shareholders regularly
informed about the latest financial and strategic development
of our Group.

Supervisory Board Responsibilities and Election 2004

Supervisory Board Remuneration in 2004

The Supervisory Board advises and supervises the Executive
Board in the management of the Group.  It is involved in all
decisions of fundamental importance to the Group.  It appoints
and dismisses members of the Executive Board.  In order to
increase the efficiency of its work and better address complex
issues,  the Supervisory Board of adidas-Salomon AG has
established several committees.  Specific information on the
activities of these committees in 2004 is provided in the
Supervisory Board Report.  One of the most significant events
of 2004 in terms of corporate governance at adidas-Salomon
was the election of the new Supervisory Board.  Pursuant to
the German Co-Determination Act,  our Supervisory Board
consists of an equal number of shareholders' representatives
and employees' representatives.  Whereas employees elected
their six representatives at the end of March,  the election of
the shareholders' representatives took place at the AGM on
May 13.  Through their diverse professional backgrounds and
nationalities,  the new members,  elected for five years,  mirror
the international nature and represent the broad scope of
activities of our Group.  More information about the members
of the Supervisory Board is contained in the Supervisory
Board overview. 

The currently valid remuneration of the individual Supervisory
Board members was resolved upon by the Annual General
Meeting on May 8,  2003 and is contained in § 18 of the adidasSalomon Articles of Association.  The Chairman receives a
fixed annual compensation of € 42000,  and the two Deputy
Chairmen each receive compensation in the amount of
€ 31500.  All other Supervisory Board members receive fixed
annual compensation in the amount of € 21000.  Out-ofpocket expenses associated with participation at Supervisory
Board meetings are refunded to all Supervisory Board members.  The total compensation paid to members of the Supervisory Board in 2004 was € 301000.  The members who left
the Supervisory Board following the elections in March and
on the date of the Annual General Meeting each received
compensation for five months,  amounting to € 8750.  Newly
elected members each received compensation for eight
months,  amounting to € 14000.  To ensure the independent
supervision required,  our Board members only receive fixed
compensation that is not linked to the Group's financial
performance.  Further,  no additional compensation is paid
for chairmanship or membership of Supervisory Board committees as we do not believe that additional compensation
would further improve the commitment to committee work. 
In addition,  we consider it to be a good compromise between
ensuring transparency and respecting individual privacy to
state the aggregate payments made for advisory and consultancy work as well as the number of members rendering such
work.  In 2004,  two Supervisory Board members received a
total of € 544039 for advisory services.  No members of the
Supervisory Board were granted loans by adidas-Salomon
in 2004. 

Changes on the Executive Board
The Executive Board is the managing body of adidas-Salomon. 
There was one change in the composition of the Executive
Board in 2004: Manfred Ihle,  who had been the Executive
Board member responsible for Legal and Environmental Affairs
since July 1998,  retired at the end of June 2004.  The Global
Legal Department is now headed by General Counsel Frank
Dassler who is also responsible for Social and Environmental
Affairs,  reporting to CEO Herbert Hainer.

Close and Constructive Cooperation between Both Boards
An important component of good corporate governance is
open dialog and constant cooperation between the Executive
and the Supervisory Boards.  By tradition,  our Boards have
had a constructive and efficient working relationship.  This
collaboration,  among other things,  is set out in the Rules of
Procedure for both Boards.

Structure of Executive Board Remuneration
In accordance with its Rules of Procedure,  our Supervisory
Board has assigned matters relating to the compensation
structure of the Executive Board to its General Committee.  As
this system has proven successful,  the General Committee
that also deals in detail with the performance of the Executive
Board members will continue to discuss and resolve upon
the structure of compensation of the Executive Board.  The
compensation structure is based on the Group's economic
and financial position and the outlook of the Group.  Criteria
for determining the level of Executive Board compensation
include the responsibilities and the contribution of the
respective Board member,  his personal performance as well
as the performance of the entire Executive Board.  The remuneration of the members of the Executive Board comprises
the following components:
> A fixed component which is paid monthly. 
> A variable component in the form of a performance bonuswhich is paid out following the end of the year and is
dependent on individual performance and the Group's
results.  The variable component also comprises a further
bonus under a Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP),  the
amount being linked to the attainment of certain goals
during a three-year period.  This bonus is dependent on the
accumulated earnings improvement (income before taxes)
in the period 2003 to 2005 and the earnings increase in
2005 versus the prior year.  Provided the targets are
achieved,  payment will be made following approval of the
consolidated financial statements for the year ending
December 31,  2005.  The allocation to the accrued expenses
is shown as variable remuneration. 
> Benefits in kind,  such as a company car,  etc. 
> Stock options,  which were granted under the Management
Share Option Plan (MSOP) adopted by the Annual General
Meeting on May 20,  1999 and amended by resolution of the
Annual General Meeting on May 8,  2002 and May 13,  2004as a compensation component with a long-term incentive
effect and with risk character. 
According to a resolution passed at the Annual General
Meeting in 1999,  a maximum of approximately 10% of
the total issue volume was granted to Executive Board 
116

members.  The stock options were given out in tranches
and are exercisable over five years following a two-year
vesting period,  provided that at least one of the following
performance objectives has been attained:
> During the period between the issue and exercise of the
stock options,  the stock market price for the adidasSalomon share has increased by an average annual rate
of at least 8% ('absolute performance"). 
> Between the issue and exercise of the stock options,  the
stock market price for the adidas-Salomon share has
grown by an annual average of 1% more favorably than
the stock market prices of the major competitors of
adidas-Salomon globally and in absolute terms has not
fallen ('relative performance"). 
Compensation from the stock option plan consists of a
performance discount which is composed of the absolute
and relative performance components. 
The variable components are structured in such a way as to
represent a clear incentive to achieve the defined goals. 

Executive Board Remuneration in 2004
The compensation of the Executive Board,  which we report in
total as we believe that a disclosure of the individual compensation does not provide relevant additional information for the
capital markets,  amounted to € 15 million in 2004.  The number of outstanding stock options held by current members of
the Executive Board as at December 31,  2004 totaled 53000
options.  77600 options were exercised in 2004 by the current
members of the Executive Board and the retiring member. 
Due to the fact that all stock options available under the
Management Share Option Plan have been distributed,  no
further stock options were granted to the Executive Board in
2004.  As all stock options were granted prior to the amendments made to the Code in May 2003,  a possibility of limitation (cap) for extraordinary,  unforeseen developments does
not exist.  In addition,  we believe that the Management Share
Option Plan features such challenging exercise hurdles that a
limitation is unnecessary.  No members of the Executive Board
were granted loans by adidas-Salomon in 2004.

Pension Commitments
adidas-Salomon has made provision for pension obligations
regarding members of the Executive Board in the amount of
€ 7 million.  Pension provisions for pension obligations
regarding former members of the Executive Board amounted
to € 33 million.  In 2004,  pension payments to former members of the Executive Board and their surviving dependants
totaled € 1 million. 

Directors' Dealings
Pursuant to § 15a of the German Securities Trading Act
(Wertpapierhandelsgesetz WpHG) amended as at October
30,  2004,  we publish the sale or purchase of adidas-Salomon
shares by members of our Executive or Supervisory Board
as well as by key executives on our corporate website in the
event that such transactions reach in total € 5000 for any one
member and any person in close relationship with him/her
within a fiscal year.  Prior to October 30,  2004 there was no
notification requirement if the shares or stock options were
purchased based on the terms of the relevant employment
contract or if the total value of the transactions did not exceed
€ 25000 within 30 days. 
In 2004,  we published the details of the following
transactions:
In the course of 2004,  Charles Thomas Scott,  a member
of the Supervisory Board until May 2004,  sold 2000 shares
and Christian Tourres,  a current member of the Supervisory
Board,  sold a total of 200000 shares and purchased a total
of 40000 shares.  Christian Ruprecht,  the son of a member of
the Supervisory Board,  and Jean-Luc Diard,  President of
Salomon,  sold 130 and 125 shares respectively.  In additionJean-Luc Diard,  Christophe Bézu,  Head of adidas Asia/Pacificand Michel Perraudin,  a member of adidas-Salomon's
Executive Board,  exercised stock options related to adidasSalomon's Management Share Option Plan (MSOP),  selling
500,  2000 and 2400 shares respectively.  No other transactions subject to the reporting obligation in accordance with
§ 15a of the German Securities Trading Act were reported
in 2004. 

Declaration of Compliance 2005
The Executive Board and the Supervisory Board of adidasSalomon AG issued last year's Declaration of Compliance in
accordance with § 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act
(Aktiengesetz AktG) on February 10,  2004.  As of February
11,  2004,  adidas-Salomon AG has complied with all recommendations of the Government Commission German Corpo
rate Governance Code (Regierungskommission Deutscher
Corporate Governance Kodex) (as resolved on May 21,  2003)
with the exceptions stated in the following:
> adidas-Salomon's D&O liability insurance does not include
 deductible for Executive Board and Supervisory Board
members (Article 38). 1)
> Compensation of Executive Board members is reported in
total (Article 424). 
> Stock options granted to Executive Board members in
connection with the Management Share Option Plan (MSOP)
do not provide a possibility of limitation (cap) for extraordinary,  unforeseeable developments.  The compensation
report does not include information on the value of stock
options (Article 423). 
> adidas-Salomon does not specify age limits for Supervisory
Board members (Article 541). 1)
> The compensation of the Supervisory Board members
consists only of a fixed compensation component and does
not consider the membership in Supervisory Board committees. 1) Compensation paid to the members of the
Supervisory Board for advisory or agency services rendered is reported in total (Article 545). 
> The structure of the Executive Board compensation system
is reviewed and determined by the General Committee
(Article 422). 1)
> The shareholdings of individual Executive Board and
Supervisory Board members are reported if these
directly or indirectly exceed 5% of the shares issued by
adidas-Salomon AG.  The entire holdings are reported
separately according to Executive Board and Supervisory
Board if the entire holdings of all Executive Board and
Supervisory Board members exceed 5% of the shares
issued by the Company,  provided adidas-Salomon AG has
received the according notifications (Article 66). 1)
In future,  adidas-Salomon AG will comply with the recommendations of the Government Commission German Corporate
Governance Code in its version of May 21,  2003 with the
exceptions marked with 1).  The compensation for Executive
Board members will be reported on an individual basis for the
fiscal year 2005.  Future stock option plans will provide a
possibility of limitation (cap) for extraordinary,  unforeseeable
developments.  Compensation paid to members of the Supervisory Board for advisory or agency services rendered will be
reported individually for the fiscal year 2005. 
1) Remaining 
Outlook 2005
We believe that establishing good corporate governance is not
 one-time action.  On the contrary,  it evolves constantly over
time and in response to new regulations,  standards and
market conditions.  At adidas-Salomon,  we are committed to
continuously developing and improving our corporate governance principles.  With this in mind,  our Corporate Governance
Officer monitors the latest developments in and outside
Germany and regularly reports to the Executive and Supervisory Boards.  These two bodies,  which hold joint final responsibility for the active implementation of good corporate governance throughout the Company,  reviewed our Corporate
Governance Principles and reconsidered the Group's current
deviations from the German Corporate Governance Code.  As
mentioned in the Declaration of Compliance above,  the
Boards of adidas-Salomon intend to comply with certain
additional recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code starting in 2005.  Nevertheless,  in 2005 adidasSalomon will maintain some of the exceptions reported in the
Declaration of Compliance of February 2005 as we believe
that some recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code are inappropriate for our Group.  For instancewe will not adopt an age limit for Supervisory Board members
as we believe it would narrow the rights of the shareholders
to elect their representatives to the Supervisory Board.  Additionally,  we do not regard D&O liability insurance with a
deductible for Board members,  which is not common outside
Germany,  as appropriate since adidas-Salomon senior
managers,  both in and outside Germany,  are covered by a
group insurance policy.  Nor does it seem appropriate to
differentiate between Board members and other high-level
personnel.

Supervisory Board Report 
Dear Shareholders
Main Topics Covered by the Supervisory Board 
In the year under review,  we performed our tasks as defined
by German law and the Articles of Association.  We regularly
advised the Executive Board and monitored the Group's
management.  The Executive Board kept us regularly informed
about the position of the Group,  corporate policy and matters
relating to major business transactions by means of detailed
verbal and written reports.  We were directly involved in all
decisions of fundamental importance. 
In 2004,  five joint meetings of the Supervisory Board and
the Executive Board and one constituent meeting of the newly
elected Supervisory Board took place.  The external auditor
KPMG Deutsche Treuhand-Gesellschaft Aktiengesellschaft
Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft,  Frankfurt am Main
('KPMG") attended the annual financial statements meeting
and the meetings where the quarterly financial statements
were presented.  At four of the six Supervisory Board meetings
in 2004,  the meeting attendance rate of the Supervisory Board
members was 100%.  One Supervisory Board member was
unable to attend two of the Supervisory Board meetings due
to urgent business commitments elsewhere.  The Supervisory
Board approved urgent transactions in two resolutions by way
of circular vote.  Furthermore,  as Chairman of the Supervisory
Board,  I also maintained regular contact with the Executive
Board between the Supervisory Board meetings and was kept
well informed about the current business situation and major
business transactions. 

The development of sales and earnings of the adidas-Salomon
Group and the individual operational units and the Group's
financial position was the subject of regular consultations
within the Supervisory Board.  At the beginning of the yearwe approved the annual budget and investment plan for the
adidas-Salomon Group for 2004.  In this context,  we also
discussed in depth the development and future business
strategy of the adidas operational unit in North America. 
Furthermore,  we amended the Rules of Procedure of the
Supervisory Board to the effect that the General Committee is
now comprised of an equal number of representatives of the
shareholders and the employees.  The related supplementary
election was conducted.  In March,  the main focus of our
consultations was the financial statements and consolidated
financial statements for the year ending December 31,  2004and the proposed resolutions to be put to the Annual General
Meeting.  At the meeting in May,  we discussed the results for
the first quarter and reviewed progress of the 'Winning in
Europe" program which aims to achieve significant cost
savings as well as both sales and earnings growth.  In Augustwe focused on the financial statements for the first half year. 
The Executive Board reported to us in detail about business
development of the adidas brand and its positioning in Europe
and North America.  At our meeting in November,  the Executive Board informed us in detail about business development
of the adidas brand in Asia and Latin America,  as well as the
'Vision Asia" and 'Latin Conquest" projects aimed at driving
substantial sales and earnings growth.  At this meeting,  we
also approved the annual budget and investment plan for the
adidas-Salomon Group for 2005. 

Committee Activities
In the year under review,  the Supervisory Board had three
standing committees.  The members of the respective committees are shown in the Supervisory Board overview. 
The General Committee dealt with personnel matters
related to the Executive Board,  including the compensation
system and the Long-Term Incentive Plan,  on six occasions
in 2004. 
The Audit Committee met three times in the year under
review.  The members discussed in detail the financial statements and consolidated financial statements for 2003,  dealt
with the quarterly reports for 2004 in depth and gave extensive
consideration to exchange rate impacts on sales and earnings. 

118

The Audit Committee also defined the audit priorities and
discussed the fee to be arranged with the auditor.  The Group's
external auditor attended all meetings,  reporting in detail
on the audit of the financial statements and consolidated
financial statements,  and was also available to answer questions.  The entire Supervisory Board was always informed in
detail about the matters discussed at the meetings of the
Audit Committee. 
The Mediation Committee,  formed in accordance with
§ 27 section 3 of the German Co-Determination Act (MitbestG)submits proposals to the Supervisory Board regarding the
appointment or dismissal of Executive Board members if the
two-thirds Supervisory Board majority necessary for an
appointment/dismissal is not achieved.  This committee again
had no occasion to meet in 2004. 
The Supervisory Board Committee 'Convertible Bond/Bond
with Warrants",  set up in August 2003 for a limited period of
time,  was dissolved upon expiry of the term of office of its
members,  i, e.  at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting on May 13,  2004. 

Examination of the 2004 Financial Statements and
Consolidated Financial Statements
KPMG Deutsche Treuhand-Gesellschaft Aktiengesellschaft
Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft,  Frankfurt am Main,  audited
the financial statements of adidas-Salomon AG for the year
under review as prepared by the Executive Board in line with
the provisions of the German Commercial Code (HGB) as well
as the management report.  The auditor issued an unqualified
opinion thereon. 
As in the previous year,  the consolidated financial statements were prepared in compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).  Under the provisions of
§ 292a HGB,  these financial statements exempt the Group
from drawing up consolidated financial statements in accordance with German Commercial Law.  The auditor issued an
unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements
and the Group Management Report. 

The auditor's reports and the closing documents were
sent to all members of the Supervisory Board in a timely
manner.  They were examined in detail first at the meeting of
the Audit Committee on March 2,  2005 and subsequently at
the annual financial statements meeting of the Supervisory
Board on March 3,  2005.  During this meeting,  the Chairman of
the Audit Committee,  Dr.  Hans Friderichs,  also reported to the
Supervisory Board in detail on the scope and priorities of the
audit.  The auditor was present at the financial statements and
consolidated financial statements discussions of the Audit
Committee and the Supervisory Board.  He reported on the
material results of the audit and was available for the provision of supplementary information. 
Having ourselves examined the financial statements of
adidas-Salomon AG,  the consolidated financial statementsthe management reports and the proposal put forward by the
Executive Board regarding the appropriation of retained
earnings,  we approved the results of the audit,  following the
recommendation of the Audit Committee,  and we approved
and thereby adopted the financial statements,  the consolidated financial statements and the management reports at
our meeting on March 3,  2005.  We also agreed with the
proposal put forward by the Executive Board regarding the
appropriation of retained earnings. 

Changes on the Executive Board 
Composition of the Supervisory Board 
We appreciate the tremendous work of the Executive Boardthe Management Boards of the Group companies,  the Works
Council and all adidas-Salomon employees.  We thank all of
them for their ongoing commitment. 

In the year under review,  there were changes on the Supervisory Board.  On March 30 and 31,  2004,  the employees
elected Sabine Bauer,  Fritz Kammerer,  Roland Nosko,  Hans
Ruprecht,  Heidi Thaler-Veh and Klaus Weiß as employee
representatives to the Supervisory Board.  At the Annual
General Meeting on May 13,  2004,  the shareholders elected
Henri Filho,  Dr.  Hans Friderichs,  Dr.  iur.  Manfred Gentz,  Igor
Landau,  Christian Tourres and Willi Schwerdtle as members
of the Supervisory Board.  At the constituent meeting of the
Supervisory Board,  the Chairman of the Supervisory Board
and the two Deputy Chairmen were elected.  Further,  the
committees (General Committee,  Audit Committee and
Mediation Committee) were established.  The terms of office
of Gerold Brandt,  David Bromilow,  Herbert Müller and
Charles Thomas Scott ended at the conclusion of the Annual
General Meeting.  On behalf of the Supervisory Board,  I wish
to thank them for their constructive contributions to the
Board and for their commitment to the benefit of the Group. 

Manfred Ihle,  member of the Executive Board and responsible
for Legal and Environmental Affairs,  left the Group upon the
expiry of his appointment on June 30,  2004 to begin retirement.  We wish to thank Manfred Ihle for his personal dedication and the commitment with which he performed his tasks. 

Corporate Governance
The Executive Board also reports on behalf of the Supervisory
Board on corporate governance at adidas-Salomon AG in the
Corporate Governance Overview.  On February 9,  2005,  the
Executive Board and the Supervisory Board presented an updated Declaration of Compliance in accordance with § 161 AktG
(German Stock Corporation Act),  which was made permanently
available to the shareholders of adidas-Salomon AG on the
corporate website. 

Outlook
The 2004 results confirm adidas-Salomon's strong performance,  by meeting or exceeding all our major financial targets. 
Additionally,  the results stated in this annual report illustrate
notable operational improvements.  We are confident that the
Group will continue to succeed in meeting its established
targets in the future.

Executive Board Statement
The Executive Board of adidas-Salomon AG is responsible for the compilation,  completeness and
accuracy of the Group's annual consolidated financial statements,  the description of the economic
development and the Group Management Report as well as the other information presented in
the annual report.  The consolidated financial statements 2004 were prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) adopted by the International Accounting
Standards Board (IASB).  The consolidated financial statements also comply with § 292a German
Commercial Code (HGB),  which exempts adidas-Salomon AG from the obligation of reporting
consolidated financial statements under German GAAP.  The Group Management Report additionally
complies with the requirements of the German Commercial Code (HGB). 
To ensure accuracy and reliability of the underlying information,  the content of the consolidated
financial statements is based on the information reported in accordance with Group-wide guidelines
which are consistent for all companies included in consolidation.  The integrity of the reporting
process and risk management systems is safeguarded by internal control systems established under
the direction of the Executive Board which is in compliance with the German Act regarding the
Control and Transparency of Company Divisions (KonTraG).  These control systems form an essential
part of our value-oriented management style.  As a consequence,  a true and fair view of the Group's
financial position,  results of operations and cash flows and its reporting thereon is assured and the
Executive Board is in a position to recognize potential investment risks and negative developments at
an early stage and take appropriate countermeasures. 
In accordance with a resolution adopted by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in
2004,  KPMG Deutsche Treuhand-Gesellschaft Aktiengesellschaft WirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaftFrankfurt am Main,  was appointed by the Supervisory Board as independent auditor to audit adidasSalomon's consolidated financial statements and Group Management Report contained in this annual
report.  The Supervisory Board examines the consolidated financial statements,  the Group Management Report as well as the audit report at its meeting on the annual consolidated financial statements.  The results of these reviews are described in the Supervisory Board Report.

Independent Auditor's Report
We have audited the consolidated financial statements,  comprising the consolidated balance sheetthe consolidated income statement and the notes to the consolidated financial statements and the
statements of changes in shareholders' equity as well as cash flows prepared by adidas-Salomon AGHerzogenaurach,  for the business year from January 1 to December 31,  2004.  The preparation and
the content of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) are the responsibility of the Company's Management.  Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with German
auditing regulations and German generally accepted standards for the audit of financial statements
promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW).  Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit such that it can be assessed with reasonable assurance whether the consolidated
financial statements are free of material misstatements.  Knowledge of the business activities and
the economic and legal environment of the Group and evaluations of possible misstatements are
taken into account in the determination of audit procedures.  The evidence supporting the amounts
and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements is examined on a test basis within the
framework of the audit.  The audit includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by Management,  as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated
financial statements.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In our opinion,  the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the net assetsfinancial position,  results of operations and cash flows of the adidas-Salomon Group for the business
year in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. 
Our audit,  which also extends to the Group Management Report prepared by the Company's
Management for the business year from January 1 to December 31,  2004,  has not led to any
reservations.  In our opinion on the whole the Group Management Report provides a suitable understanding of the Group's position and suitably presents the risks of future development.  In additionwe confirm that the consolidated financial statements and the Group Management Report for the
business year from January 1 to December 31,  2004 satisfy the conditions required for the
Company's exemption from its duty to prepare consolidated financial statements and the Group
Management Report in accordance with German law.

NOTES

 /// Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
adidas-Salomon AG,  a listed German stock corporation,  and its subsidiaries design,  develop,  produce and market a broad range of athletic and sports lifestyle products.  The Group's headquarters
are located in Herzogenaurach,  Germany.  adidas-Salomon has divided its operating activities by
major brands into three segments: adidas,  Salomon and TaylorMade-adidas Golf. 
adidas branded products include footwear,  apparel and hardware,  such as bags and balls. 
The products are designed and developed by adidas and are almost exclusively manufactured by
subcontractors on behalf of adidas. 
Salomon branded products include ski and snowboard equipment (skis,  snowboards,  boots
and bindings),  technical outdoor apparel as well as hiking boots and inline skates which are
designed and manufactured mainly in France,  Italy and Romania.  Mavic products include rims and
wheels for mountain bikes and road racing as well as gears.  The Bonfire brand offers snowboard
apparel and streetwear.  Cliché is the brand for skateboard equipment and apparel.  Arc'Teryx is
specialized in technical outerwear,  performance backpacks and climbing equipment. 
TaylorMade develops and assembles or manufactures high-quality golf clubs,  balls and accessories.  adidas Golf branded products include footwear,  apparel and accessories.  Maxfli is specialized in golf balls and golf accessories. 

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the consolidation,  accounting and valuation principles described below. 
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of adidas-Salomon AG and its significant direct and indirect subsidiaries,  which are prepared in accordance with uniform accounting
principles. 
 company is a subsidiary if adidas-Salomon AG directly or indirectly controls the financial and
operating policies of the respective enterprise. 
The number of consolidated companies evolved as follows for the years ending December 312004 and 2003 respectively:

 /// General
The accompanying consolidated financial statements of adidas-Salomon AG (in the following also
the 'Company") and its subsidiaries (collectively the 'adidas-Salomon Group",  'adidas-Salomon"
or the 'Group") are prepared in accordance with accounting principles adopted by the International
Accounting Standards Board (International Financial Reporting Standards 'IFRS").  The Group
applied all International Financial Reporting Standards and Interpretations of the International
Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee effective as at December 31,  2004 and 2003
respectively. 
In 2004,  the new and revised standards IFRS 3 (issued 2004) 'Business Combinations",  IAS 36
(revised 2004) 'Impairment of Assets" and IAS 38 (revised 2004) 'Intangible Assets" were adopted
for all acquisitions on or after March 31,  2004.  The adoption of these standards in 2005 will impact
the Company's financial position significantly,  as scheduled goodwill amortization is no longer
allowed. 
As of January 1,  2005 the Company will adopt the revised IAS standards resulting from the
Improvement Project,  revised standard IAS 39 and new standard IFRS 2 'Share-Based Payment".  It
is believed that these standards will not have a material impact on the Company's financial positionresults of operations or cash flows. 
German Statutory Reporting
The Company does not prepare consolidated financial statements under accounting principles
generally accepted in Germany (German GAAP) pursuant to the exemption in § 292a of the German
Commercial Code (HGB).

Three subsidiaries have not been included in the consolidated financial statements in 2004
(2003: four subsidiaries),  since they have little or no active business and are insignificant to the
Group's financial position,  results of operations and cash flows.  The shares in these companies are
accounted at cost. 
 schedule of the shareholdings of adidas-Salomon AG is shown in Attachment I to these
notes.  A collective listing of these shareholdings in accordance with § 313 section 4 of the German
Commercial Code will be filed with the Commercial Register at the Local Court in Fürth (Bavaria). 
Consolidation of equity is made in compliance with the book value method by offsetting the
initial investments in subsidiaries against the relevant equity portion at fair value held by the parent
company as at acquisition date. 
All significant intercompany transactions and balances,  and any unrealized gains and losses
arising from intercompany transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial
statements. 

Currency Translation
Assets and liabilities of the Group's non-euro functional currency subsidiaries are translated into
euro at closing exchange rates at the balance sheet date.  Revenues and expenses are translated at
the average exchange rates for the year.  All cumulative differences from the translation of equity of
foreign subsidiaries resulting from changes in exchange rates are included in a separate item
within shareholders' equity without affecting income. 
In the individual financial statements of Group companies,  monetary items denominated in a
non-euro currency are generally measured at closing exchange rates at the balance sheet date.  The
resulting currency gains and losses are recorded directly in income. 
 summary of exchange rates to euro for major currencies in which the Group operates is as

Derivative Financial Instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments,  such as interest and currency options,  forward
contracts,  as well as interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge its
exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks.  In accordance with its treasury policy,  the
Group does not hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. 
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognized in the balance sheet at cost and
subsequently measured at their fair value.  The method of recognizing the resulting gain or loss is
dependent on the nature of the item being hedged.  On the date a derivative contract is entered intothe Group designates certain derivatives as either a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or
liability (fair value hedge),  a hedge of a forecasted transaction (cash flow hedge) or a hedge of a net
investment in a foreign entity. 
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedgesand that are 100% effective,  as defined in IAS 39,  are recognized in equity.  If the effectiveness is not
100%,  the deviating amounts are recognized in net income.  Amounts deferred in equity are transferred to the income statement in the same periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction
affects the income statement.  For derivative instruments designated as a fair value hedge,  the gain
or loss on the derivative and the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item are recognized immediately in net income. 

Certain derivative transactions,  while providing effective economic hedges under the Group's
risk management policies,  do not qualify for hedge accounting under the specific rules of IAS 39. 
Changes in the fair values of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting
under IAS 39 are recognized immediately in the income statement. 
Hedges of net investments in foreign entities are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. 
If the hedging instrument is a derivative (e.g.  a forward contract) or,  for example,  a foreign currency
borrowing,  any currency gains and losses in the derivative as well as all gains and losses arising on
the translation of the borrowing are recognized in equity. 
The Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items at the
inception of the transaction,  as well as the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking
various hedge transactions.  This process includes linking all derivatives designated as hedges to
specific forecasted transactions.  The Group also documents its assessment,  both at the hedge
inception and on an ongoing basis,  whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions
are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items. 
The fair values of forward contracts and currency options are determined on the basis of the
market conditions on the reporting dates.  The fair value of a currency option is determined using
generally accepted models to calculate option prices.  The fair market value of an option is influenced not only by the remaining term of the option but also by further determining factors,  such as
the actual foreign exchange rate and the volatility of the underlying foreign currency base.  The fair
values of interest rate options on the reporting date are assessed by the financial institutions
through which these options were arranged. 
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents represent cash and short-term bank deposits with maturities of three
months and less. 
Receivables
Receivables are stated at nominal amounts less allowances for doubtful accounts.  These
allowances are determined on the basis of individual risk assessment and past experience of
losses. 
Inventories
Merchandise and finished goods are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value.  Costs are
determined using a standard valuation method which approximates the first-in,  first-out method or
the average cost method.  Costs of finished goods include cost of raw materials,  direct labor and
manufacturing overheads.  The lower of cost or net realizable value allowances are computed
consistently throughout the Group based on the age and expected future sales of the items on hand. 

Financial Analysis
----------------------Consolidated Financial Statements (IFRS)
Notes
---135

Investment Property Held-for-Sale
Investment property held-for-sale is measured initially at cost.  For subsequent measurement,  the
Group applies the cost model. 
Property,  Plant and Equipment
Property,  plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.  Depreciation is
computed on a declining balance or straight-line basis on useful lives as follows:

Amortization is calculated on a straight-line basis with the following useful lives:
Useful Lives of Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets
Years
Goodwill 
Useful Lives of Property,  Plant and Equipment 
5–20

Patents,  trademarks and concessions 
5–10

Software 
3–5

Years
Buildings 
10–50

Leasehold improvements 
5–20

Equipment,  machinery and furniture and fittings 
2–10

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.  Significant renewals and
improvements are capitalized. 
Impairment
In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the costs of long-lived assets are impairedan evaluation of recoverability is performed.  An exceptional write-down is made if the carrying
amount exceeds the recoverable amount. 
Finance Leases
If under a lease agreement substantially all risks and rewards associated with an asset are transferred to the Group,  the asset less accumulated depreciation and the corresponding liability are
recognized at the fair value of the asset or the lower net present value of the minimum lease
payments. 
Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets
Acquired goodwill and intangible assets are valued at cost less accumulated impairment losses and
amortization respectively. 
Goodwill is the excess of the purchase cost over the fair value of the identifiable assets and
liabilities acquired.  Goodwill arising from the acquisition of a foreign entity and any fair value
adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities of that foreign entity are treated as
assets of the reporting entity and are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the date of the
initial consolidation. 

136

Expenditures for internally generated intangible assets are generally expensed as incurred
since they do not qualify for recognition. 
Goodwill arising from acquisitions before March 31,  2004 is amortized on a straight-line basis. 
Goodwill arising from acquisitions on or after March 31,  2004 is only tested annually for
impairment as the Group applied IFRS 3 in combination with IAS 36 (revised 2004) on these
acquisitions. 
Goodwill has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to six cash-generating units.  The
Group's cash-generating units are identified according to brand and region of operations in line with
the internal management approach.  adidas-Salomon has thus defined the four regions in the
adidas segment (adidas Region Europe,  North America,  Asia and Latin America) as well as the two
segments Salomon and TaylorMade-adidas Golf as the relevant cash-generating units. 
The segments Salomon and TaylorMade-adidas Golf acquired the remaining shares of
Salomon & Taylor Made Co.  Ltd.  (Japan),  adidas Region Europe acquired Maersk Ewals Logistics
B. V.,  adidas Region North America acquired Valley Apparel Company and adidas Region Asia
acquired the remaining shares of adidas Malaysia Sdn.  Bhd.  after March 30,  2004 (see also note 4). 
From January 1,  2005 scheduled amortization of goodwill is ceased and goodwill is tested
annually for impairment,  and additionally when there are indications of potential impairment. 

The carrying amounts of goodwill are allocated to the cash-generating units as follows:
Allocation of Goodwill € in millions

Total goodwill 
572

In 2004,  adidas-Salomon determined that there is no impairment of any of its cash-generating units containing goodwill with indefinite useful lives. 
The recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is determined on the basis of a fair value
less cost to sell calculation.  These calculations use cash flow projections based on the next year's
detailed financial budget and financial planning covering a five-year period in total.  Cash flows
beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using steady growth rates of around 2%.  The growth
rates do not exceed the long-term average growth rate of the business in which each of the cashgenerating unit operates. 
The discount rates are based on a weighted average cost of capital calculation considering the
debt/equity structure and financing costs of the major competitors of each cash-generating unit. 
The discount rates used are after-tax rates and reflect specific equity and country risk of the relevant cash-generating unit.  The applied discount rates for the specific cash-generating unit are
between 64% and 75%. 

Research and Development
Research costs are expensed as incurred.  Development costs are also expensed as incurred and
are not capitalized due to the short product life cycle of sporting goods. 
The Group spent approximately € 88 million and € 86 million on product research and
development for the years ending December 31,  2004 and 2003 respectively. 
Investments
All purchases and sales of investments are recognized on the trade date.  Costs of purchases
include transaction costs.  If the fair value of available-for-sale investments can be measured
reliably,  they are subsequently carried at fair value.  Realized and unrealized gains and losses
arising from changes in the fair value of these investments are included in the income statement of
the period in which they arise.  Equity securities for which fair values cannot be measured reliably
are recognized at cost less impairment. 
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognized initially at the loan amounts received,  net of transaction costs incurred. 
In subsequent periods,  long-term borrowings are stated at amortized cost using the effective
interest method.  Any difference between proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption
value is recognized in the income statement over the terms of the borrowings. 
The fair value of the liability component of the convertible bond is determined using a market
interest rate for a comparable straight bond; this amount is presented under long-term borrowings
on an amortized cost basis until conversion or maturity of the bond.  The remaining portion is
included in shareholders' equity; the value of the equity component is not changed in subsequent
periods. 
Other Liabilities
Other liabilities are recorded at their settlement amount. 
Provisions
Provisions are recognized where a present legal or constructive obligation has been incurred
which is likely to lead to an outflow of resources which can be reasonably estimated. 

Financial Analysis
----------------------Consolidated Financial Statements (IFRS)
Notes
---137

Pensions and Similar Obligations
Provisions for pensions and similar obligations comprise the provision obligation of the Group
under defined benefit and contribution plans.  The obligation under defined benefit plans is determined using the projected unit credit method in accordance with IAS 19 (revised 2000).  The Group
does not recognize actuarial gains or losses of defined benefit plans as income and expenses
according to the corridor approach of IAS 1992 (revised 2000) within the range of 10% of the
present value of the defined benefit obligation. 
Recognition of Revenues
Sales are recorded net of returns,  discounts,  allowances and sales taxes when title passes based
on the terms of the sale. 
Royalty and commission income is recorded based on the terms of the contracts. 
Advertising and Promotional Expenditures
Production costs for media campaigns are shown under prepaid expenses until the advertising
takes place for the first time,  after which they are expensed in full.  Significant media buying costs
(e.g.  broadcasting fees) are expensed over the original duration of the campaign on a straight-line
basis. 
Promotional expenses,  including one-time up-front payments for promotional contracts,  are
expensed pro rata over the term of the agreement. 
Interest
Interest is recognized as an expense or income as incurred. 
Income Taxes
Current income taxes are computed in accordance with the rules for taxation established in the
countries in which the Group operates. 
The Group computes deferred taxes for all temporary differences between the carrying
amount and the tax basis of its assets and liabilities and tax loss carryforwards. 
Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences and tax loss carryforwards
which exceed taxable temporary differences are only recognized to the extent that it is probable that
the company concerned will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the associated benefit. 
Equity Compensation Benefits
Stock options have been granted to members of the Executive Board of adidas-Salomon AG as well
as to the managing directors/senior vice presidents of its affiliated companies and to further
senior executives of the Group in connection with the Management Share Option Plan (MSOP) of
adidas-Salomon AG.  The Company has the choice to settle a possible obligation by issuing new
shares or providing the equivalent cash compensation.  When options are exercised and the Company decides to issue new shares,  the proceeds received net of any transaction costs are credited
to share capital and capital surplus,  and no personnel expenses are recorded.  In the case of a cash
settlement,  the difference between the exercise price and the fair value of the shares is debited to
income. 

138

Long-Term Incentive Plans
The Group has established various long-term incentive plans which offer key employees cash and
share-based compensation,  including stock appreciation rights ('SARs").  Compensation costs for
the difference between the exercise price and the fair value of the SARs are recognized in the
financial statements when the SARs are exercised. 
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of assumptions
and estimates that affect reported amounts and related disclosures.  Although such estimates are
based on Management's best knowledge of current events and actions,  actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates. 
 /// Framework for Accounting Policies in accordance with IFRS and Explanation of Major Differences compared with German Accounting Policies
The major differences between the accounting policies and consolidation methods according to
IFRS and German law as set out in § 292a section 2 No.  4b of the German Commercial Code (HGB)
are outlined below. 
a) Framework for Accounting Policies in Accordance with IFRS
The accounting policies of entities in accordance with IFRS are based on the objective of providing
investors with decision-relevant information. 
Based on the assumption that decision-relevant information should be provided to investors,  it
follows that accounting policies should be aimed at showing an entity's operating results,  rather
than determining the amount of distributable profits,  whilst bearing in mind the need for protection
of creditors. 
As a rule,  accounting policies in accordance with IFRS have a lower level of prudence than
German accounting policies,  which leads to the following major differences:
> Minimization of possibilities for establishing and releasing hidden reserves. 
> The consistency requirement (recognition,  valuation,  classification,  consolidation) is to be strictly
followed; changes in accounting policies are only permitted if it can be proven that the change
leads to an improvement in the fair presentation of the financial statements. 
> Economic substance has precedence over legal form.  The principle of substance over form has a
stronger influence in accounting policies in accordance with IFRS than in German GAAP. 

b) Description of Major Differences in Accounting Policies Compared with German Accounting
Policies
The major differences in accounting policies in accordance with IFRS compared with German
accounting policies in the consolidated financial statements of the Group are as follows:
Unrealized Profits Included in the Income Statement
Although the realization principle is a specific part of IFRS,  in contrast to German accounting
policies 'unrealized" profits must be included in the income statement in certain cases.  The following balance sheet items are translated at prevailing year-end foreign exchange rates even if this
leads to an 'unrealized" profit compared with using the exchange rate at the booking date:
> Foreign currency receivables and liabilities. 
> Derivative financial instruments to the extent they do not represent a hedge. 
> Available-for-sale securities. 
Deferred Taxes
Deferred tax assets must be included to their full extent.  This also applies to tax loss carryforwardswhich can be offset against future profits for tax purposes and which are thus to be reflected as
deferred tax assets.  Deferred tax assets are reviewed for their realization regularly and are written
down if appropriate. 
Goodwill
Goodwill arising from acquisitions after March 30,  2004 is only tested annually for impairment as
the Group applied IFRS 3 in combination with IAS 36 (revised 2004) on these acquisitions.  German
accounting policies require scheduled amortization. 
Pension Provisions
Pension provisions are calculated actuarially using the projected unit credit method.  Use of the
German tax-based entry-age-normal method (§ 6a German Income Tax Act EStG) is not
permitted. 
Expected wage and salary increases until pensionable age are considered when calculating
the pension liability to beneficiaries under the scheme.  Capital market interest rates are used to
discount the amounts.  These rates can differ significantly from the 6% used for tax purposes in
Germany (§ 6a EStG).  Pension provisions are calculated for beneficiaries as soon as they become
scheme members.  Appropriate fluctuation rates should be used when considering the provisions
needed for this group of beneficiaries. 
Other Provisions and Accruals
Provisions and accruals may only be set up to cover obligations to third parties.  Internal accruals
are not permitted. 

Accounting for Leases
In contrast to the use of German tax-based leasing provisions,  IFRS requirements more often lead
to leased items being recognized in the balance sheet of the lessee rather than of the lessor.  IFRS
requires the contractual party which is the economic owner and which thus has the major share of
risks and opportunities arising from the use of the item being leased to recognize the lease in its
balance sheet. 
Minority Interests
Minority interests may not be included as part of Group shareholders' equity in the consolidated
balance sheet.  They must be shown as a separate item between third-party capital and shareholders' equity. 
 /// Acquisition/Disposal of Subsidiaries
Effective March 26,  2004,  adidas-Salomon assumed full ownership of its subsidiary in Turkeyadidas Spor Malzemeleri Satis ve Pazarlama A. S.,  Istanbul,  by purchasing the remaining 49% of
shares from Esem Spor Giyim Sanayi ve Ticaret A. S.,  a listed Turkish trading company,  for an
amount of € 10 million. 
In the course of a tender offer for all remaining outstanding common shares of
Salomon & Taylor Made Co.,  Ltd.,  Tokyo (Japan),  adidas-Salomon purchased 3127361 shares for
an amount of € 29 million.  This increased Salomon S. A. 's ownership in Salomon & Taylor Made Co. Ltd.  to 993% of common stock from 792% prior to the offer.  Settlement for tenders received took
place on May 20,  2004.  In the course of the second half of 2004,  Salomon S. A. 's ownership
increased to 9987% for an amount of € 1 million.  The additional contribution to the Group's net
income for the period from May to December 2004 was € 25 million. 
Additionally,  adidas-Salomon assumed control of Valley Apparel Company (renamed to adidas
Team Inc. ),  Cedar Rapids,  Iowa (USA),  its long-standing licensee for adidas products,  by acquiring
100% of the shares for an amount of € 5 million,  effective June 4,  2004.  Valley Apparel is a producer
and distributor of collegiate and professional league apparel and accessories.  The subsidiary
contributed net losses of € 03 million to the Group for the period from June to December 2004. 
Effective June 30,  2004,  adidas-Salomon assumed full ownership of its former warehouse
service provider in the Netherlands,  Maersk Ewals Logistics B. V.  (renamed to adidas Logistics
Services B. V. ),  Moerdijk,  for an amount of € 5 million.  The subsidiary contributed net losses of
€ 0 million to the Group for the period from July to December 2004. 
adidas-Salomon assumed full ownership of its subsidiary in Malaysia,  adidas Malaysia Sdn. 
Bhd.,  Kuala Lumpur,  by purchasing the remaining 40% of shares effective October 4,  2004,  for an
amount of € 3 million.  The additional net income for the Group for the period from October to
December 2004 was € 0 million. 
Effective December 31,  2004,  adidas-Salomon sold the remaining 51% of shares of erima
Sportbekleidungs GmbH,  Pfullingen (Germany),  for an amount of € 04 million considering dividends
received for the full year. 
If all acquisitions after March 30,  2004 had occurred on January 1,  2004,  Group net sales
would have been € 6484 billion and net income would have been unchanged. 
In 2003,  adidas-Salomon acquired no subsidiaries.

Investment property held-for-sale relates to parts of land of the former 'Herzo Base" in
Herzogenaurach.  This land,  owned by the GEV Grundstücksgesellschaft Herzogenaurach mbH & Co. 
KG,  was bought (through acquisition of 90% of the shares) in 1998. 
One part of the land is in use for the development of adidas-Salomon's international headquarters 'World of Sports",  and is included under property,  plant and equipment.  The remaining
part,  not needed by adidas-Salomon,  has a size of 77 hectares and is to be sold.  According to the
'Urban Design Contract",  signed with the town of Herzogenaurach in December 2001,  this land is
to be split into a housing area (31 hectares),  an industrial area (19 hectares),  a public area (24
hectares) and other areas (3 hectares).  Furthermore,  GEV has to undertake specified opening and
development measures as well as to transfer a small piece of land to the town of Herzogenaurach
at predetermined conditions. 
The fair value of this investment property cannot be determined reliably at the current timeas the land is not yet fully developed and a binding development plan and building permits exist
only partially.  However,  the Group estimates that the fair value of the land could be a mid-doubledigit million euro amount. 
To secure an appropriate market value,  the Group continued in 2004 to pursue the development and commercialization under the control of GEV as decided in 2002.  In 2004,  GEV sold several
pieces of land in the housing area.  The development and sale of the complete area is expected to
occur within the next 15 years. 
Investment property held-for-sale includes the acquisition costs of the land as well as capitalized expenses,  which occurred in connection with the development of the land to be sold. 
Development of the acquisition costs is as follows:

Long-term financial assets include a 10% participation in FC Bayern München AG of € 77 million
which was concluded in July 2002.  This participation is recorded at cost including transaction costsas this equity security does not have a quoted market price in an active market and other methods
of reasonably estimating fair value as at December 31,  2004 and 2003 were inappropriate or
unworkable.  Additionally,  financial assets comprise shares in unconsolidated affiliated companies
of € 2 million and € 3 million at December 31,  2004 and 2003 respectively. 
Long-term financial assets further include investments which are mainly related to a deferred
compensation plan (see note 18).  These are mainly invested in insurance products and are measured
at fair value. 

142

15 /// Borrowings and Credit Lines
In response to the decline in net borrowings by € 352 million to € 594 million in 2004 from
€ 946 million in 2003,  the Group has terminated its € 300 million Belgian Commercial Paper Program and its multinational ABS Program.  Additionally,  the € 750 million German Commercial
Paper Program was not utilized in 2004. 
With settlement on October 8,  2003 adidas-Salomon issued a € 400 million convertible bond
through its wholly owned Dutch subsidiary,  adidas-Salomon International Finance B. V.,  guaranteed
by adidas-Salomon AG.  The bond was issued in tranches of € 50000 each with a maturity up to 15
years.  The bond is,  at the option of the respective holder,  subject to certain conditions,  convertible
from and including November 18,  2003 up to and including September 20,  2018 into ordinary nopar-value bearer shares of adidas-Salomon AG at the conversion price of € 10200 which was fixed
upon issue.  The coupon of the bond is 25% and is payable annually in arrears on October 8 of each
year,  commencing on October 8,  2004.  The bond is convertible into approximately four million nopar-value shares. 

The convertible bond is not callable by the issuer until October 2009 and callable thereaftersubject to a 130% trigger between October 2009 and October 2012 and subject to a 115% trigger
between October 2012 and 2015,  unconditionally thereafter.  Investors have the right to put the bond
in October 2009,  October 2012 and October 2015. 
The fair values of the liability component and the equity conversion component were determined on the issuance of the bond.  The fair value of the liability component,  included in long-term
borrowings,  was calculated using a market interest rate of approximately 53% for an equivalent
straight bond.  The residual amount of € 1166 million (less transaction costs of € 23 million related
thereto),  representing the value of the equity conversion component,  is included in shareholders'
equity in capital reserve. 
In subsequent periods,  the liability component continues to be presented on the amortized
cost basis,  until conversion or maturity of the bond.  The equity conversion component was determined on the issuance of the bond and will not change in subsequent periods. 
In December 2004,  adidas-Salomon AG as guarantor of the bonds irrevocably waived its right
towards all current and future bondholders to elect the cash payment (in lieu of the delivery of
all or part of the shares) upon exercise of the conversion right through a bondholder pursuant to
§ 9 (1) and (2) of the Terms and Conditions of the Bonds. 
The adidas-Salomon stock traded above 110% (€ 11220) of the conversion price of € 102 on
more than 20 trading days within the last 30 trading days in the fourth quarter of 2004.  Consequently,  bond holders have the right to convert their convertible bonds into equity,  beginning
January 1,  2005. 
Gross borrowings declined in 2004 by € 176 million (2003: € 349 million). 
Borrowings are denominated in a variety of currencies in which the Group conducts its business.  The largest portions of effective gross borrowings (before liquidity swaps for cash management purposes) as at December 31,  2004 are denominated in euros (59%; 2003: 64%) and US
dollars (31%; 2003: 26%). 
Month-end weighted average interest rates on borrowings in all currencies ranged from 30%
to 38% and from 25% to 32% for the years ending December 31,  2004 and 2003 respectively. 
As at December 31,  2004 the Group had cash credit lines and other long-term financing
arrangements totaling € 3 billion (2003: € 34 billion); thereof unused credit lines accounted for
€ 20 billion (2003: € 24 billion).  In addition,  the Group had separate lines for the issuance of letters
of credit in an amount of approximately € 03 billion (2003: € 04 billion).  The continuing decline
reflects a shift in payment practices with product suppliers in the Far East,  from letters of credit to
settlements in open account. 
The Group's outstanding financings are unsecured. 
The private placement and convertible bond documentations each contain a negative-pledge
clause and a minimum equity covenant.  As at December 31,  2004,  actual shareholders' equity was
well above the amount of the minimum equity covenant. 

The amounts disclosed as borrowings represent outstanding borrowings under the following
arrangements with aggregated expiration dates as follows:

In comparison to former years,  when all borrowings with short-term maturities which were

reports short-term borrowings. 
The borrowings relating to the outstanding convertible bond changed in value and classification,  reflecting the accruing interest on the debt component in accordance with IFRS requirements
and the first possibility to redeem the bond in 2009. 
Information regarding the Group's protection against interest rate risks is also included in

20 /// Minority Interests 
In January 2005,  the nominal capital of adidas-Salomon AG was increased by a further
€ 207488 as a result of the exercise of 81050 stock options and the issuance of 81050 no-parvalue bearer shares associated with the eighth exercise period of Tranche II (2000),  the fifth
exercise period of Tranche III (2001) and the second exercise period of Tranche IV (2002) of the

amounted to € 117606528 and is divided into 45940050 no-par-value bearer shares.  Capital
reserves thus increased by € 536352450 in 2005. 

Minority interests are attributable to eight and eleven subsidiaries as at December 31,  2004 and
2003 respectively (see Shareholdings/Attachment I to these notes). 
These subsidiaries were mainly set up together with former independent distributors and
licensees for the adidas brand.  Salomon & Taylor Made Co.,  Ltd.,  Tokyo (Japan) was a public company,  which was listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange from 1995 until the end of 2004.

until May 31,  2005
> by issuing new shares against contributions in cash or in kind once or several times by no more
than a maximum of € 357904317 and,  subject to Supervisory Board approval,  to exclude shareholders' subscription rights (Authorized Capital III);
until July 26,  2005
> by issuing new shares against contributions in cash once or several times by no more than
€ 42800000 altogether and,  subject to Supervisory Board approval,  to exclude fractional shares
from shareholders' subscription rights (Authorized Capital I); and
until July 14,  2009
> by issuing new shares against contributions in cash once or several times by no more than a
maximum of € 11600000 and,  subject to Supervisory Board approval,  to exclude shareholders'
subscription rights as far as fractional shares are concerned or when issuing new shares at a
price not essentially below the stock exchange price (Authorized Capital II). 
Contingent Capital
As set out in § 4 section 5 of the Company's Articles of Association,  in the version dated
January 26,  2005,  the nominal capital of adidas-Salomon AG was increased conditionally by up
to € 1987424 through the issuance of not more than 776337 no-par-value bearer shares (Contingent Capital 1999) for the purpose of granting stock options in connection with the Management
Share Option Plan to members of the Executive Board of adidas-Salomon AG as well as to
managing directors/senior vice presidents of its affiliated companies and to other executives of
adidas-Salomon AG and of its affiliated companies. 
As a result of the exercise of 405250 stock options and the issuance of 405250 no-par-value
bearer shares associated with three exercise periods of Tranche II (2000),  three exercise periods of
Tranche III (2001) and one exercise period of Tranche IV (2002) of the stock option plan ending in
January,  July and October 2004,  the nominal amount of Contingent Capital I at the balance sheet
date amounted to € 2194912,  divided into 857387 no-par-value bearer shares. 
As a result of the exercise of 81050 stock options and the issuance of 81050 no-par-value
bearer shares associated with the eighth exercise period of Tranche II (2000) and the fifth exercise
period of Tranche III (2001) as well as the second exercise period of Tranche IV (2002) of the
Management Share Option Plan in January 2005,  the nominal amount of Contingent Capital I was
reduced after the balance sheet date to € 1987424,  divided into 776337 no-par-value bearer shares. 

The entry of the respective changes to the Articles of Association into the Commercial Register was made on January 26,  2005. 
In accordance with § 4 section 6 of the Company's Articles of Association,  the nominal capital
is conditionally increased by up to a further € 23040000,  divided into not more than 9000000 nopar-value bearer shares (Contingent Capital 2001).  The contingent capital increase will be implemented only to the extent that the holders of the subscription or conversion rights or the persons
obligated to exercise the subscription or conversion duties based on the bonds with warrants or
convertible bonds,  which are issued or guaranteed by the Company or a wholly-owned direct or
indirect subsidiary of the Company pursuant to the authorization of the Executive Board on the
basis of the shareholder resolution dated May 8,  2003,  make use of their subscription or conversion
right or,  if they are obligated to exercise the subscription or conversion rights,  they meet their
obligations to exercise the warrant or convert the bond.  The Executive Board is authorized,  subject
to Supervisory Board approval,  to fully suspend the shareholders' rights to subscribe the bonds
with warrants and/or convertible bonds if the Executive Board has concluded following an examination in accordance with its legal duties that the issue price of the bonds with warrants and/or
convertible bonds is not significantly below the hypothetical market value computed using recognized financial calculation methods.  This authorization to suspend the subscription rights applieshowever,  only with respect to the bonds with warrants and/or convertible bonds with subscription
or conversion rights to the shares having a pro rata amount of the registered share capital totaling
 maximum of € 11600000. 
The nominal value of Contingent Capital 2003 as at the balance sheet date amounted to
€ 23040000,  as a conversion of the bonds was not yet possible by that date.  The requirements for
the exercise of the conversion right,  pursuant to § 6 section 5 (a) of the Terms and Conditions of
the Convertible Bond issued by adidas-Salomon International Finance B. V.,  were met on December
31,  2004,  as the XETRA quotation of the adidas-Salomon shares on at least 20 trading days within a
period of 30 consecutive trading days,  ending on the last trading day of this calendar year,  exceeded
110% of the relevant conversion price.  On February 18,  2005,  the nominal value of Contingent
Capital 2003 still amounts to € 23040000,  as the bondholders entitled to convert have not made
use of their right to conversion of their bonds into shares. 
The conversion right may be exercised during the period commencing on January 1,  2005
and ending on September 20,  2018,  subject to the expiration of the conversion right according to
§ 6 section 3 or subject to the excluded period specified in § 6 section 4 of the Terms and Conditions
of the Convertible Bond. 
By resolution of the Annual General Meeting held on May 13,  2004,  Contingent Capital II
resolved upon by the Annual General Meeting of May 10,  2001,  in the amount of up to € 23040000was cancelled,  as such contingent capital could no longer be used following the entry with the
Commercial Register on June 26,  2003 of the cancellation of the Company's authorization to issue
bonds with warrants and convertible bonds. 

On the occasion of the Annual General Meeting on May 13,  2004,  the shareholders resolved
upon the creation of a further contingent capital and the authorization to issue bonds with warrants
and convertible bonds.  In accordance with such new § 4 section 7 of the Articles of Associationentered into the Commercial Register on July 27,  2004,  the nominal capital is conditionally
increased by up to a further € 9100000,  divided into not more than 3554687 no-par-value bearer
shares.  The contingent capital increase will only take place to the extent that the holders of the
subscription or conversion rights or the persons obligated to exercise the subscription or conversion duties based on the bonds with warrants or convertible bonds,  which are issued or guaranteed
by the Company or a subsidiary of the Company pursuant to the authorization of the Executive
Board on the basis of the shareholder resolution dated May 13,  2004,  make use of their subscription or conversion right or,  if they are obligated to exercise the subscription or conversion rightsthey meet their obligations to exercise the warrant or convert the bond.  The Executive Board is
authorized,  subject to Supervisory Board approval,  to fully suspend the shareholders' rights to
subscribe the bonds with warrants and/or convertible bonds,  if the bonds with warrants and/or
convertible bonds are issued at a price which is not significantly below the market value of these
bonds.  The limit for subscription right exclusions of 10% of the registered stock capital according to
§ 186 section 3 sentence 4 together with § 221 section 4 sentence 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act is observed. 
Acquisition of own shares
By resolution of the Annual General Meeting held on May 13,  2004,  the shareholders of adidasSalomon AG authorized the Company to acquire own shares in an aggregate amount of up to 10%
of the nominal capital for any permissible purpose until November 12,  2005.  The report of the
Executive Board stated in particular the following purposes for such acquisition:
> For the resale of shares against cash at a price not significantly below the stock market price of
the shares with the same features. 
> For the purpose of acquiring companies,  parts of companies or participations in companies. 
> As consideration for the acquisition of industrial property rights such as patents,  brands,  names
and logos of athletes,  sports clubs and other third parties or for the acquisition of licenses
relating to such rights. 
> To meet subscription or conversion rights or conversion obligations arising from bonds with
warrants and/or convertible bonds issued by the Company or any direct or indirect subsidiary of
the Company. 
> To meet the Company's obligations arising from the Management Share Option Plan 1999
(MSOP). 
> To assign to Executive Board members as compensation in the form of a stock bonus subject to
the provision that a resale shall only be permitted following a retention period of at least two
years from the date of assignment. 
It is stipulated that the acquisition of companies or participations,  industrial property rights or
licenses may also be made via subsidiaries. 
Information pursuant to § 21 German Securities Trading Act (WPHG)
adidas-Salomon AG was informed on October 22,  2004 by Barclays PLC,  London (UK),  and its
subsidiaries that they hold in total 54% of the voting rights.

23 /// Financial Instruments
Management of Foreign Exchange Risk
The Group is subject to currency exposure,  primarily due to an imbalance of its global cash flows
caused by the high share of product sourcing invoiced in US dollars,  while sales other than in
US dollars are invoiced mainly in European currencies,  but also in Japanese yen,  Canadian dollars
and other currencies.  It is the Group's policy to hedge identified currency risks arising from forecasted transactions when it becomes exposed.  In addition,  the Group hedges balance sheet risks
selectively. 
Risk management is conducted by using natural hedges and arranging forward contractscurrency options and currency swaps.  It is Group policy to have a high share of hedging instruments,  such as currency options or option combinations,  which provide protection and,  at the same
time,  retain the potential to benefit from future favorable exchange rate developments in the financial markets.  In 2004,  the share of options hedging increased compared to 2003. 
In 2004,  the Group contracted currency options with premiums paid in a total amount of
€ 22 million (2003: € 17 million).  Since currency options serve as cash flow hedges for future
product transactions,  the related premiums are recorded in income at the same time as the underlying transaction is recorded.  The total amount of option premiums,  which was charged to income
in 2004,  is € 17 million (2003: € 11 million).  Paid option premiums (as part of the total capitalized
fair value) in an amount of € 25 million and € 18 million were deferred as at December 31,  2004
and 2003 respectively. 
The total net amount of US dollar purchases against other currencies was $ 17 billion and
$ 16 billion in the years ending December 31,  2004 and 2003 respectively. 
The notional amounts of all outstanding currency hedging instruments,  which are mainly
related to cash flow hedges,  are summarized in the following table:

negative fair value of € 19 million from cash flow hedges and a positive fair value of € 1 million
from net investment hedges (see further details below).  The total fair value of outstanding currency
options relates to cash flow hedges. 
The fair value adjustments of outstanding cash flow hedges for forecasted sales will be
reported in the income statement when the forecasted sales transaction is recorded,  the wide
majority being forecasted for 2005.  One cash flow hedge,  which related to an embedded derivative
within a specific contract,  was closed out in 2004 and the remaining fair value was reallocated from
equity to the income statement.  Other significant embedded derivatives did not exist at the balance
sheet date. 
In addition,  adidas-Salomon hedges part of its net investment in Salomon & Taylor Made Co. Ltd.,  Tokyo (Japan) with forward contracts.  A related gain of € 1 million in 2004 (2003: € 15 million)
is recognized in equity.

Management of Interest Rate Risk
It has been the policy of the Group to concentrate its financing on short-term borrowings,  but to
protect against liquidity risks with longer-term financing agreements,  and to protect against the
risk of rising interest rates with interest rate caps,  cross-currency interest rate swaps and interest
rate swaps.  In view of the continuing decline of the borrowings,  no additional caps were arranged in
2004.  Additionally,  maturing interest rate caps amounting to approximately € 200 million were not
renewed. 
The interest rate hedges which were outstanding as at December 31,  2004 and 2003 respectively expire as detailed below:

and Amortization [excluding Goodwill])
Operating expenses include expenses for sales,  marketing and research and development,  as well
as for logistics and central finance and administration.  In addition,  they include depreciation on
tangible and amortization on intangible assets,  with the exception of goodwill amortization and
other depreciation and amortization which is included in the cost of sales. 
 significant portion of the operating expenses comprises the marketing working budget.  The
marketing working budget consists of promotion and communication spending such as promotion
contracts,  advertising,  retail support,  events and other communication activities,  however it does
not include marketing overhead expenses.  In 2004,  marketing working budget accounted for
approximately 35% (2003: 35%) of the total operating expenses. 
Total depreciation and amortization expense for tangible and intangible assets (excluding
goodwill) was € 116 million and € 110 million for the years ending December 31,  2004 and 2003
respectively.  Thereof € 14 million and € 15 million were recorded within the cost of sales as they
are directly attributable to the production costs of goods sold.

The interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps had a negative fair value of
€ 74 million as at December 31,  2004 and 2003 respectively. 
Several of the instruments qualify as cash flow hedges pursuant to IAS 39.  The related negative change in fair value of € 02 million was debited in equity and will be expensed in accordance
with interest rate developments in parallel to the underlying hedged item.  The negative change in
the fair value of the remaining instruments of € 02 million was recorded directly in the income
statement,  as incurred. 
Credit Risk
The Group's treasury department arranges currency and interest rate hedges,  and invests cashwith major banks of a high credit standing throughout the world,  all being rated 'A-" or higher in
terms of Standard & Poor's long-term ratings (or a comparable rating from other rating agencies). 
Generally,  foreign Group companies are authorized to work with banks rated 'BBB+" or
higher.  In exceptional cases,  they are authorized to work with banks rated lower than 'BBB+'.  To
limit risk in these cases,  restrictions such as limited amounts of cash deposits with these banks
are stipulated.

Deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that the realization of the related benefit
is probable.  Based on the past performance and the prospects of the respective business for the
foreseeable future,  valuation allowances are established where this criterion is not met. 
Valuation allowances refer to deferred tax assets of companies which are operating in the
start-up phase or in certain emerging markets,  since the realization of the related tax benefits is
not probable.  Further,  adidas Salomon North America Inc.  has deductible temporary differencesunused foreign tax credits and tax loss carryforwards,  which can in part only be utilized in limited
annual amounts through to 2007,  for which a valuation allowance is established for amounts in
excess of income projections. 
The Group does not recognize deferred tax liabilities for unremitted earnings of non-German
subsidiaries to the extent that they are expected to be permanently invested in international operations.  The earnings,  the amount of which cannot be practicably computed,  could become subject to
additional tax if they were remitted as dividends,  or if foreign earnings were loaned to the subsidiary,  or if the Group were to sell its shareholdings in the subsidiaries.

NOTES ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net income attributable to shareholders by
the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. 
Dilutive potential shares have arisen under the Management Share Option Plan (MSOP) of
adidas-Salomon AG,  which was implemented in 1999.  As none of the required performance criteria
for the exercise of the stock options of Tranche I (1999) of the share option plan have been fulfilled
to date,  this Tranche did not affect the calculation of dilutive earnings per share.  However under
Tranches II (2000),  III (2001) and IV (2002) of the share option plan,  dilutive potential shares impact
the diluted earnings per share calculation. 
It is necessary to include dilutive potential shares arising from the convertible bond issuance
in October 2003 in the calculation of diluted earnings per share as at December 31,  2004 as the
required conversion criteria were fulfilled at the balance sheet date (see note 15).  The convertible
bond is assumed to have been converted into ordinary shares and the net income is adjusted to
eliminate the interest expense less the tax effect. 

29 /// Segmental Information
The Group operates predominately in one industry segment,  the design,  wholesale and marketing
of athletic and sports lifestyle products.  The Group is currently managed by brands and on the basis
of a regional structure. 
Certain functions of the Group are centralized and an allocation of these functions to specific
segments is not considered to be meaningful.  This includes mainly central treasury,  worldwide
sourcing and global marketing as well as other headquarter departments.  Assets,  liabilitiesincome and expenses relating to these corporate functions are presented in the Headquarter/
Consolidation column together with non-allocable items and the intersegment elimination. 
Compared to the 2003 annual financial statements,  the Salomon segment includes adidas
Cycling.  Net sales for adidas Cycling were approximately € 7 million in 2003.

Financial Analysis
----------------------Consolidated Financial Statements (IFRS)
Notes Additional Information
---155

Net sales to third parties are shown in the geographic market in which the revenues are
realized.  Intersegment sales represent sales to operational units not belonging to the same region. 
The global sourcing function is included in the Headquarter/Consolidation column.  There are no
sales between the brands.  Transactions between the segments are based on the dealing-at-arm'slength principle. 
Segment assets include all operating assets and comprise mainly accounts receivable,  inventory as well as property,  plant and equipment and intangible assets.  Segment liabilities comprise
operating liabilities and consist principally of trade and other payables and accrued liabilities and
provisions.  Non-allocable items include goodwill,  financial assets,  assets and liabilities relating to
income taxes and borrowings,  which are included in the Headquarter/Consolidation column. 
Capital expenditure,  amortization and depreciation relate to segment assets; the acquisition of
goodwill and the inception of finance leases do not affect capital expenditure. 

31 /// Commitments and Contingencies
Other Financial Commitments

Litigation
The Group is currently engaged in various lawsuits resulting from the normal course of businessmainly in connection with license and distribution agreements as well as competition issues.  The
risks regarding these lawsuits are covered by accrued liabilities and provisions when a reliable
estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made (see note 16).  In the opinion of Managementthe ultimate liabilities resulting from such claims will not materially affect the consolidated financial position of the Group. 

32 /// Equity Compensation Benefits
Management Share Option Plan (MSOP) of adidas-Salomon AG
Under the share option plan adopted by the shareholders of adidas-Salomon AG on May 20,  1999
and amended by resolution of the Annual General Meeting on May 8,  2002 and on May 13,  2004,  the
Executive Board has been authorized to issue non-transferable stock options for up to 1367187
no-par-value bearer shares to members of the Executive Board of adidas-Salomon AG as well as to
managing directors/senior vice presidents of its related companies and to other executives of
adidas-Salomon AG and its related companies until August 27,  2004.  The granting of stock options
can take place in tranches that shall not exceed 25 % of the total volume for each fiscal year. 
There is a two-year vesting period for the stock options and a term of approximately five years
upon their respective issue. 
The following stock options have been issued so far:

The stock options may only be exercised subject to the attainment of at least one of the following performance objectives:
(1) Absolute Performance:
During the period between the issuance and exercise of the stock options,  the stock market price
for the adidas-Salomon share calculated upon the basis of the total shareholder return approach
– has increased by an annual average of at least 8%. 
(2) Relative Performance:
During the same period,  the stock market price for the adidas-Salomon share must have developed
by an annual average of 1% more favorably than the stock market prices of a basket of competitors
of adidas-Salomon globally and in absolute terms may not have fallen. 
The stock options may only be exercised against payment of the exercise price.  The exercise
price corresponds to the arithmetical mean of the closing prices of the adidas-Salomon share over
the last 20 trading days of the respective exercise period,  less a discount,  which is composed of the
absolute and relative performance components.  In any case,  the exercise price shall be at least the
lowest issue price as stated in § 9 section 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG),  currently
€ 256. 
The option terms and conditions stipulate that the stock options may be used for existing
common shares in lieu of new shares from the contingent capital,  or in the place of common shares
the discount is paid in cash. 
The new shares participate in profits from the beginning of the year in which they are issued.
