INTERVIEW WITH THE CEO Positive momentum throughout 2007 propelled
the adidas share to reach an all-time high at the end of the year.  The Group again
improved key financial metrics,  including a 7 % currency-neutral sales increase and
14 % earnings growth.  2008 will be a year where the world will be 'United by Sport"
at the European Championship in Austria and Switzerland,  and then at the Beijing
Olympics.  With prominent positions at these two events and strong execution
of brand strategies,  the Group expects even stronger top- and bottom-line growth
in 2008. 

Herbert Hainer
CEO and Chairman of the Executive Board 
TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS  Interview with the CEO

ANNUAL REPORT 2007 -- adidas Group 
IN THE FOLLOWING INTERVIEW,  HERBERT HAINER,  ADIDAS GROUP CEO AND CHAIRMAN,  REVIEWS 2007,  AND DISCUSSES
THE GROUP'S STRATEGIC AND FINANCIAL OUTLOOK. 

013

HERBERT,  THE ADIDAS GROUP AGAIN MADE BIG STRIDES IN 2007.  WHAT DO YOU THINK WERE THE CENTRAL DRIVERS
OF YOUR STRONG PERFORMANCE?

Following the acquisition of Reebok and the big success we achieved at the FIFA World Cup™ in 2006,  we knew we had
 lot to accomplish in 2007 to keep the Group's momentum moving in the right direction.  And I am extremely proud that all
our hard work has helped the Group achieve new record sales and net income levels.  Currency-neutral sales grew 7 %. 
Gross margin increased strongly to 474 %.  Operating margin met our initial expectations reaching 92 %.  Net income and
EPS grew 14 % and all this despite conditions that got tougher in some important markets as the year went on. 

'I am extremely proud that all our hard work has
helped the Group achieve new record sales and net
income levels. "

Our focus on performance and executional excellence was a big contributor to our success in 2007.  We took further strides
in innovation and design leadership,  winning several awards,  and gained market share in core sports categories such as
running and football.  We put increased emphasis on controlled space as a key distribution channel for future growth which
means everything from new own-retail formats and expanded franchise networks in emerging markets to creative shopin-shop concepts in more mature markets.  We also made digital communication a strategic priority for all our brands.  And
as we gear up for another intense year of competition both on and off the playing field,  I am convinced these steps have positioned our Group to go even further,  even faster. 

01

THE ADIDAS BRAND EXCEEDED YOUR INITIAL EXPECTATIONS FOR THE YEAR WITH 12 % CURRENCY-NEUTRAL SALES GROWTH. 
WHAT WERE THE MAIN FACTORS BEHIND THIS SUCCESS?

 strong product pipeline and commitment to innovation are the fundamental factors behind adidas' success.  The brand
continued to strengthen its focus on five strategic categories and grew in all of them.  Sales outpaced industry growth
rates in all regions.  The brand's success in emerging markets,  controlled space expansion and continued dominance in
its European home market fueled a third consecutive year of double-digit currency-neutral revenue growth.  Even more
important the segment broke new gross and operating margin records at 474 % and 129 %,  respectively.  This is proof
that adidas' priorities and positioning,  coupled with its ability to harness synergies from the Reebok acquisition,  helped
take the brand a major step forward in operational performance.  With order backlogs up 17 % the highest level in nearly
10 years I am confident adidas will further enhance its leading market positions around the globe in 2008. 

'adidas' success in emerging markets,  controlled space
expansion and continued dominance in its European
home market fueled a third consecutive year of doubledigit currency-neutral revenue growth. "

YOU ARE AN OFFICIAL SPONSOR OF THE UEFA EURO 2008™ AND THE BEIJING OLYMPIC GAMES.  HOW IMPORTANT ARE THESE
AND OTHER MAJOR SPORTING EVENTS FOR THE ADIDAS GROUP?

 key competitive advantage of our Group is the tremendous experience and know-how we have gained from our long tradition
of partnering with major sporting events and leagues.  We are the only sports company to ever sponsor a football World Cup. 
We currently partner with a number of the top marathons around the world including London,  Boston and Berlin.  And our
Group has long-term relationships with every major sports league in North America. 
'I firmly believe we are unrivalled in leveraging the
 firmly believe we are unrivalled in leveraging the opportunities major sporting events provide.  That means not only maximizing licensed sales,  but also enhancing the visibility of our top products and promotion partners to underscore the Group's opportunities major sporting events provide. "
credibility and authenticity in performance sport.  Although sponsoring these events comes at a cost,  we have seen time and
time again that the long-term benefits to brand image far exceed the short-term expenses associated with these events. 
In 2008,  the European Football Championship will be the perfect stage to demonstrate our Group's dominance in the world's
favorite sport.  adidas' role as an Official Sponsor of the event and Outfitter of five participating teams will help the brand
achieve a new sales record in the football category of over € 12 billion generated solely from true performance products. 
And at the Beijing Olympics,  both of our two biggest brands will be front and center.  For adidas this means being the Official
Sportswear Partner to the event as well as outfitting 16 National Olympic Committees including the hosts China.  For Reebokthis means partnering with the event's biggest local star basketball great Yao Ming.  This event will help our Group
become the market leader in China this year,  as well as drive sales growth throughout the region in 2008 and beyond. 

TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS  Interview with the CEO

ANNUAL REPORT 2007 -- adidas Group 
SALES FOR THE REEBOK SEGMENT IN 2007 WERE FLAT,  AND MANY PEOPLE IN THE FINANCIAL COMMUNITY HAVE EXPRESSED
CONCERN ABOUT REEBOK'S PROSPECTS IN 2008.  WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ENHANCE THE BRAND'S POSITIONING AND
PERFORMANCE GOING FORWARD?

015

'We still need to complete the repositioning of the Reebok
Let me start by saying that while we are pleased with the new market opportunities and scale benefits that have already
brand especially in its two largest markets the USA
come to our Group as a result of the Reebok integration,  you are right that we still need to complete the repositioning of
and the UK. "
the Reebok brand especially in its two largest markets the USA and the UK.  To do this,  we clearly have to maintain our
discipline and focus on Reebok.  In 2007,  we made major management changes at the Reebok brand.  We took tough decisions
to improve US distribution even stopping supply to the brand's largest customer where excess inventories had led
to a significant decline in profitability. 
But the real test is still in front of us making the Reebok brand more relevant to consumers.  The brand needs simple
messages that stick,  and that's why its 2008 products and marketing strategies focus on two important concepts fit and
choice.  Reebok is striving to be the brand that 'fits me".  This means creating the perfect fit with all its consumers,  customers
and business partners alike.  Therefore,  Reebok has sharpened its 2008 product offering by including 893 new fit initiatives
throughout its collections.  In addition,  Reebok is customizing its product offering for key retail partners which means more
relevant products for consumers,  and higher margins for Reebok.  And through the launch of the brand's global communication campaign –'Your Move"– Reebok is set to establish itself as a supporter of individual choice and a challenger of convention. 

01

We still have a long way to go.  As we announced at our Investor Day six months ago,  sales will not grow for Reebok in the USA 'We not only expect sales and profitability for the segment
to increase in 2008 but more importantly,  the brand
and the UK in 2008.  But I do expect the order situation in these markets to improve later this year.  And sales will grow in

also improve. "
As a result,  we not only expect sales and profitability for the segment to increase in 2008 but more importantly,  the brand
perception amongst consumers around the world should also improve.

THE ECONOMIC CLIMATE IN NORTH AMERICA HAS DETERIORATED IN RECENT MONTHS.  HOW DO YOU SEE THE ADIDAS GROUP
NAVIGATING THROUGH THESE CHALLENGES IN 2008?

'I am optimistic we will outperform most of our competiYes,  economic conditions in North America have become more difficult.  Nonetheless,  I am optimistic we will outperform
tors during this period of relative economic weakness. "
most of our competitors during this period of relative economic weakness.  We are a regionally diversified Group,  which is
one of our most significant strengths.  We have been diligent in managing the adidas brand in the USA over the past few
years which has brought adidas four years of consecutive growth in the world's largest sporting goods market.  Todaywe have a much broader distribution base and a significantly improved performance product and partnership portfolio in the
region.  Therefore,  I am confident that the adidas brand will again grow in North America in 2008 although it is likely to be
at lower levels than in recent years.  At Reebok,  there are still a lot of challenges and tough market conditions don't make
it any easier.  But I am confident the brand has the right initiatives in place to position itself for growth in this market in 2009. 

HOW DO YOU RATE THE PERFORMANCE OF TAYLORMADE-ADIDAS GOLF IN 2007 AND WHAT PRIORITIES HAVE YOU SET FOR
THIS BUSINESS GOING FORWARD?

TaylorMade-adidas Golf strives to be the best performance golf business in the world.  And nothing highlights this more than
our performance in metalwoods last year.  Despite fierce competition and technological hype in golf's most prestigious categoryTaylorMade extended its market share lead over its closest competitor to more than ten points.  And adidas Golf sales
of footwear and apparel grew at double-digit rates for the fifth consecutive year.  Segment like-for-like sales,  excluding the
effects of the Greg Norman Collection wholesale business divestiture,  grew 9 % on a currency-neutral basis,  driven by
increases in all major categories.  For 2008,  increasing profitability is our top priority.  We believe there is no reason why
TaylorMade-adidas Golf shouldn't be delivering a double-digit operating margin in the very near future.  We sold Maxfli
because we now have all the know-how we need to be successful in the premium golf ball category.  We are focused on
growing our core golf brands: TaylorMade and adidas Golf. 

AFTER A SOLID 2007,  WHAT CAN WE EXPECT FROM THE GROUP IN TERMS OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IN 2008?

We have worked hard to position ourselves for continued growth in 2008.  I am confident our progress will accelerate versus 'In 2008,  we will reach new heights on both the top
and bottom line. "
last year and we will reach new heights on both the top and bottom line.  We expect high-single-digit currency-neutral sales
growth driven by improvements at all of our brands.  Gross margin will range between 475 % and 48 %.  And our operating
margin will expand to at least 95 %.  Through this strong operational performance,  we will increase net income by at least
15 %. 

TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS  Interview with the CEO

ANNUAL REPORT 2007 -- adidas Group 
GIVEN THE STRONG TOP-LINE TARGET AND PROJECTED NET SYNERGIES FOR 2008,  HOW DID YOU ARRIVE AT YOUR GUIDANCE
OF AT LEAST 15 % NET INCOME GROWTH,  WHICH APPEARS CONSERVATIVE?

017

Our top priority is ensuring long-term sustainable growth and profitability increases for the Group.  Maintaining a strong gross 'Our top priority is ensuring long-term sustainable
margin is crucial,  and although we see great potential in the Reebok segment and throughout our supply chain for further
growth and profitability increases for the Group. "
improvement,  rising input costs towards the end of the year will counteract some of the progress we expect.  We also need
to keep investing in our brands to capitalize on both short-term opportunities and to realize our long-term strategic goals. 
In 2008,  we will also have costs related to the year's major sporting events and other important brand initiatives such as
expanding our controlled space activities.  In addition,  our share buyback program will moderate our progress on financial
expense reduction.  Underlying improvements at all of our brands and increased net synergies relating to the Reebok
integration,  however,  will more than offset these negative effects.  As a result,  I am proud that we will be able to deliver
earnings improvement of at least 15 % marking our eighth consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth. 

01

INCREASING SHAREHOLDER VALUE AND RETURNS IS ONE OF THE ADIDAS GROUP'S GUIDING PRINCIPLES.  WHAT ARE YOUR
PLANS IN THIS RESPECT,  GIVEN YOUR RECENTLY ANNOUNCED SHARE BUYBACK PROGRAM?

The best way to deliver value to our shareholders is through strong financial performance and disciplined balance sheet
management.  Since completing the Reebok acquisition in the first quarter of 2006,  we have reduced our net borrowings
by around € 12 billion.  With financial leverage of 584 % at the end of 2007,  we now have flexibility to deliver more aggressive
shareholder returns.  As a result,  we announced a share buyback program of up to € 420 million in January.  This tool will
provide our shareholders with an even higher participation in our future financial performance through enhanced earnings
per share growth.  And combining this with our total dividend increase of 19 %,  we will return more to shareholders in
2008 than ever before.  These initiatives clearly highlight our confidence in the health of our business,  our future business
prospects and the strong cash flows we expect to generate going forward. 

HERBERT,  THANK YOU FOR THIS INTERVIEW.

SUPERVISORY BOARD REPORT Dear Shareholders,  2007 was another very successful year for
the adidas Group.  This success represents both a challenge as well as a motivation for us to
consistently continue implementing the Group's strategic goals going forward.  In 2008,  we expect
major sports events and exciting new product launches to drive further expansion of our brands'
market positions around the world. 

Dr.  Hans Friderichs
Chairman of the Supervisory Board 
SUPERVISORY FUNCTIONS In the year under review,  we,  as the Supervisory Board,  carefully and regularly monitored the
Group's management.  We advised the Executive Board on matters relating to the strategic development of the Group as well
as major individual initiatives.  In this respect,  the Executive Board informed us regularly,  extensively and in a timely manner
at Supervisory Board meetings as well as by additional oral and written reports.  This information covered the Group's
corporate policy as well as all relevant aspects of business planning,  including finance,  investment and personnel planning. 
We were also kept up-to-date on the course of business,  the operational position of adidas AG and the Group (including
the risk situation and risk management),  the Group's financial position and profitability,  as well as all major decisions and
business transactions.  We were involved in all of the Group's fundamental decisions at an early stage. 
We held four Supervisory Board meetings in 2007 and one constituent meeting immediately following our meeting on
November 7,  2007.  Further,  we passed additional resolutions on urgent matters between our meetings.  All Supervisory Board
members attended more than half of the Supervisory Board meetings.  The external auditor KPMG Deutsche TreuhandGesellschaft Aktiengesellschaft Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft,  Frankfurt am Main (KPMG) attended all meetings.  In additionHenri Filho (Chairman of the Supervisory Board until November 7,  2007) and Dr.  Hans Friderichs (formerly Deputy Chairman
of the Supervisory Board and now Chairman of the Supervisory Board,  since November 7,  2007) also maintained regular
contact with the Executive Board beyond the Supervisory Board meetings.  We kept ourselves thoroughly informed regarding
the current business situation,  major business transactions and upcoming decisions. 

TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS  Supervisory Board Report 
ANNUAL REPORT 2007 -- adidas Group 
MAIN TOPICS COVERED AND EXAMINED BY THE SUPERVISORY BOARD AS A WHOLE The development of sales and
results as well as the financial position of the Group and development of the individual brand segments was presented to us
in detail by the Executive Board and subsequently discussed at each of our meetings.  Other Supervisory Board agenda items
included numerous individual topics which we discussed in depth with the Executive Board.  These discussions did not give
rise to any doubt as to the legality or regularity of the Executive Board's management. 

021

The main topic on the March 6,  2007 financial statements meeting agenda was the review of the adidas AG annual financial
statements,  the consolidated financial statements and the respective Management Reports for the year ending December 312006,  as certified by the auditor.  The Supervisory Board also reviewed the Executive Board's proposal regarding the appropriation of retained earnings.  Following initial Audit Committee examination and consultation,  the Supervisory Board as a whole
discussed material aspects of these financial statements with the Executive Board and KPMG.  Both provided us with detailed
responses to all of our questions.  After having carefully considered adidas AG's financial position and the expectations of shareholders and the capital market,  we approved the proposal put forward by the Executive Board regarding the appropriation
of retained earnings.  In addition,  we discussed resolutions to be proposed to the 2007 Annual General Meeting.  Of particular
importance was the restructuring of Supervisory Board compensation which will become effective as of 2008. 
see Compensation Report,  p.  030 On the basis of the previous Audit Committee discussions,  we also resolved to propose to the Annual
General Meeting that KPMG again be appointed as Auditor and Group Auditor.  KPMG was not present during the discussions
regarding this resolution.  We also approved all other resolutions which would later be put to the Annual General Meeting. 
Lastly,  the Executive Board reported to us at this meeting on the development of the TaylorMade-adidas Golf segment,  including the Maxfli golf ball brand acquired at the beginning of 2003. 

01

The main focus of our May 9,  2007 meeting was the first quarter 2007 financial results as presented by the Executive Board
as well as the business development of the Rockport brand,  which was purchased as part of the Reebok acquisition.  Additional topics we dealt with included confidentiality of the Supervisory Board's work,  Insider Law and Directors' Dealings. 
At our August 7,  2007 Supervisory Board meeting,  discussions focused on the financial report for the first six months of
the year and the anticipated development of business for the remainder of 2007.  Several internal corporate restructuring
measures in the context of the Reebok integration were also reviewed.  In addition,  we discussed the potential sale of the
Herzo-Base to an external investor group and established the 'Herzo-Base" Committee ad hoc.  A further agenda item
was the appointment of KPMG as auditor of the 2007 annual financial statements of adidas AG and the consolidated financial
statements as well as a review of the audit points and priorities agreed between the Audit Committee and KPMG. 
At our November 7,  2007 Supervisory Board meeting,  the Executive Board presented its report on the business development
in the first nine months of the year.  After in-depth consideration,  we also approved the budget and investment plan for 2008which was presented by the Executive Board with detailed documentation.  Following the resignation of Henri Filho at the
end of this meeting,  we immediately held a constituent Supervisory Board meeting,  at which we discussed Corporate Governance topics and personal changes on the Supervisory Board. 
Resolutions of fundamental importance passed outside of our regular meetings related to a capital increase at our subsidiary
adidas North America,  Inc.,  with a view to optimizing the finance needs of several US companies,  as well as the presentation
of the Declaration of Compliance. 

ANNUAL REPORT 2007 -- adidas Group 
022

REPORT FROM THE COMMITTEES In order to perform our tasks in an efficient manner,  we have four Supervisory Board
standing committees.  We also established the project-related 'Herzo-Base" Committee ad hoc.  The standing committees
prepare specific topics to be dealt with by the Supervisory Board as a whole.  see Supervisory Board,  p.  025 In a few individual
cases,  as appropriate by law,  we have delegated decision-making powers to these committees.  At our Supervisory Board
meetings,  the chairmen of the committees always reported to us in detail about the committees' work and meetingsensuring complete exchange of information and good cooperation between the committees and the Supervisory Board as
 whole. 
The committees' work in the year under review is summarized as follows:


The Steering Committee,  which is authorized to pass resolutions on behalf of the Supervisory Board in special urgent
cases,  did not meet in the year under review as there was no reason to do so. 
The General Committee met three times in 2007.  The main topics of this committee's discussions and resolutions were
the structure and amount of Executive Board compensation,  as well as the routine review of Executive Board agreements. 
In addition,  the committee approved the extension of a project-related consultancy agreement with one Supervisory Board
member until June 30,  2007. 


The Audit Committee met four times in 2007.  The auditor was always in attendance.  Committee members discussed the
annual financial statements of adidas AG and consolidated financial statements for 2006 intensively,  as well as the half year
and nine months results for 2007,  as presented by the Executive Board.  The auditor reported to the committee on its
auditing activities and results in detail,  as well as on the implementation of risk management throughout the Group following the acquisition of Reebok.  Further,  the Audit Committee prepared a Supervisory Board proposal for the Annual General
Meeting recommending the appointment of the auditor and obtained the auditor's declaration of independence.  Committee
members also established the priority topics for the audit and decided on the auditor's fee.  Additionally,  the Audit Committee
thoroughly reviewed the Global Internal Audit report on internal auditing activities. 


The Mediation Committee again had no reason to meet in 2007. 

The 'Herzo-Base" Supervisory Board Committee established ad hoc met in December 2007 to deal with the
'Sale of Herzo-Base" project. 

TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS  Supervisory Board Report 
ANNUAL REPORT 2007 -- adidas Group 
DECLARATION OF COMPLIANCE AND GOOD CORPORATE GOVERNANCE The subject of Corporate Governance is very
important to the Supervisory Board.  We report on Corporate Governance together with the Executive Board.  see Corporate
Governance Report,  p.  026 At our constituent meeting on November 7,  2007,  we discussed the content and implementation of the new
provisions and stipulations of the German Corporate Governance Code as amended on June 14,  2007,  with the Executive Board. 
This also included our deviations from the recommendations.  Additionally,  we decided to establish a Nomination Committee
to prepare for the election of Supervisory Board members at the Annual General Meeting in 2009.  We expect to form this
committee in spring 2008.  We also resolved to conduct an efficiency examination regarding our Supervisory Board work. 
see Corporate Governance Report.  p.  026 On February 11,  2008,  together with the Executive Board,  we presented our updated
Declaration of Compliance with the German Corporate Governance Code in accordance with § 161 of the German Stock
Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz AktG).  This declaration was made permanently available to our shareholders on the
corporate website at www, adidas-Group, com/corporategovernance on the same day.

DETAILED EXAMINATION AND DISCUSSION OF THE 2007 ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS KPMG audited the 2007 annual financial statements and Management Report of adidas AG
prepared in accordance with the requirements of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch HGB) and issued an
unqualified opinion thereon.  The auditor also approved the consolidated financial statements and Group Management Report
without qualification.  These were prepared in accordance with § 315a HGB in compliance with IFRS. 

01

The financial statements,  the proposal put forward by the Executive Board regarding the appropriation of retained earnings
and the auditor's reports were submitted to the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board in a timely manner.  They were
examined first by the Audit Committee on March 3,  2008.  At our meeting on March 4,  2008,  the annual financial statements
were then examined by the Supervisory Board as a whole and discussed in the presence of the auditor.  The auditor reported
the material results of the financial statements audit with focus on the 2007 priority topics as agreed with the Audit Committee. 
These included the regularity of the annual financial statements as incorporated in the consolidated financial statementsimpairment tests for goodwill and intangible assets as well as the completeness of financial instrument information in
accordance with IFRS 7 as presented for the first time in the Notes to the Group's financial statements.  The auditor was
available for questions and the provision of supplementary information.  Having examined the annual financial statements of
adidas AG,  the consolidated financial statements and the Management Reports,  we came to the conclusion that there were
no objections to be raised.  Following the recommendation of the Audit Committee,  we therefore approved the audit
results and adopted the financial statements prepared by the Executive Board at our financial statements meeting.  The
annual financial statements of adidas AG were thus adopted.  We discussed the Group's dividend policy with the Executive
Board and,  in light of the financial position of adidas AG as well as shareholders' and capital market expectations,  we
approved the proposal regarding the appropriation of retained earnings.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT We are committed to the principles of good Corporate
Governance and continually strive to strengthen and sustain the trust that investors,  business
partners,  employees and the public have placed in us.  Accordingly,  our Executive and Supervisory Boards regularly evaluate current national and international standards regarding
responsible,  transparent and efficient company management with the objective of enhancing
corporate governance at the adidas Group and increasing sustainable value.  Corporate
Governance activities in 2007 focused on the implementation of another efficiency examination
of our Supervisory Board on the consultation regarding newly introduced recommendations and
suggestions of the German Corporate Governance Code as well as on the measures necessary
for the early implementation of the EU Audit Directive. 
DUAL BOARD SYSTEM As required by the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz AktG),  adidas AG has a dual board system
which assigns management functions to the Executive Board and control functions to the Supervisory Board.  These two boards. 
are strictly separated in terms of membership and competencies.  Our Executive Board is currently composed of four members. 
see Executive Board,  p.  018 Our 12-member Supervisory Board comprises an equal number of shareholder and employee representatives
in accordance with the German Co-Determination Act (Mitbestimmungsgesetz MitbestG).  see Supervisory Board,  p.  025
INCREASED EFFICIENCY THROUGH SUPERVISORY BOARD COMMITTEES In order to perform its tasks in a most efficient mannerour Supervisory Board has formed expert committees,  whose chairmen report to the entire Supervisory Board on a regular basis. 


The Steering Committee,  which consists of the Supervisory Board Chairman and his two deputies,  discusses major issuesprepares resolutions and is authorized in special urgent cases to take resolutions in lieu of the Supervisory Board. 
The co-determined General Committee,  with four members,  is responsible in particular for the preparation of Supervisory
Board resolutions regarding the appointment of Executive Board members.  Further,  the General Committee decides on the
content of the related employment agreements as well as the structure and level of Executive Board compensation. 


The co-determined Audit Committee,  which also comprises four members,  deals primarily with accounting,  risk management
and compliance issues.  It assesses and supervises the auditor's independence and determines audit priorities.  In addition,  the
Audit Committee examines the annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements including Management Reports. 
Further,  the Audit Committee prepares the respective Supervisory Board resolutions as well as the agreement with the auditor. 
Furthermore,  it deals with the quarterly and half-year financial reports. 


The four-member Mediation Committee,  formed in accordance with § 27 section 3 of the German Co-Determination Actis responsible for submitting a proposal to the Supervisory Board regarding the appointment or dismissal of Executive Board
members if the two-thirds Supervisory Board majority required for an appointment or dismissal is not achieved in the preceding
resolution. 


In addition,  a committee was established ad hoc in 2007 with three members for the 'Sale of Herzo-Base" project.

CLOSE COOPERATION BETWEEN EXECUTIVE AND SUPERVISORY BOARDS Our Executive and Supervisory Boards cooperate
closely with each other on a basis of mutual trust in the best interest of the adidas Group.  Our Executive Board develops the
Group's strategic orientation,  coordinates it with the Supervisory Board and ensures its implementation.  The Executive Board
informs the Supervisory Board frequently,  expeditiously and comprehensively on the Group's strategy,  planning,  business development and risk management.  In particular,  the Chairmen of our Executive and Supervisory Boards maintain frequent contact. 
For certain business transactions and measures,  the Executive Board must obtain the Supervisory Board's prior consent.  This
includes,  for example,  entering or exiting major fields of activity and acquiring or divesting substantial corporate holdings.  Furtherthe Executive Board must obtain the Supervisory Board's approval for the budget including the annual capital expenditure and
financial plan.  For particularly urgent matters,  the Supervisory Board may also resolve on issues by way of a written circular
vote.  The Rules of Procedure of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board can be viewed online at www, adidas-Group, com. 
EXAMINATION OF THE EFFICIENCY OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD Regular examination of Supervisory Board efficiency is an
essential component of good Corporate Governance.  The examination is conducted by an external advisor every two years by
means of detailed questionnaires.  All members of the Supervisory Board,  with the exception of the Chairman who resigned
in November,  and the succeeding member,  participated in 2007.  Based on the results of the 2005 efficiency examination,  this year's
survey took the latest demands on the Supervisory Board functions into consideration and focused in particular on the timely
supply of high-quality information by the Executive Board,  activities of the committees taking into account all their functions and
competencies as well as the meeting preparation and realization.  The results show that the Supervisory Board and its committees
fulfill all tasks set by the law,  the Articles of Association and Rules of Procedure. 

01

GROUP-WIDE CODE OF CONDUCT TRAINING STARTS IN 2007 With the implementation of the 'Code of Conduct" in 2006,  our
Executive Board defined business principles and guidelines for law-compliant and ethical behavior for all employees towards other
employees,  business partners and third parties and introduced these principles and guidelines throughout our Group.  Disciplinary
measures are taken against employees who infringe upon a law or the internal Code of Conduct while carrying out the adidas Group's
business.  In 2007,  we began to train employees in compliance-relevant matters by means of an e-learning seminar especially developed for this purpose.  This guarantees further enhancement of our risk management.  see Risk and Opportunity Report,  p.  104
ENSURING TRANSPARENCY AND COMMUNICATION WITH OUR SHAREHOLDERS In accordance with the principles of fair disclosurein view of our international shareholder structure and in order to achieve maximum transparency,  we provide all institutional
investors,  private shareholders,  financial analysts,  employees and the interested public with the same information at the same
point in time,  in both English and German.  For this purpose,  we primarily use our website.  www, adidas-Group, com There we publish
all press releases and ad hoc announcements,  financial reports,  information on our analyst and press conferences,  our Annual
General Meeting and our financial calendar.  In accordance with the new statutory regulations,  we publish throughout Europe,  inter
alia,  notifications on Directors' Dealings,  on changes in the percentage of voting rights as well as all corporate information subject to
disclosure requirements.  These publications can then be accessed centrally through the electronic business register. 

ANNUAL REPORT 2007 -- adidas Group 
028

ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING ATTENDANCE INCREASED FURTHER The Annual General Meeting is a platform for dialog between
our shareholders and the Executive and Supervisory Boards.  It is also the forum for shareholders to execute their voting rights. 
At our Annual General Meeting on May 10,  2007.  44 % of the capital with voting rights was present.  This represents an increase
of 5 percentage points compared to the prior year.  We attribute this considerable increase in the attendance rate to the proxy
solicitation conducted prior to the Annual General Meeting,  when our shareholders were directly contacted and informed on
the exact deadlines,  registration requirements and possibilities for exercising their voting rights.  Furthermore,  our shareholders
may utilize our enhanced Internet service.  This service offers our shareholders the possibility to have their voting rights exercised by
 proxy appointed by adidas AG,  a service which can be requested in writing or via the Internet until the end of the general debate
(78% of the stock capital exercised voting rights via the Internet at the 2007 Annual General Meeting).  In light of the increasing
importance of electronic transmission of information,  we created the necessary preconditions for this with the amendment to the
Articles of Association resolved by the shareholders.  The use of the Internet service has been sustainably supported,  and obstaclesespecially with regard to the cross-border exercise of voting rights,  have been reduced.  At our next Annual General Meeting,  taking place on May 8,  2008 in Fuerth (Bavaria),  we will again provide our shareholders with the best possible service. 
DIRECTORS' DEALINGS AND SHARE OWNERSHIP Pursuant to § 15a of the German Securities Trading Act (Wertpapierhandelsgesetz WpHG) Executive and Supervisory Board members,  other key executives as well as persons in close relationship with
them are required to disclose the purchase or sale of adidas AG shares or related financial instruments within five business days
(Directors' Dealings).  In 2007,  we received eight Directors' Dealings notifications relating to adidas shares (ISIN DE0005003404)which were published at www, adidas-Group, com /directorsdealings.  We received no notification from our Executive or Supervisory Boards
in 2007 relating to their ownership of adidas AG shares or financial instruments pursuant to Article 66 of the German Corporate
Governance Code.  Further,  we did not receive any notifications in 2007 according to which individual Executive or Supervisory
Board members' share ownership reached,  exceeded or fell below the applicable notification thresholds provided in the German
Securities Trading Act.

ANNUAL REPORT 2007 -- adidas Group 
FURTHER RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE GERMAN CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE IMPLEMENTED By resolution of the Annual
General Meeting held on May 10,  2007,  we amended our Articles of Association to ensure that remuneration of Supervisory Board
members will reflect committee participation effective as of 2008.  This means we now follow an additional German Corporate
Governance Code recommendation (hereinafter referred to as 'Code").  In 2007,  both the Executive and Supervisory Boards were
regularly informed on the latest Corporate Governance developments by our Corporate Governance Officer.  The Boards also
examined our compliance with Code regulations,  particularly with the new regulations which came into effect on June 14,  2007. 
As a result of these discussions,  the Executive and Supervisory Boards issued an updated Declaration of Compliance pursuant
to § 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act on February 11,  2008.  The full text version is available for download on our website
at www, adidas-Group, com /corporategovernance together with all past Declarations of Compliance.  Accordingly,  we also fulfill all new
recommendations introduced by the Code Commission in 2007 and comply with the majority of the Code's non-binding suggestions. 

029

adidas AG has been and will continue to be in compliance with all recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code
dated June 14,  2007,  with the following exceptions:


The Directors & Officers' liability insurance for our Executive and Supervisory Board members does not include a deductible
as this is not common practice outside Germany.  Further,  we believe that it is not appropriate for our Group insurance policy,  which
covers a large number of high-level executives in Germany and abroad,  to differentiate between Executive and Supervisory
Board members and other executives. 

01


The determination and review of the structure and level of Executive Board compensation was delegated by the Supervisory
Board to its General Committee in its Rules of Procedure.  The Supervisory Board plenum is informed on the respective results. 
This system has proven successful over time. 


Stock options granted to the Executive Board within the scope of the Management Share Option Plan (MSOP) do not provide a
possibility of a retroactive limitation (cap) for extraordinary,  unforeseen developments as all stock options were granted in May 2003
before this Code recommendation was introduced.  As of 2008,  our Executive Board members do not hold any further stock options. 
Should we decide,  however,  to initiate a new stock option plan in the future,  we will comply with this recommendation. 


We do not specify an age limit for Supervisory Board members as our shareholders currently do not consider this necessary. 

The new regulation of Supervisory Board compensation applicable as of 2008 does not include a variable component linked to the
Group's performance either,  in order to ensure the independent supervision required. 
Ownership of adidas AG shares or related financial instruments by Executive and Supervisory Board members is reported if it
reaches,  exceeds or falls below the notification thresholds provided in the German Securities Trading Act and if adidas AG is notified
of this fact.  We consider the thresholds stipulated in § 21 and § 25 of the German Securities Trading Act as amended in January 2007
and the increased transparency thus achieved by German legislation to be appropriate and sufficient for adidas AG as well. 
In addition,  at the Supervisory Board meeting on November 7,  2007,  the Supervisory Board resolved to comply with the recommendation of the Code to form a nomination committee.  A decision upon the composition of the committee,  which proposes suitable
candidates to the Supervisory Board for recommendation to the Annual General Meeting,  is expected in spring 2008 in order for
the committee to have sufficient time for its tasks with regard to the next election of Supervisory Board members at the Annual
General Meeting in 2009.

COMPENSATION REPORT 1) In our Compensation Report,  we summarize the principles relevant
for determining the compensation of our Executive Board and outline the structure and level
of Executive and Supervisory Board compensation.  Furthermore,  this report contains information
on benefits which the members of our Executive Board will obtain if they resign from office or
retire.  This report was prepared in accordance with the requirements of German commercial law
and the Executive Board Compensation Disclosure Act (Vorstandsvergütungs-Offenlegungsgesetz
– VorstOG).  Further,  it is based on the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance
Code. 
EXECUTIVE BOARD COMPENSATION
THREE COMPONENTS OF COMPENSATION In 2007,  the total Executive Board compensation amounted to € 11127 million. 
In accordance with German Corporate Governance Code recommendations,  compensation for members of our Executive Board
consists of fixed and variable components.  The latter have risk character and a long-term incentive effect.  Compensation is
comprised of (1) a non-performance-related component,  (2) a performance-related component,  and (3) a share-based component. 
The individual components are structured as follows:


The non-performance-related component includes a fixed annual salary and other benefits.  The fixed annual salary is paid in
monthly installments and is regularly reviewed with regard to prevailing market standards and appropriateness.  The review
also takes the financial position of the Group into consideration.  Other benefits mainly comprise the use of a company car,  the
payment of insurance premiums and,  in exceptional cases,  an adjustment amount paid to equalize tax treatment of personal
income between the USA and Germany.  Executive Board members receive no additional compensation for mandates held within
the adidas Group. 


The performance-related component,  which comprises the largest portion of Executive Board compensation,  consists of a
Performance Bonus as well as a bonus paid on the basis of the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP).  Both bonus systems are designed
to provide a direct incentive for Executive Board members to achieve their defined targets and to support sustainable valueoriented management. 
- The amount of the Performance Bonus is linked to the fixed annual salary and is determined by individual performance of
the respective Executive Board member as well as by the Group's financial results based on the development of profits considering the budget.  The Performance Bonus is payable at the end of each year upon determination of target achievement. 
- The amount of the bonus from the Long-Term Incentive Plan 2006 / 2008 (LTIP Bonus 2006 / 2008) depends upon the attainment of certain cumulative earnings improvements based on income before taxes (IBT) during the three-year period from 2006
to 2008.  If targets are met,  payment will be due following the approval of the annual consolidated financial statements for the
period ending December 31,  2008. 


The share-based component is comprised of compensation from the Management Share Option Plan (MSOP).  Option rightswhich were issued in annual tranches in the years 1999 to 2002,  are exercisable over a period of five years following a two-year
vesting period,  provided that at least one of the two performance targets,  absolute performance or relative performance,  has been
attained.  see Note 32,  p.  189 Shares are issued with a performance discount depending on target achievement.  Subsequent changes
to plan conditions are not possible.  No new share option program was proposed at the Annual General Meeting in 2007 and it is
not planned to submit a new proposal in this respect at the Annual General Meeting in May 2008. 

TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS  Compensation Report 
ANNUAL REPORT 2007 -- adidas Group 
RESPONSIBILITY ASSIGNED TO GENERAL COMMITTEE In accordance with its Rules of Procedure,  our Supervisory Board has
assigned all matters relating to the structure and appropriateness of the level of Executive Board compensation to its
co-determined General Committee.  see Supervisory Board Report,  p.  020 This committee considers all compensation elements to be
appropriate,  both individually and in total.  Criteria for the appropriateness of the compensation are the Group's size and global
orientation as well as its financial position.  In addition,  the tasks and contribution of each Executive Board member to the Group's
success,  his individual performance as well as the performance of the entire Executive Board are taken into consideration.

COSTS FOR ACCRUED PENSION ENTITLEMENTS 1)
€ in thousands 
 post-contractual competition prohibition period of six months has been agreed upon with Executive Board member Glenn
Bennett.  adidas AG will pay compensation of 100 % of the annual fixed salary for this period unless adidas AG decides not to insist
upon enforcing this prohibition. 
PENSION COMMITMENTS GRANTED When members of our Executive Board reach the individually agreed retirement age of
65 years and resign from their Executive Board position,  they are entitled to receive a retirement pension.  In addition,  each is
entitled to receive a disability pension should he become incapacitated before reaching retirement age.  Further,  when an
Executive Board member dies,  a widow's pension will be paid. 


Retirement pension: The pension allowance is calculated as a percentage of the pensionable income,  which currently equals the
annual fixed salary.  Starting from a base amount totaling 10 % of the pensionable income,  the pension entitlement increases by
 % for each full year of tenure as an Executive Board member of adidas AG 3) and can reach a maximum level of 40 % of pensionable income.  In the event of the retirement of an Executive Board member prior to reaching the statutory retirement age,  the nonforfeiture of the pension entitlement will be in line with the legal provisions.  The increase of current pension payments or pension
entitlements is index-linked in accordance with German law.

entitlements acquired by our current Executive Board members through the end of 2006,  adidas AG made a one-time payment of
€ 8675 million into a pension fund in 2006.  This reflected the cash value of future pension entitlements and shall be split among
our Executive Board members in proportion to the existing provisions for pension obligations as at that date.  adidas AG made
payments for pension entitlements arising as of 2007 into an external pension trust fund and plans to continue this practice in
the future.  In 2007,  a total contribution of € 545219 was made.  For future pension entitlements of our Executive Board membersadidas AG has established pension reserves.  In the Consolidated Balance Sheet,  plan assets which have arisen from the payments

COMPENSATION IN 2007 Supervisory Board compensation consisted of a fixed annual payment amounting to € 21000 for each
member.  Twice this amount was paid to the Chairman and one and a half times this amount was paid to each Deputy Chairman.  In
addition,  all costs and expenses related to attending Supervisory Board meetings were reimbursed.  Supervisory Board members
who were not in office for the entire fiscal year received a pro rata payment based on the number of days served.  This also applied
for the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and his Deputies. 
COMPENSATION REDEFINED IN ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION AS OF 2008 Supervisory Board compensation was resolved upon and
newly structured by a resolution of the Annual General Meeting on May 10,  2007.  The new regulation becomes effective in 2008.

ANNUAL REPORT 2007 -- adidas Group

OUR SHARE The adidas AG share developed strongly in 2007,  increasing 36% and outperforming
both the DAX-30 and the MSCI World Textiles,  Apparel & Luxury Goods Index.  Outstanding
financial results throughout the year and growing confidence in the Group's medium-term
strategy were the drivers of this outperformance.  The Group's ADR and convertible bond also
appreciated significantly in 2007.  As a result of the Group's strong operational performance in
2007,  we intend to propose a higher dividend at the 2008 Annual General Meeting.  Our
shareholder base is becoming increasingly international and analyst support for the adidas AG
share has strengthened significantly versus the prior year. 
SIGNIFICANT SHARE PRICE INCREASE After trading sideways at the beginning of the year,  our share gained significantly following the release of our 2006 full year results in early March.  Management's financial guidance for 2007 and the confirmation of our
Group's medium-term targets strengthened investor sentiment.  Buoyant merger and acquisition activity in our industry as well as
shareholder notification and speculation around adidas AG also supported our share price development.  In mid-2007,  our share
price declined in line with the DAX-30 and our sector as a result of the US subprime mortgage crisis.  Our share price also suffered
as a result of concerns about the short-term Reebok business outlook,  the weak state of the US mall-based channel as well as
several earnings announcements from suppliers and retailers which were below market expectations.  Despite the positive reaction to our quarterly earnings release in early August,  which exceeded consensus estimates,  our share price trended downwardsin line with the overall market.  Later in the month,  our share price regained slightly after our Investor Day held in CantonMassachusetts,  USA,  due to widespread positive response to the Group's medium-term strategic initiatives.  Positive news flow
from our sector in September and October helped drive improvements in our share.  At the beginning of November,  our wellreceived nine months results supported a share rally throughout the remainder of the year.  The adidas share closed 2007 at its
all-time high of € 5126.  As a result of this development,  our market capitalization increased significantly to € 104 billion at the end
of 2007 versus € 77 billion at the end of 2006. 
ADIDAS AG SHARE A MEMBER OF IMPORTANT INDICES The adidas AG share is included in a variety of high-quality indices around
the world,  most importantly the DAX-30 and the MSCI World Textiles,  Apparel & Luxury Goods Index.  The DAX-30 is a blue chip stock
market index consisting of the 30 major German companies trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.  The MSCI World TextilesApparel & Luxury Goods Index comprises our Group's major competitors.  At December 31,  2007,  our weighting in the DAX-30,  which
is calculated on the basis of free float market capitalization and 12-month share turnover,  was 131 % (2006: 112 %).  Our increased
weighting compared to the prior year was largely a result of the significant increase in our market capitalization.  In additionaverage daily trading volume of the adidas AG share (excluding bank trades) rose from 20 million in 2006 to more than 22 million in

Date of notification 
ADR OUTPERFORMS COMMON STOCK DUE TO EURO APPRECIATION Since its launch on December 30,  2004,  our Level 1 American
Depositary Receipt (ADR) facility has enjoyed great popularity among American investors.  The Level 1 ADR closed the year at
US $ 3720,  representing an increase of 48 % versus the prior year (2006: US $ 2511).  Due to the appreciating euro,  the ADR
outperformed our common stock.  Despite growing volumes in the first half of the year,  the number of year-end ADRs outstanding
declined as a result of capital market uncertainty from the subprime mortgage crisis.  The number of Level 1 ADRs outstanding
decreased slightly to 111 million at year-end 2007 (2006: 113 million).  In November 2007,  we decided to list the adidas AG ADR
on the international OTCQX.  This electronic trading forum includes leading international companies with substantial operating
businesses and credible disclosure policies.  With this listing,  we expect to further increase trading of our ADRs by US investors
in 2008 and beyond.

ADIDAS AG SHARE OUTPERFORMS MAJOR INDICES 2007 was a successful year for the adidas AG share.  Our share price increased
by 36 % compared to the 2006 year-end level.  As a result,  our share significantly outperformed the DAX-30 (+ 22 %) as well as the
MSCI World Textiles,  Apparel & Luxury Goods Index (+ 8 %).  The DAX-30 and the MSCI World Textiles,  Apparel & Luxury Goods Index
both started strongly in 2007,  supported by positive macroeconomic trends,  strong corporate news flow and merger and acquisition
activity.  However,  index growth stalled in the second half of the year as a result of the crisis on the US subprime mortgage marketrising commodity prices and increasing fears about the US economy falling into a recession.  Although the Federal Reserve intervened three times by cutting interest rates by a total of 75 basis points,  the situation on the US market remained difficult with
spill-over effects on the country's economy as well as international credit and capital markets.

STRONG SUSTAINABILITY TRACK RECORD REFLECTED IN INDEX MEMBERSHIPS In recognition of our social and environmental
efforts,  adidas AG is part of several sustainability indices.  In 2007,  adidas AG was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes

HIGHER DIVIDEND PROPOSED The adidas AG Executive and Supervisory Boards will recommend paying a dividend of € 050 to
our shareholders at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) on May 8,  2008 (2006: € 042).  Subject to the meeting's approval,  the dividend
will be paid on May 9,  2008.  The proposed dividend per share represents an increase of € 008 per share.  This increase reflects
the Group's strong operational performance in 2007 and highlights our confidence in the Group's future business performance.  The
total payout of € 102 million (2006: € 85 million) reflects an increase of our payout ratio to 19 % of net income (2006: 18 %).  The dividend proposal follows our dividend policy,  under which the adidas Group intends to pay out between 15 and 25 % of consolidated
net income. 
2007 AGM RESOLVES ON THE AUTHORIZATION FOR SHARE BUYBACK At the AGM on May 10,  2007,  our shareholders approved an
authorization to repurchase shares in an amount of up to 10 % of the stock capital until November 9,  2008.  In January 2008,  the Group
initiated a share buyback program of up to 5 % of share capital.  see Subsequent Events,  p.  117
INCREASINGLY INTERNATIONAL INVESTOR BASE Based on the amount of invitations to our AGM in May 2007,  we estimate that
adidas AG currently has around 80000 shareholders.  According to our latest ownership analysis conducted in February 2008known institutional investors continue to account for approximately 96 % (2007: 96 %) of our shares outstanding.  In the North
American market,  institutional shareholdings increased to 40 % (2007: 37 %).  German institutional investors accounted for 11 %
of adidas AG shares (2007: 12 %).  The shareholdings in the rest of Europe excluding Germany decreased to 38 % (2007: 40 %). 
 % are held by institutional shareholders in other regions of the world (2007: 2 %).  adidas Group Management,  which comprises
current members of the Executive and Supervisory Boards,  continues to hold less than 5 % in total.  Smaller,  undisclosed holdingswhich also include private investors,  continued to account for 4 % (2006: 4 %).

ANALYSTS RAISE RECOMMENDATIONS The adidas Group continued to receive strong analyst support in 2007.  Around 30 analysts
regularly published research reports on adidas AG.  In 2007,  both Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs shifted coverage on our
share to Europe from North America.  This follows a similar trend initiated by other banks in 2006,  after our acquisition of Reebokwhich strongly consolidated the number of footwear and apparel suppliers in the USA.  Now the majority of adidas coverage takes
place in Europe.  Analyst recommendations improved considerably throughout 2007,  as confidence grew regarding our ability to deliver
sustainable operating margin improvement and earnings growth.  The majority of analysts are confident about the medium- and longterm potential of our Group.  This is reflected in the recommendation split for our share as of December 31,  2007.  84 % of analysts
recommended investors to 'buy" our share in their last publication during the 12-month period (2006: 38 %).  16 % advised to hold
our share (2006: 56 %).  No analyst recommended a 'sell" rating (2006: 6 %).

AWARD-WINNING INVESTOR RELATIONS ACTIVITIES adidas AG strives to maintain continuous close contact to institutional and
private shareholders as well as analysts.  In 2007,  Management and the Investor Relations team spent almost twenty full days on
roadshows and presented at numerous national and international conferences.  At the AGM in May 2007,  we conducted a private
shareholder survey regarding satisfaction with our share as an investment as well as our Investor Relations services.  Survey
results illustrated a high level of satisfaction from long-term shareholders and included feedback that more than one third of
shareholders in attendance at our AGM use our Investor Relations website on a regular basis.  In August,  we held our eighth
Investor Day in Canton,  Massachusetts,  USA,  where Management presented updates on Group and brand strategies.  The effectiveness of our Group's Investor Relations activities was highlighted by the Institutional Investor's 2007 Rankings,  where buy-side
participants ranked us as the best Investor Relations program in our sector.  Further,  adidas AG achieved the number two position
in Extel's Pan-European Survey 2007 for the luxury goods sector.  Our Investor Relations products also ranked strongly.  The print
version of our 2006 Annual Report took third place in the DAX-30 by the 'manager magazin" competition 'The Best Annual
Reports" including the top ranking for content.  Our IR Website and Online Annual Report were ranked number one in the consumer
goods industry in the annual MZ awards.

GROUP STRATEGY Our goal as a Group is to

lead the sporting goods industry with brands
built on a passion for sports and a sporting
lifestyle.  We continuously strive to generate
consumer excitement and enhance brand
profitability by executing a clear strategy.  In
everything we do,  we are focused on strengthening and developing our brands to maximize
the Group's operational and financial performance and create shareholder value. 

PERFORMANCE AS CORE GROUP VALUE Our Group's mission
and strategy are rooted in our desire to provide athletes
with the best possible equipment to optimize their performance.  This philosophy originated with our brands' founders
Adi Dassler,  J.  W.  Foster and Gary Adams whose passion for
sport inspired them to develop innovative sports products
and create new sports categories.  We aim to consistently
perform at a level where we not only meet but exceed the
expectations of our stakeholders. 
We strive to be closer to consumers than any of our competitors,  and our unique understanding of consumers enables
us to enhance their athletic experience.  In support of these
efforts,  we continuously optimize our sales and distribution
processes and improve our customer service efforts for our
retail partners.  We make every effort to align our employees'
personal objectives with our Group and brand targets and
reward our staff for high achievement.  see Employees,  p.  068
Further,  we are particularly focused on ensuring best-practice
social and environmental standards.  see Sustainability,  p.  065
 commitment to constantly increase value for our shareholders
is at the core of our activities.  This commitment to top performance differentiates us from other competitors and is a unifying principle across our multi-brand organization. 
LEVERAGING OPPORTUNITIES ACROSS OUR BRAND PORTFOLIO The strength of our brands is a key factor in our Group's
success.  Within our brand portfolio,  we primarily pursue two
strategic options:


Market penetration gaining market share across all
markets in which we compete,  and
Market development expanding into new markets and
addressing new consumer segments. 

LEADING POSITION IN MARKETS WORLDWIDE As a global
organization,  we target leading market positions in all regions
where we compete.  In Europe,  where our Group is the market
leader in terms of sales,  our strategy is two-fold.  First,  we
continue to strengthen our position in the major Western
European markets by growing our brands through wellcoordinated efforts with key account partners.  Secondly,  we
are capitalizing on the strong growth opportunities in the
region's emerging markets (i, e.  Eastern Europe,  the Middle
East and Africa). 
In North America,  we see significant upside potential.  As a
Group,  we are number two in terms of sales,  but we believe
we are currently underrepresented in the North American
sporting goods market.  Therefore,  we target market share
expansion via a strong,  consumer-driven product offeringa diversified distribution strategy,  and visible and engaging
communication initiatives. 
In Asia,  where our Group is the market leader in terms of sales
with number one positions in Japan,  Korea,  India,  ThailandIndonesia and New Zealand,  our goal is to strengthen and
extend our market leadership position.  Our key priority in the
medium term is expanding our business in the region's two
most important markets Japan and China.  In tandem,  we will
also continue to capitalize on opportunities in the other emerging markets of Asia. 
Finally,  in Latin America,  our Group's fastest-growing region
for the last several years,  we are focused on rapidly expanding
our business in the four most important markets: BrazilArgentina,  Mexico and Chile.  Our target is to take over market
leadership in terms of sales by 2010. 

Our multi-brand approach allows us to tackle opportunities
from several perspectives,  as both a mass and niche playerproviding distinct and relevant products to a broad spectrum
of consumers.  In this way,  each brand is able to concentrate
on its core competencies and excel.  Across all brands,  we focus
on increasing awareness and visibility,  providing clear and
consistent messaging and supporting product initiatives at
the point-of-sale.  In addition,  our commercial success also
depends on leveraging the scale of our organization and
sharing best practice across our Group. 

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR GROUP - Structure and Strategy  Group Strategy 
ANNUAL REPORT 2007 -- adidas Group 
EXTENDING INNOVATION AND DESIGN LEADERSHIP We are
determined to address every consumer in a specific and unique
way with product and communication initiatives that generate
trade and consumer interest.  As a result,  we believe that technological innovation and cutting-edge design are essential to
sustainable leadership in our industry. 
Innovation plays a significant role in differentiating our product
offering in the minds of consumers.  By leveraging the extensive
R&D expertise within our Group,  see Research and Development,  p.  072
we continuously challenge the boundaries of functionality and
performance.  It is our objective to launch at least one major
new technology or technological evolution per year. 
Through design partnerships and collaborations with Stella
McCartney,  Yohji Yamamoto,  Porsche Design and Rolland
Berry we are widening our design reach and imbuing our products with the excitement consumers demand.  By continually
expanding our capabilities in R&D and design,  we are able to
introduce new products at high price points,  thus contributing
to Group margin improvement. 

CUSTOMIZING DISTRIBUTION Our Group will drive future
success by engaging consumers with unique interactive product approaches and rewarding point-of-sale experiences. 
Our brands must be competitive in this environment where
consumers make their final purchase decisions based on
availability,  convenience and breadth of product offering.  As
 result,  we are continuously refining our distribution proposition,  concentrating on two areas: expanding controlled space
and improving retail relationships. 
Controlled space includes:


CREATING SHAREHOLDER VALUE Sustainable revenue and
operating profit growth are critical to our success.  see
Internal Group Management System,  p.  056 Creating value for our shareholders through significant free cash flow generation drives
our overall decision-making process.  For each of our brandswe pursue the most value-enhancing avenues for growthwith particular emphasis on continuously improving profitability.  In addition,  rigorously managing working capital and
optimizing financial leverage remain key priorities for us.  As
always,  we are committed to increasing returns to shareholders with above-industry-average share price performance
and dividends. 

045

Our own-retail business
Mono-branded stores run by retail partners
Shop-in-shops that we establish with our key accounts
Joint ventures with retail partners
Co-branded stores with sports organizations or other
brands 
These formats provide us with a high level of brand control
as we either manage the stores ourselves (i, e.  own retail) or
we work closely with our partners (mono-branded storesshop-in-shops,  joint ventures,  co-branded stores) to ensure
the appropriate product offering and presentation at the pointof-sale.  Brand control helps us drive sales and profitability
increases and expand our market positions.  By 2010,  we intend
to generate at least 30% of our Group's revenues through controlled space. 

02

Going forward,  we will also further differentiate and segment
our product offering to align our distribution more closely with
 given retailer's customer base.  In addition,  we are partnering
with retailers to increase the level and quality of sell-through
information we receive.  This creates a mutually beneficial
relationship that will help us become a more valuable and
reliable business partner to our retailers.

ADIDAS STRATEGY adidas has a clear mission –
'to be the leading sports brand in the world". 
To accomplish this mission,  the brand comprises two divisions that reflect two distinct
market segments: Sport Performance and
Sport Style.  Product and marketing initiatives
at adidas primarily focus on five global priorities,  which are expected to generate over
80 % of the brand's top-line growth until 2010:
running,  football,  basketball,  training and
Originals.  The adidas brand attitude
'Impossible is Nothing" drives all brand communication initiatives and helps strengthen the
brand's bond with consumers.  With a welldefined and segmented distribution approach
and a premium-price strategy,  adidas clearly
positions itself as a top-notch brand in all
markets. 

NEW BRAND STRUCTURE ESTABLISHED In 2007,  the adidas
brand continued to gain momentum both financially
see adidas Business Performance,  p.  096 and operationally.  adidas
further evolved its organizational structure,  moving from three
to two divisions.  With Bernd Wahler in Sport Performance
and Hermann Deininger in Sport Style,  adidas appointed two
Chief Marketing Officers who have full ownership of their
respective divisions.  During the year,  adidas not only established the two-divisional structure on a global level but also
rolled it out in the regions of North America and Europe. 
Further,  the brand appointed Patrik Nilsson as new President
of adidas North America to further strengthen its market
position in the region. 
EUROPEAN DISTRIBUTION FURTHER STRENGTHENED In
Europe,  adidas continued to refine its distribution with various
initiatives.  For example,  the brand extended a strategic partnership with its key account Intersport International Corporation. 
Within the scope of this cooperation,  adidas offers customized
product ranges in Intersport stores in categories such as
football and running in 32 markets worldwide.  Additionallyadidas and Intersport will continue to work closely on joint
marketing and event-related initiatives.  adidas also successfully implemented a segmented distribution strategy in the UK
see Risk and Opportunity Report,  p.  104 and continued its strong retail
expansion in Russia. 
PARTNERSHIP NETWORK FURTHER EXTENDED adidas
further expanded its portfolio of promotional partnerships in
2007.  The brand entered into a Tier One partnership with the
London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic
Games (LOCOG),  to become the Official Sportswear Partner
of the London Olympics in 2012.  Brand adidas also extended
partnerships with the German,  Spanish and Hellenic football
federations.  In addition,  the brand signed multi-year agreements with race car driver Dale Earnhardt Jr.,  Texas A & M
University and the University of Michigan.  In the Sport Style
division,  adidas agreed on a multi-year product collaboration
with a leading denim producer,  Diesel,  starting in February 2008. 

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR GROUP - Structure and Strategy  adidas Strategy 
MARKETING CAMPAIGNS LAUNCHED SUCCESSFULLY With
respect to brand communication,  adidas successfully launched
the newest installment of its 'Impossible is Nothing" campaign
– the largest global brand campaign ever implemented in
over 50 countries.  Late in the year,  adidas also kicked off its
Olympics and global football campaigns for 2008. 
INNOVATION LEADERSHIP THROUGH PERSONALIZATION
adidas' innovation philosophy encompasses every facet of the
brand's business from product design and development to
brand marketing,  promotion partnerships and distribution.  In
this area,  personalization represents a key focus.  Personalized
product concepts at adidas include:


Interactive product concepts such as miCoach a new
individual training system to be launched in March / April 2008which can sense,  understand and adapt to the consumer's
needs. 


Customized solutions such as the mi adidas platform or
the TUNiT football boot concept,  which offer consumers the
opportunity to specify certain product features. 


 broad selection of well-defined product families such
as adiSTAR,  adiZero and Supernova and technologies such
as Clima,  TECHFIT™,  ForMotion™ and BOUNCE™,  offering
consumers extensive choice,  according to their individually
defined needs and requirements. 
In marketing and distribution,  personalization includes providing tailor-made offerings be it online or in stores.  Personalization will be the brand's lead innovation concept and a
driving force of the adidas business going forward.  It will guide
all efforts in product design and development,  (digital) marketing and distribution.

history or stronger connection with sport than adidas.  Everything at adidas reflects the spirit of its founder Adi Dassler. 
That means adidas intends to support and equip all athletes
in the best possible way to help them achieve their optimal
performance.  Therefore,  adidas Sport Performance remains
the brand's primary focus both in terms of product and brand
initiatives.  The division will continue to generate at least 70 %
of adidas brand revenues going forward.  Although the adidas
Sport Performance division offers products in almost every
sports category,  the key priorities are:


Running
Football
Basketball
Training 
In all these areas,  adidas strives to be the leading global brand
in terms of sales.  80 % of revenue growth in the Sport Performance division between now and 2010 is expected to come
from these four categories.  Additionally,  adidas plans to further extend its global market leadership position in the tennis
category going forward. 
adidas aims to consistently present the brand attitude 'Impossible is Nothing" in targeted and relevant consumer communication.  The 'Impossible is Nothing" brand campaign
encourages consumers to achieve their own personal 'impossible" goals no matter what they might be and underlines
that adidas will help them in their pursuit of these goals. 

SPORT PERFORMANCE RUNNING: BUILDING CREDIBILITY
WITH HIGH-PERFORMANCE ATHLETES Running continues to
be adidas' highest category priority and will be critical to the
brand's success moving forward.  Because of the category's
global importance,  the brand is committed to support running
with a substantial portion of overall marketing spend now in
both event and non-event years.  adidas holds the number two
position in terms of sales in the category globally. 
The brand's philosophy is to inspire and enable runners on all
levels.  adidas focuses on building credibility with the highperformance athlete first because for the brand this credibility
is the foundation for eventually tapping into the broader opportunity in the running category,  the casual runner.  As runners
tend to seek consistency and proven technologies,  the adidas
product range is built on several well-established product
families that address specific consumer needs (e.  g.  adiSTARSupernova,  Response,  adiZero,  BOUNCE™).  By segmenting
and tailoring distribution,  supporting retail partners and
utilizing partnerships with selected global marathon events
(e.  g.  the Boston,  London and Berlin Marathons),  the brand
expects to leverage its product offering globally and further
strengthen its position in the running market. 

SPORT PERFORMANCE FOOTBALL: INCREASING THE
BRAND'S LEADERSHIP POSITION Being the most popular
sport worldwide,  football is clearly one of adidas' key strategic
priorities.  For over 50 years,  adidas has led all major developments in football boot technology and balls.  adidas is the
world's leading football brand in terms of sales.  Building on its
success around the 2006 FIFA World Cup™,  the brand strives
to increase its leadership position by continuously creating the
industry's top products and fully leveraging its outstanding
portfolio of promotion partners. 

047

Promotion partners include leading football associations
(e.  g.  FIFA,  UEFA),  national federations (e.  g.  Germany,  FranceSpain,  Romania,  Greece,  Argentina,  Mexico,  Japan),  leagues
(e.  g.  Major League Soccer in the USA),  clubs (e.  g.  Real MadridA.  C.  Milan,  Chelsea FC,  Liverpool FC,  FC Bayern Munich,  River
Plate) and individual players (e.  g.  Kaká,  Lionel Messi,  David
Beckham,  Michael Ballack).  In 2007,  adidas' momentum in the
category continued and the brand further strengthened its
global market position. 
In 2008,  most product and marketing efforts will revolve around
the European Football Championship (UEFA EURO 2008™)which represents a key platform for the brand in Europe.  The
event also has a significant global relevance,  evoking strong
interest among football fans worldwide.  Based on new product
and marketing concepts plus a proven strength in translating
those into commercial success,  adidas expects to extend its
leadership in the category going forward.

SPORT PERFORMANCE BASKETBALL: LEVERAGING THE
NBA PARTNERSHIP adidas is the number two brand in terms
of basketball category sales worldwide with a strong presence
outside of North America.  Increasing its footprint in basketball
therefore represents another key component of the adidas
brand strategy.  In particular,  basketball is a key category to
drive growth in North America.  adidas intends to strengthen its
position in the category by emphasizing the brand's unique
positioning with a clear focus on individual and team performance. 
In this context,  the brand's long-term partnership with the
NBA is a critical asset.  This agreement includes exclusive
licensing rights to all NBA on-court and warm-up apparel as
well as NBA-branded footwear for all teams.  It also ensures
adidas' visibility at all 2460 NBA games and allows the brand
to effectively promote and harness its outstanding roster of
individual players such as Kevin Garnett,  Dwight Howard,  Tim
Duncan,  Chauncey Billups,  Tracy McGrady and Gilbert Arenas. 
see adidas Products and Campaigns,  p.  129 Over 20 % of all NBA players
today wear adidas footwear. 
Due to the NBA's increasing visibility and popularity around the
globe,  the partnership represents an important vehicle to drive
the adidas basketball business in Asia and Europe.  The portion
of adidas basketball sales generated outside of North America
is growing rapidly.  As a result,  the brand's overall basketball
business is expected to be split evenly between North America
and international markets by 2010. 
SPORT PERFORMANCE TRAINING: EXPANDING THE MEN'S
AND WOMEN'S APPAREL BUSINESSES Training is the
industry's largest apparel category.  At adidas,  training is the
single biggest sports category for both men and women and
one of the adidas brand's key strengths.  Moreover,  adidas is
the global leader in training apparel and strives to extend
this leadership position going forward. 

In the men's segment,  adidas' cross-category performancedriven compression apparel concept TECHFIT™ see adidas
Products and Campaigns,  p.  129 represents a key image and commercial
driver.  The brand expects to expand the TECHFIT™ business in
2008 on the back of strong communication and sports marketing support.  In addition,  adidas will work closely with key
retailers and support them with a quick replenishment and
 never-out-of-stock" program. 
adidas has identified women's training as one of its most
important growth opportunities.  see Risk and Opportunity Report,  p.  104
Therefore,  adidas intends to further grow the business with
extended product offerings in the high-end adilibria,  the danceinspired Fuse and the gym-focused Clima 365™ collections. 
In addition,  to support these product concepts,  adidas will run
 global communication campaign centered around yoga. 
The brand will also continue to carefully extend the product
offering and distribution of its acclaimed adidas by Stella
McCartney range. 
SPORT STYLE: CAPITALIZING ON BRAND AUTHENTICITY AND
HERITAGE The market for streetwear and lifestyle fashion
represents a unique opportunity for sporting goods companies
as it is more fragmented and larger in size than the market for
products used in sports activity.  In addition,  profitability in the
sports lifestyle market is typically higher as a result of lower
 & D expenses.  Further,  the sports lifestyle market is growing
faster than the market for actual sports products. 
adidas is a brand with an authentic sports lifestyle offering
based on its unique sport heritage.  This distinction offers
adidas a clear advantage when competing with the numerous
fashion brands which are attempting to enter this market.  To
best tap the potential of the sports lifestyle market,  adidas
created a dedicated Sport Style division primarily focused on
its Originals and fashion (e.  g.  Y-3,  Porsche Design) businesses. 
In 2008,  adidas plans to further strengthen its lifestyle proposition with the addition of a separate lifestyle fashion program
targeting more commercial price points.  The Sport Style
division is expected to account for up to 30 % of adidas brand
sales in the medium to long term. 

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR GROUP - Structure and Strategy  adidas Strategy 
SPORT STYLE: EXPANDING ADIDAS ORIGINALS The adidas
Originals business is the cornerstone of the Sport Style division. 
Brand communication and attitude of adidas Originals are built
on the message 'Celebrate Originality".  see adidas Products and
Campaigns,  p.  129 All product and marketing initiatives at adidas
Originals focus on authenticity,  creativity and individuality. 
Since its introduction,  adidas Originals has been positioned
as a niche business with corresponding product,  marketing
and distribution strategies.  Going forward,  however,  adidas
Originals will widen distribution and extend its product offering
and communication efforts.  In this way,  adidas Originals plans
to fully capitalize on the strength and brand equity of adidas. 
To best meet the needs of a wide consumer base,  adidas
Originals addresses three consumer segments:


The Metropolitan consumer looks to sport,  street and fashion
references as a basis for self-expression.  In this consumer
segment,  adidas will build on key trends such as driving-inspired
and low-profile footwear (e.  g.  Sleek for women).  Furthermoreadidas will launch its first jeans collection as part of the
new product collaboration with Diesel in 2008.  Moreoveradidas will extend its product offering with the introduction
of new product concepts such as the environmentally-friendly
adidas Grün and the women-specific Handbags for Feet
collections.  see adidas Products and Campaigns,  p.  129


The Urban segment presents a bold,  urban look that takes
references from sport,  street and particularly hip hop lifestyle. 
In this consumer segment,  authenticity and heritage are
critical.  adidas was a pioneer in this segment with its connection to music artists Run DMC in the 1980s.  Today,  adidas
continues to resonate with urban consumers with the iconic
Superstar shoe or product ranges related to its partnerships
with Missy Elliott and the NBA (i.  e.  lifestyle basketball products). 

ANNUAL REPORT 2007 -- adidas Group 

In the Coastal segment,  adidas targets a young consumer
group inspired by action sports.  This includes a continued
focus on the brand's successful skateboarding-inspired
product offering. 
To ensure future sales growth in the sports lifestyle marketadidas will offer new concepts and at the same time further
differentiate and segment distribution at wholesale and in
adidas own-retail stores. 
SPORT STYLE: BUILDING A FASHION BUSINESS ON THE SUCCESS OF Y-3 Another key element in the Sport Style division is
the high-end Y-3 fashion collection developed in collaboration
with designer Yohji Yamamoto.  Introduced five years ago,  the
Y-3 business has grown substantially and has become a key
image driver for the adidas brand.  Through Y-3,  adidas has
created its own niche in the highly competitive world of fashion. 
New collections are launched twice a year at the New York
fashion week.  To drive the Y-3 business worldwide,  adidas
focuses on controlled space initiatives with high-end retailers
as well as own-retail activities.  In 2008,  adidas expects to
grow sales in the fashion category at a double-digit rate. 
OPTIMIZING WHOLESALE BUSINESS Success in both Sport
Performance and Sport Style requires an effective distribution
strategy.  The right presentation and availability of consumerrelevant product as well as excellent customer service at the
point-of-sale are critical in this context. 
adidas generates around 83 % of its revenues through its
wholesale business where adidas sales subsidiaries sell
footwear,  apparel and hardware/accessories to retail partners. 
In general,  the brand's customers include sporting goodssport specialty,  athletic specialty and family footwear retailers
as well as high-end department stores and directional
accounts in the Sport Style division.  To preserve the premium
image of the adidas brand,  it generally does not sell its products to value or discount chains. 

In a few markets,  where adidas does not have its own sales
subsidiaries,  the brand partners with third-party distributors
that sell its products to retail.  To have maximum brand controlhowever,  adidas' strategy is to continuously buy back distribution rights and establish own sales organizations as appropriate.  see Risk and Opportunity Report,  p.  104
In 2008,  adidas will also continue to optimize its wholesale
proposition by further segmenting its product offering to retailers.  After the successful introduction of the new distribution
model in the UK,  the brand plans to roll out similar models in
other major European markets. 
EXPANDING CONTROLLED SPACE In line with the Group's
distribution strategy,  see Group Strategy,  p.  044 the adidas brand
focuses on the expansion of controlled space:


By further growing its own-retail business and extending
the mono-branded store network particularly in emerging
markets 
By diversifying its own store formats and establishing a
multi-dimensional store portfolio comprising Metropolitan
stores,  concept stores,  e-commerce and factory outlets,  and 

By accelerating its roll-out of shop-in-shops with key retail
partners in mature markets. 
In 2007,  adidas made significant progress in all these areas. 
The brand's own-retail sales and store number continued to
increase strongly.  Own retail now accounts for 17 % of adidas
brand revenues.  see adidas Business Performance,  p.  096 The number
of mono-branded stores in emerging markets and the number
of shop-in-shops also grew significantly. 

In 2008,  adidas plans to further extend its controlled space
initiatives.  Together with its retailer partners,  the brand will
continue to open shop-in-shop formats in mature markets and
new mono-branded stores in emerging markets.  In markets
with an underdeveloped retail landscape and where market
access via partners is not possible,  adidas plans to further
extend its own-retail business. 

049

As part of the continued growth of its own-store network,  the
adidas brand will open its largest store in the world in Beijing
in spring 2008,  which will showcase both Sport Performance
and Sport Style products.  Going forward,  the brand expects
to introduce more such Metropolitan stores as appropriate. 
adidas will also further diversify its store base introducing
category-specific concept store formats.  Moreover,  the brand
will pilot its first European online shop in the Netherlands in
the first half of 2008. 
GROWING AVERAGE SELLING PRICES AND PROFITABILITY
adidas offers the vast majority of its footwear,  apparel and
hardware products at high- and mid-level price points.  The
brand's goal is to strengthen both its market position and revenues by driving continuous growth in average selling prices
and increasing profitability.  adidas believes a strong brand
image is the best defense against a promotional retail environment (i.  e.  competition at retail via price wars) and is prepared
to give up short-term revenue opportunities as necessary to
preserve the long-term market position.  see Risk and Opportunity

REEBOK STRATEGY

'always challenge and lead through creativity". 
The idea of fit and comfort is at the core of all
product development.  Reebok is a consumerdriven brand with a balanced sales split
between sport and lifestyle.  Women's and
running are the brand's two global category
priorities alongside several regional initiatives
to drive growth worldwide.  Building the
branded apparel business and recalibrating its
lifestyle offering are other strategic priorities
for the brand. 

SIGNIFICANT ORGANIZATIONAL AND OPERATIONAL PROGRESS In 2007,  the main focus at Reebok was on laying the
groundwork for a sustainable revitalization of the Reebok
brand going forward.  While financial results were mixedsee Reebok Business Performance,  p.  099 significant organizational
progress was made.  During the year,  new regional heads
were put in charge in North America,  Europe and Asia with
the appointment of Matt O'Toole (North America),  Nigel
Griffiths (Europe) and David Mischler (Asia).  Michael Rupp
was also appointed President and CEO of the Rockport brand
effective January 1,  2008. 

Reebok also made progress with several brand marketing
initiatives.  With the addition of tennis star Jelena Jankovic and
the global sponsorship agreement for the 2008 Avon Walk
Around the World for Breast Cancer,  see Reebok Products and
Campaigns,  p.  138 the brand further strengthened its partnership
portfolio in the women's business.  Regarding brand communication,  Reebok ran its largest fully-integrated global running
campaign: 'Run Easy".  This campaign highlighted the camaraderie,  joy and fun of running.  And in China,  the brand launched
its 'Fuel Yao's Unlimited Power" campaign for the Beijing
Olympics featuring basketball star Yao Ming. 

In North America,  Reebok took important steps in improving
its distribution mix by cleaning inventories and strengthening
relationships with retailers in the sporting goods channel. 
 strong presence in this distribution channel is critical to
strengthen credibility as a sports brand.  Reebok also proactively started to limit distribution in the mall-based athletic
specialty retail channel by solely accepting at-once orders
from one major account.  see Risk and Opportunity Report,  p.  104 The
Sports Licensed Division,  an adidas Group unit which focuses
on licensed apparel for both adidas and Reebok,  acquired the
assets of Mitchell & Ness Nostalgia Company,  a wholesalermarketer and distributor of authentic vintage athletic product
effective October 31,  2007 (transaction value: low-single-digit
million euro amount).  The acquisition offers Reebok further
sales potential and helps the brand strengthen its position in
the sports licensed business. 

BECOMING 'THE BRAND THAT FITS ME" As a consumerdriven brand,  Reebok commits to offer the 'perfect fit" for
consumers.  On the one hand,  this implies designing and developing products with materials,  styles and technologies that
enhance fit and comfort for consumers.  In 2007,  for exampleReebok developed 893 fit initiatives to be included in products
for the spring / summer collection 2008.  Highlight products are
footwear and apparel featuring KineticFit technology.  see
Research and Development,  p.  072 On the other hand,  it means
addressing consumers in a personal,  engaging way so that
they can better identify with the brand.  Reebok's 2008 global
brand campaign 'Your Move" stresses the fact that consumers have a choice and that Reebok is the brand that best
understands and meets their needs.  see Reebok Products and 
In addition,  Reebok made significant organizational headway
outside of North America.  The brand's European Headquarters
relocated from Bolton (UK) to Amsterdam (Netherlands).  This
move was initiated to sharpen the brand's focus on the region's
traditional and emerging markets and to improve range merchandising.  During the year,  Reebok also bought back distribution rights in Turkey and Greece,  effective April 1,  2007 and
January 1,  2008,  respectively. 

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR GROUP - Structure and Strategy  Reebok Strategy 
Campaigns,  p.  138

However,  the concept of fit is not only a product and marketing
philosophy.  Instead it should guide all facets of the brand's
business.  Reebok's intent is to be 'the brand that fits me".  That
means meeting the needs of consumers,  promotional partners,  retailers and employees.  With a 'perfect fit" distribution
strategy,  Reebok intends to offer the right product for the right
accounts at the right margins.  Moreover,  Reebok is committed
to building a work environment that matches the need of its
employees and to hiring people who fit the brand's values. 

ANNUAL REPORT 2007 -- adidas Group 
ENGAGING CONSUMERS THROUGH CUSTOMIZATION Customization is an increasingly important priority for the Reebok
brand.  With technologies such as KineticFit and The Pump™Reebok provides consumers customization elements in its
products.  Reebok also offers North American consumers the
opportunity to design their own shoes through its web-based
customization platform 'Rbk Custom".  The brand's product
offerings on the website also include limited editions of highlight products such as shoes created by famous graphic
designer John Maeda and the Freestyle.  In 2008,  Reebok will
expand its product offering available via 'Rbk Custom" and
also extend the platform's reach to European countries. 
Further,  Reebok will offer key directional retailers the possibility to order customized products on quick delivery timelines
(i.  e.  60 days).  Reebok also increasingly interacts with consumers on a personal level,  utilizing predominately digital
marketing initiatives.  Going forward,  the brand will take a digital leadership role by extending both its customized product
initiatives and digital marketing activities.  Reebok will launch
 new digital platform in 2008,  which will feature some of the
latest developments in personalization technology. 
BALANCING SPORT AND LIFESTYLE Most brands in the
sporting goods industry define themselves as either a sport or
 lifestyle player.  Reebok has a heritage within the industry
based on products that bridge the gap between sport and lifestyle.  The brand therefore puts equal emphasis on developing
products for sports activities and daily life.  With a holistic
approach across all categories,  Reebok addresses different
consumer groups from the active athlete to the sports fanfrom the urban to the suburban consumer.  To grow its sport
business going forward,  Reebok has defined two global category priorities: women's and running.  In addition,  the brand
has also set regional priorities such as American sports
(North America) and football (Europe and Latin America). 
At the same time,  Reebok is sharpening its lifestyle focus by
broadening and upgrading its product offering. 

WOMEN'S: LEVERAGING REEBOK'S HERITAGE Reebok enjoys
 distinctive position in the women's market.  As the brand that
virtually invented the aerobics category in the 1980s,  Reebok
has an unrivalled heritage in serving the unique needs of
female athletes.  The brand continues to hold leading global
positions in important women's categories such as workout
and walking. 

AMERICAN SPORTS: CAPITALIZING ON LEAGUE PARTNERSHIPS Reebok's activities in American sports aim to underline
Reebok's positioning as an American-inspired brand.  This is
an important regional initiative in North America but also a
differentiating factor versus competitors in the rest of the
world.  American football and baseball are critical categories
to strengthen the brand's credibility in sport. 

Going forward,  Reebok intends to further strengthen its profile
in the women's market.  As fit is particularly important to
women,  Reebok is introducing new materials and colors as
well as women-specific patterns and size schemes in its
product lines.  With targeted marketing concepts and partnerships with top athletes (e.  g.  Amélie Mauresmo,  Carolina KlüftNicole Vaidisova) and celebrities,  the brand will show that it
fully understands the unique needs of the female consumer. 
Reebok's partnership with the 2008 Avon Walk Around the
World for Breast Cancer illustrates the brand's strong commitment to women and will help build a connection with consumers worldwide.  see Reebok Products and Campaigns,  p.  138

Due to its partnership with the NFL,  Reebok has a unique position in American football,  the most popular sport in the USA. 
As the official outfitter of the NFL,  Reebok provides on-field
uniforms as well as off-field apparel products to all 32 NFL
teams.  This gives Reebok an unrivalled presence at all NFL
games during the season.  In addition,  the partnership enables
Reebok to drive its licensed business and has a positive halo
effect on the brand's cleated footwear and branded apparel
business.  By utilizing individual players such as Peyton and
Eli Manning and Vince Young as brand ambassadors,  Reebok
strives to strengthen its connection with consumers. 

RUNNING: TARGETING NEW AND RECREATIONAL RUNNERS
Running is the sport with the highest participation level and
the most diverse consumer base worldwide.  Reebok's positioning in the category differs from that of most brands. 
Instead of focusing first on the competitive athlete,  Reebok
clearly targets new and recreational runners. 

Reebok is also committed to further building its position in
baseball and basketball.  In baseball,  the brand utilizes its
partnerships with Major League Baseball (MLB) and David
Ortiz to drive sales in both sport and lifestyle.  By utilizing
the Pump custom-fit footwear technology and further capitalizing on key partnerships with individual players such as
Allen Iverson and Yao Ming,  Reebok also intends to grow in
the basketball category. 

In 2008 and beyond,  Reebok's product offering in the running
category will focus on fit and comfort.  In this context,  the
Hex Ride Rally running shoe clearly represents the highlight
product.  see Reebok Products and Campaigns,  p.  138 Reebok remains
committed to developing comprehensive running ranges and
establishing itself as a 'head-to-toe" running brand. 
To adequately support its product initiatives and to further
underline its unique running positioning,  Reebok's brand
communication will feature running as a priority category. 
To increase traction in the category,  Reebok also engages in
grassroot activities around smaller,  local running events.

FOOTBALL: COMPETING AS A NICHE PLAYER Football is the
most popular sport worldwide and of particular importance in
Europe and Latin America.  Therefore,  Reebok intends to tackle
the football market in these regions by becoming a credible
niche player in the category.  The brand's product offering in
football (including footwear,  apparel and hardware) revolves
around fit and comfort.  To support business development and
connect with consumers in Europe,  Reebok partners with a
limited number of standout footballers such as Thierry HenryAndriy Shevchenko and Iker Casillas.  Reebok's brand communication initiatives across Europe not only highlight the athletic
abilities of these players but also present facets from their life
off the pitch.  In this way,  Reebok intends to directly address
football consumers and to build brand awareness.  In Latin
America,  the brand utilizes sponsorship agreements with
popular football clubs such as Chivas,  São Paulo FC and Internacional Porto Alegre to resonate with consumers. 

SHARPENING LIFESTYLE PROPOSITION Catering to sports
lifestyle consumers continues to be an important pillar of
Reebok's strategy.  In the past,  the brand's lifestyle business
was overly reliant on certain products,  particularly in the
Classics footwear segment.  To limit the risk of overdependence on single styles and build a broad-based lifestyle business,  Reebok is currently refining and widening its product
range. 
Going forward,  Reebok will continue to partner with entertainers,  actors and artists to appeal to a variety of consumers
and to stress individuality in the product offering.  In 2008Reebok will introduce several new lifestyle concepts (e.  g.  the
Kool-Aid and Voltron collections) but also new variations of
popular existing concepts (e.  g.  Classics,  Freestyle). 

BUILDING THE BRANDED APPAREL BUSINESS With respect
to apparel,  Reebok's current strength clearly is the licensed
apparel business.  Therefore,  building its branded apparel business is a key priority for the brand and is targeted to deliver
annual incremental sales of € 100 million by 2009 as part of
the Reebok integration into the adidas Group.  see Outlook,  p.  118
Technological innovation,  design and a well-functioning supply
chain are critical success factors in the branded apparel
category.  Expanding its apparel technology platform is a key
Reebok priority.  This includes greater commercialization of the
brand's 'Play Dry" concept.  The new KineticFit apparel technology will also be launched in 2008.  By creating global ranges
that include region-specific executions,  Reebok aims to evolve
into a credible and competitive market player in the branded
apparel category.  Therefore,  Reebok is currently revamping its
product design and development processes adopting adidas
best practices where appropriate.  It also includes utilizing
adidas' sourcing and supply chain infrastructure.

Reebok-CCM Hockey holds the number one position in terms
of global sales in the hockey category,  combining two leading
brands: Rbk Hockey and CCM.  Both offer a complete range
of hockey equipment and apparel.  Rbk Hockey and CCM are
positioned with two differentiated ''head-to-toe' brand platforms.  CCM is placing emphasis on the skates category while
Rbk Hockey is focusing on hockey sticks and apparel.  Product
development and design initiatives at Reebok-CCM Hockey
focus on technologically-advanced,  performance-enhancing
equipment.  see Research and Development,  p.  072 Going forwardReebok-CCM Hockey will continue to develop and further
improve its industry-leading products such as the Rbk EDGE

enables Reebok-CCM Hockey to drive its licensed business. 
Further,  Reebok-CCM Hockey partners with top players
including Sidney Crosby,  Alexander Ovechkin and Vincent
Lecavalier.  These partnerships with individual key players
underline Reebok-CCM Hockey's leadership position in hockey
and also provide a commercial opportunity in the form of
licensed apparel sales or signature collections.  As a result of
its strong product offering and partnership portfolio,  ReebokCCM Hockey expects to further strengthen its leadership position going forward.

ROCKPORT: EXPANDING IN THE CASUAL LIFESTYLE MARKET
Rockport is a leading global,  lifestyle footwear brand.  It combines modern and stylish design with advanced comfort and
performance technologies derived from the athletic footwear
industry to provide a unique competitive advantage. 
From a category perspective,  Rockport has major growth
initiatives targeted at the urban/metro,  outdoor,  technologyoriented and women's segments of the casual lifestyle market. 
The brand strives to connect with many different consumer
groups through a well-defined product segmentation,  a disciplined channel-specific distribution strategy and the continued
incorporation of industry-leading technologies such as adidas
TORSION® into its product.  Leveraging the Group's infrastructure (e.  g.  in emerging markets) is also a core element
in Rockport's growth strategy.  The brand expects to continue to
grow its North American business while achieving increased
sales internationally (i.  e.  outside of North America) going forward.  By 2010,  more than 50 % of Rockport sales are expected
to be generated in Europe,  Asia and Latin America. 
OPTIMIZING EXISTING DISTRIBUTION The wholesale business
accounts for 84 % of total sales in the Reebok segment.  Historically,  Reebok's distribution base has been rather narrowcomprising only certain channels (i.  e.  athletic specialty and
family footwear) and a small number of customers.  This distribution approach created an overdependence on,  and an overexposure to,  particular retail partners.  Subsequently,  Reebok's
bargaining power and brand image were negatively affected.  In
line with the Group's approach to diversify distribution,  Reebok
is now broadening its distribution mix and increasing its presence in other retail formats (e.  g.  sporting goods and department stores) in order to:


In addition,  Reebok increasingly differentiates its product
assortment amongst retailers to best meet the needs of various
consumer groups.  The core distribution channels for ReebokCCM Hockey are specialist stores and sporting goods retailers. 
Rockport products are primarily sold in department stores
and the family footwear channel.  By segmenting the brand and
differentiating the product offering available for retailersRockport ensures a broad-based distribution of its products. 
GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH CONTROLLED SPACE
Reebok increasingly focuses on the roll-out of shop-in-shops
with retail partners in mature markets,  while expanding
its own-store base as well as its mono-branded store network
in emerging markets.  In the near-term future,  factory outlets
will remain the most important format within Reebok's ownretail strategy in North America.  Reebok-CCM Hockey mainly
focuses on working closely with partners such as the NHL to
establish jointly managed co-branded stores. 
Building on its 2007 momentum (e.  g.  store openings in Russia
and China),  Rockport is expanding its own concept store base
(particularly in emerging markets) and increasing its efforts
in partnering with retailers via shop-in-shops.  Further,  Reebok
and Rockport are significantly extending their e-commerce
platforms to make the online channel another important
element of their distribution mix.  Overall,  own retail accounts

three continue to work with third-party distributors in many
markets.  To better control brand management and gain market share,  Reebok and Rockport continue to buy back distribution rights for the Reebok and Rockport brands or wait until
expiration of existing agreements with distribution partners to
eventually set up their own sales organizations.  The buyback of
distribution rights offers additional sales potential and represents the most important area of Reebok revenue synergies.

INCREASING AVERAGE SELLING PRICES To reinforce its position as a premium sports and lifestyle brand,  Reebok's goal is
to significantly improve and increase its product offering at
high- and mid-price points to drive growth in average selling
prices.  This approach may slow short-term top-line development by voluntarily foregoing commercial opportunities in the
low-price segment.  More importantly,  however,  it enables
Reebok to build a platform for sustainable sales and profitability growth and preserves the brand's image. 
As a leading manufacturer and marketer of technologicallyadvanced hockey equipment,  Reebok-CCM Hockey primarily
targets high-price points.  By further strengthening its innovation leadership,  Reebok-CCM Hockey intends to preserve its
high average selling prices.  The Rockport brand predominately
competes at high- and mid-price points.  To increase competitiveness in these price segments,  the brand is committed to
continuously incorporating advanced technologies into its products,  making technology its main selling proposition.

TAYLORMADE-ADIDAS GOLF STRATEGY
TaylorMade-adidas Golf's mission is to be the
leading performance golf company in the
world in terms of sales and profitability. 
It combines two of golf's strongest brands:
TaylorMade (focused on clubs and balls) and
adidas Golf (focused on footwear and apparel). 
Both brands are dedicated to continuously
developing and commercializing innovativetechnologically advanced products.  To
accomplish its goal,  TaylorMade-adidas Golf
has set its sights on five strategic priorities:
extending its leadership in metalwoodssignificantly expanding its golf ball businessmaximizing growth at adidas Golf,  driving
marketing excellence and further strengthening
its distribution mix. 

CAPITALIZING ON THE STRONG MARKET POSITIONS OF TWO
WELL-ESTABLISHED BRANDS TaylorMade-adidas Golf maintains two well-defined golf brands with strong market positions
under one roof.  TaylorMade is the market leader in terms of
sales in the metalwoods category and is among the leading iron
brands.  In addition,  TaylorMade is also steadily evolving into a
leading golf ball manufacturer.  adidas Golf has delivered outstanding sales growth in both footwear and apparel during the
past five years and has clearly become the fastest-growing golf
footwear and apparel brand in terms of sales and market
share in major golf markets.  TaylorMade-adidas Golf is committed to further growing its business in a profitable way
and improving its market position by harnessing the R & D
strength see Research and Development,  p.  072 and brand equity of both
TaylorMade and adidas Golf. 

EXTENDING LEADERSHIP IN METALWOODS Today,  TaylorMade
is the clear market leader in metalwoods  particularly in the
USA,  where the brand's market share of approximately 28 %
has created a substantial gap between TaylorMade and its
strongest competitor.  This success was driven by the brand's
ability to continuously introduce and commercialize new and
innovative products.  Therefore,  the brand's primary focus going
forward is to maintain its place in the market as the innovation
leader and to further expand its metalwoods business outside
the USA.  By strengthening its promotion partnerships in other
regions (e.  g.  new partnerships with Korean golfer Ye Yang and
the China Golf Association in Asia),  TaylorMade plans to support its international expansion in the metalwoods category.  By
2010,  the brand's goal is to achieve a similarly strong market
position on a global scale as in the USA. 

INCREASED INNOVATION FOCUS TaylorMade-adidas Golf's
core principle is to create the best performance golf products
in the marketplace,  and that starts with a clear commitment
to innovation,  technology and Tour leadership.  The brand
strives to extend its leadership position with a continued focus
on innovation. 

GROWING GOLF BALL BUSINESS BY FURTHER GAINING TOUR
CREDIBILITY Success in golf balls depends on the ability to
create high-performance golf balls,  bring them to market and
build credibility among Tour professionals.  Over the last three
years,  TaylorMade-adidas Golf has restructured its golf ball
business to lay the groundwork for a prosperous future in this
product category.  The brand purchased numerous patents
with the acquisition of Maxfli in 2003 and created its own ball
division that is fully dedicated to developing high-qualitytechnologically-advanced performance golf balls. 

To remain at the forefront,  TaylorMade-adidas Golf is intensifying its R & D efforts.  For example,  TaylorMade created an
independent innovation team that is solely focused on identifying
potential new product concepts and designs,  primarily in metalwoods and irons,  that may subsequently be transformed into
product development by the general R & D team.  adidas Golf
continues to leverage adidas' R & D capabilities,  transforming
innovative adidas concepts and technologies into golf footwear
and apparel products.  TaylorMade-adidas Golf strives to introduce at least one major new product innovation or evolution
every 12 to 18 months. 

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR GROUP - Structure and Strategy  TaylorMade-adidas Golf Strategy 
TaylorMade successfully introduced its TP Red and TP Black
golf balls in 2006,  which together now comprise the second
most-played ball models on the European,  Nationwide and
Japan Tours.  In this way,  TaylorMade has established itself as a
credible golf ball brand among professionals and highly skilled
players.  In 2007,  the number of marquee players using the TP
Red and TP Black golf balls further increased.  Among new
additions to the portfolio of players were Retief Goosen,  Fred
Funk,  Sean O'Hair,  Darren Clarke and Natalie Gulbis.  The
brand intends to increase sales in the golf ball category by
extending the TaylorMade branded offering and further leveraging the successful NOODLE franchise. 

ANNUAL REPORT 2007 -- adidas Group 
Going forward,  the golf ball division will be supported with
additional personnel and financial resources to drive growth. 
In addition,  TaylorMade plans to further grow the number of
players on the Tour using its golf balls,  thereby gaining stronger
acceptance in the marketplace. 
BUILDING ON ADIDAS GOLF'S STRENGTH IN FOOTWEAR AND
APPAREL As a result of its steady commitment to developing
great-looking,  great-feeling and performance-enhancing products,  adidas Golf has been the fastest-growing footwear and
apparel brand in golf for the last three years. 
With the introduction of industry-leading high-performance
golf shoes such as the TOUR360,  the TOUR360 II and the
POWERBAND,  adidas Golf has developed into a strong competitor in the global golf footwear market.  In 2007,  adidas Golf
for a short period even became the top-selling footwear brand
in Japan.  This was the first time ever that a non-domestic
brand had taken over market leadership in a product category
in Japan,  which is the world's second largest golf market. 
adidas Golf intends to extend its position in golf footwear in the
medium term by further leveraging adidas' strength in footwear technologies and by building on its successful TOUR360
and POWERBAND franchises. 
In apparel,  adidas Golf has positioned itself as the most
innovative performance brand in the game by utilizing adidas
ClimaCool®,  ClimaCool® Motion,  Clima Compression and
ClimaProof® technologies in adidas Golf apparel products. 
adidas Golf was the first major brand to bring these types of
technology to the golf industry,  making it the front-runner in
terms of technological innovation in the golf apparel category. 
Going forward,  adidas Golf is committed to growing its apparel
business by continuously incorporating leading adidas apparel
technologies into golf products.  In this way,  the brand expects
to achieve clear global market leadership in the category in the
medium term. 

MARKETING EXCELLENCE AS A KEY SUCCESS FACTOR Wellcoordinated and consumer-relevant marketing is paramount
to achieving sustainable market leadership.  For this reasonTaylorMade-adidas Golf has combined product marketingbrand communication and retail marketing in one fullyintegrated global marketing team.  Executional excellence
and a coordinated approach to bringing product to market are
key elements of the segment's go-to-market strategy. 
TaylorMade-adidas Golf utilizes a variety of strong marketing
tools.  Following product launches,  TaylorMade-adidas Golf
provides point-of-sale support,  in-store communication and
customer flow management support (e.  g.  assistance in
reducing waiting times for consumers) to drive product sellthrough.  TaylorMade's Tour Trailers are on-site at nearly all
PGA Tour and European Tour golf tournaments to give Tour
professionals the opportunity to interact with TaylorMade
product specialists.  Leadership on these Tours strengthens
TaylorMade-adidas Golf's credibility among golfers and helps
both brands increase traction among consumers.  Furtherefficient product lifecycle management plays an important role
in helping TaylorMade-adidas Golf achieve optimal results in
the marketplace.  In summary,  marketing expertise and excellence are critical tools to help TaylorMade-adidas Golf drive
sustainable growth going forward. 
FURTHER EXTENDING AND SEGMENTING DISTRIBUTION
TaylorMade-adidas Golf works with retail partners who possess the skills to effectively showcase the performance advantages of TaylorMade and adidas Golf products.  Core channels
include green grass retailers,  off-course golf specialty retailers and sporting goods retail formats with golf-specific departments.  By focusing on strategic and key accounts (golf
specialty and sporting goods retailers) in the distribution mixTaylorMade-adidas Golf has positioned TaylorMade metalwoods and irons,  and adidas Golf footwear and apparel to be
among the top-selling golf products in these retail channels. 

TaylorMade-adidas Golf will continue to work closely with its
strategic accounts.  The company also plans to increase its
efforts to extend its brands' presence at smaller retailers and
on-course golf shops,  where the brands are currently underrepresented.  This will help TaylorMade-adidas Golf steadily
grow its business going forward.  To support growth and at the
same time avoid overexposure to certain accounts or an oversupply in the market,  TaylorMade-adidas Golf pursues a selective distribution strategy based on a clear segmentation of its
product offering at retail.  The company also utilizes existing
adidas infrastructure,  particularly own-retail stores,  to distribute adidas Golf products and drive growth in emerging markets. 

055

PRICING STRATEGY REFLECTS BRAND POSITIONING
TaylorMade-adidas Golf's pricing policy mirrors the positioning
of its two brands in the golf market.  As a result,  TaylorMade's
pricing strategy focuses on dominating the market at premium
price points and competing aggressively in the high-volume
mid-price segment.  adidas Golf supports its market perception
as the innovation leader in performance golf footwear and
apparel by selling its products primarily at premium price
points. 
Market share expansion,  particularly in golf equipment,  is
driven mainly by the ability to deliver best-in-class lines
of products at multiple price points.  Two examples of
TaylorMade-adidas Golf's success with this strategy in golf
equipment are the Burner® (medium price) and r7®
SuperQuad (premium price) drivers: launched in 2007,  both
became the best-selling driver model in their respective price
segment in the US market.  The Burner® even was the bestselling driver worldwide in 2007.  Another example of a successful implementation of this strategy is adidas Golf's
high-priced TOUR360 golf shoe,  which became the brand's
best-selling golf shoe for two years running.

INTERNAL GROUP MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
The adidas Group's central planning and
controlling system is designed to continually
increase the value of our Group and brands
to maximize shareholder value.  By improving
our top- and bottom-line performance and
optimizing the use of capital employed,  we aim
to maximize free cash flow generation.  This is
our principal goal for increasing shareholder
value.  Management utilizes a variety of
decision-making tools to assess our current
performance and to align future strategic
and investment decisions to best utilize
commercial and organizational opportunities. 

FREE CASH FLOW AS INTERNAL GROUP MANAGEMENT
FOCUS The cornerstone of our Group's Internal Management
System is our focus on free cash flow generation,  which we
believe is the most important driver to sustain and increase
shareholder value.  Free cash flow is comprised of operating
components (operating profit,  change in operating working
capital and capital expenditure) as well as non-operating
components such as financial expenses and taxes.  To maximize free cash flow generation across our multi-brand organization,  brand management has direct responsibility for
improving operating profit as well as optimizing operating
working capital and capital expenditure.  Non-operating items
such as financial expenses and taxes are managed centrally
by the Group Treasury and Tax departments.  To keep Group and
brand management focused on ongoing performance improvement,  a portion of the responsible managers' total compensation is variable and linked to a combination of operating profitoperating working capital development,  Group earnings before
tax,  or relative / absolute stock price performance.

OPERATING MARGIN AS KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATOR
OF OPERATIONAL PROGRESS Operating margin (defined as
operating profit as a percentage of net sales) is our Group's
most important measure of operational success.  It highlights
the quality of our top-line and operational efficiency.  The
primary drivers central to enhancing operating margin are:


Sales and gross margin development: Management focuses
on identifying and exploiting opportunities that not only provide for future growth,  but also have potential to increase gross
margin (defined as gross profit as a percentage of net sales). 
Major levers for sustaining and enhancing our Group's sales
and gross margin include optimizing our product mixincreasing the quality of distribution with a particular focus
on controlled space as well as supply chain efficiency initiatives,  and the minimization of clearance activities. 


Operating expense control: Tight control of operating
expenses is particularly important as we strive to leverage the
Group's sales growth through to the bottom line.  Marketing
working budget is our largest operating expense.  It is one of
the most important mechanisms for driving top-line growth. 
Therefore,  we are committed to improving the utilization of
our marketing spend.  This includes concentrating our communication efforts (including advertising,  retail presentation and
public relations) on key global brand initiatives and focusing
our promotion spend on well-selected partnerships with top
events,  leagues,  clubs and athletes.  We also aim to increase
operational efficiency and reduce operating overhead expenses
as a percentage of sales.  Refining business processes,  eliminating redundancies and leveraging the scale of our organization are important drivers in this respect.

OPTIMIZATION OF NON-OPERATING COMPONENTS Our Group
also puts a high priority on the optimization of non-operating
components such as financial expenses and taxes,  as these
items strongly impact the Group's cash outflows and therefore
the Group's free cash flow.  Financial expenses are managed
centrally by our Group Treasury department.  see Treasury,  p.  091

TIGHT OPERATING WORKING CAPITAL MANAGEMENT Due to
 comparatively low level of fixed assets required in our business,  operating working capital management is a major focus
of our efforts to improve the efficiency of the Group's balance
sheet.  We have made major strides in this area through tight
working capital management focused on continuously improving our Group's inventories,  accounts receivable and accounts
payable. 
Our key metric is operating working capital as a percentage of
net sales.  Monitoring the development of this key metric facilitates the measurement of our progress in improving the efficiency of our business cycle.  We strive to manage our
inventory levels to meet market demand and ensure fast replenishment.  Inventory ageing is controlled to reduce inventory
obsolescence and to optimize clearance activities.  As a resultstock turn development is the key performance indicator as it
measures the number of times the average inventory is sold
during a year,  highlighting the amount of capital locked in
products in relation to our Group's business.  To minimize capital tied up in accounts receivable,  we strive to continuously
improve collection efforts in order to reduce the Days of Sales
Outstanding (DSO) and improve the ageing of accounts receivable.  Likewise,  we strive to continuously optimize payment
terms with our suppliers to best manage our accounts payable. 

CAPITAL EXPENDITURE TARGETED TO MAXIMIZE FUTURE
RETURNS Improving the effectiveness of the Group's capital
expenditure is another lever to maximize the Group's free cash
flow.  Our capital expenditure is controlled with a top-downbottom-up approach: In a first step,  Group Management
defines focus areas and an overall investment budget based
on investment requests by brand management.  Our operating
units then align their initiatives within the scope of assigned
priorities and available budget.  We evaluate potential return on
planned investments utilizing the net present value or internal
rate of return method,  in relation to the cost of capital.  Specific
investments are assessed according to the principles of riskweighted returns.  For large investment projects,  timelines and
deviations versus budget are monitored on a monthly basis
throughout the course of the project. 
 & A ACTIVITIES FOCUS ON LONG-TERM VALUE CREATION
POTENTIAL We expect the majority of our Group's growth to
come from organic business.  However,  as part of our commitment to ensuring sustainable profitable development,  we
regularly review merger and acquisition options that may provide additional commercial and operational opportunities. 
Acquisitive growth focus is primarily related to a potential for
increasing market penetration,  strengthening our Group's
positioning within a sports category or addressing new consumer segments.  The strategies of any potential acquisition
candidate must correspond with the Group's long-term
direction.  Maximizing return on invested capital above the cost
of capital is a core consideration in our decision-making process.  Of particular importance is evaluating the potential
impact on our Group's free cash flow.  We assess current and
future projected key financial metrics to evaluate a target's
contribution potential.  In addition,  careful consideration is
given to any potential financing implications which may be
required to complete a prospective acquisition. 

COST OF CAPITAL METRIC USED TO MEASURE INVESTMENT
POTENTIAL Creating value for our shareholders by earning a
return on invested capital above the cost of that capital is a
guiding principle of our Group strategy.  We source capital from
equity and debt markets.  Therefore,  we have a responsibility
that our return on capital meets the expectations of both equity
shareholders and creditors.  Our Group calculates the cost of
capital utilizing the weighted average cost of capital (WACC)
formula.  This metric allows us to calculate the minimum
required financial returns of planned capital investments.  The
cost of equity is computed utilizing the risk-free rate,  market
risk premium and beta.  Cost of debt is calculated using the
risk-free rate,  credit spread and average tax rate. 
STRUCTURED PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT SYSTEM Our
Group has developed an extensive performance measurement
system,  which utilizes a variety of tools to measure the performance of the adidas Group and our brand segments.  To
evaluate the Group's current sales and profitability development,  we monitor our annual budget on a monthly basisaddressing shortfalls and identifying additional opportunities. 
Further,  we monitor operating margin developments at all
brands on a monthly basis.  To optimize the Group's balance
sheet,  we control operating working capital movement via a
monthly monitoring system.  When negative deviations exist
between actual and target numbers,  we perform a detailed
analysis to identify and address the cause.  In addition,  we
benchmark the Group and brand results with those of our major
competitors on a quarterly basis.  We measure the Group's
future top-line development on the basis of our order backlog
development.  Order backlogs comprise orders received within
 period of up to nine months in advance of the actual sale.  Our
order book represents approximately 70 % of future anticipated
revenues.  Also increasingly important are other indicators
such as our own-retail activities and at-once business,  which
are not represented in the order book.  We provide updates on
these developments as part of our quarterly reports.  see Outlookp.  118

Sector Development,  p.  078

By segment,  development at adidas and TaylorMade-adidas Golf
exceeded our initial sales expectations while the Reebok segment performed marginally below initial expectations.  At
Reebok,  strong sales increases in the emerging marketsparticularly in Asia and in Eastern Europe,  could not fully
compensate lower than anticipated revenues in North America
and the UK.  The deliberate limitation of sales to mall-based
customers in North America contributed to this development. 
Management took this decision to reduce product discounting
at retail and protect brand image. 
For 2008 and 2009,  we have again committed to ambitious
targets which will help us optimize our Group's free cash flow
development going forward.  Despite lower expected global
economic growth in 2008,  we believe the current trading
environment will not negatively impact these expectations
given the high percentage of growth we expect to come from
emerging markets and the positive impetus of the major sporting events during the year.  We believe our targets are realistic
within the scope of the current trading environment,  and no
material event between the end of 2007 and the publication of
this report has altered our view.  see Subsequent Events,  p.  117

GLOBAL OPERATIONS The adidas Group's
Global Operations function coordinates the
development,  commercialization,  manufacturing and distribution of the majority of our
products and leads the Group's efforts in
supply chain improvement.  Our products are
almost entirely manufactured by independent
suppliers,  primarily located in Asia.  Global
Operations continually strives to increase
cost efficiency throughout our supply chainto ensure consistently high product quality
and to further improve our delivery performance.  With the integration of Reebok,  we
have already generated significant cost
savings by leveraging our increased buying
power,  consolidating logistics and warehousing and sharing best practices across
our supply chain. 

VAST MAJORITY OF PRODUCTION OUTSOURCED To minimize
production costs,  we outsource over 95 % of production to
independent third-party manufacturers,  primarily located in
Asia.  These suppliers possess excellent expertise in costefficient mass production of footwear,  apparel and accessories. 
We provide them with detailed specifications for production
and delivery.  However,  our Group also operates own production
and assembly sites in Germany (1),  Sweden (1),  Finland (1)the USA (4),  Canada (5),  China (1) and Japan (1).  In order to

OVER 350 INDEPENDENT MANUFACTURING PARTNERS In
2007,  Global Operations worked with 377 independent manufacturing partners.  This represents a 31 % decline from the
2006 number of 547 due to a planned consolidation in the
supply base and Reebok's apparel build-up program.  This
number excludes local sourcing partners of Group subsidiaries,  sourcing agents,  subcontractors,  second tier suppliers
and factories of our licensees.  Of our independent manufacturing partners,  71 % were located in Asia,  17 % were
located in Europe and 12 % in the Americas.  28 % of all
suppliers were located in China. 
Our Global Operations function manages product development,  commercialization and distribution and also supervises
sourcing of the adidas,  Reebok and adidas Golf brands.  Due
to different sourcing requirements in their respective fields of
business,  Rockport,  Reebok-CCM Hockey,  the Sports Licensed
Division and TaylorMade are not serviced through Global
Operations but instead utilize own purchasing organizations. 
In order to quickly seize short-term opportunities in their local
market or react to trade regulations,  Group subsidiaries may
also source from local suppliers outside the realm of Global
Operations.  Local purchases,  however,  account only for a
minor portion of the Group's total sourcing volume.

ASIA DOMINATES FOOTWEAR PRODUCTION 96 % of our total
2007 footwear volume for adidas,  Reebok and adidas Golf was
produced in this region (2006: 97 %).  Production in Europe and
the Americas combined accounted for 4 % of the sourcing
volume (2006: 3 %).  China represents our largest source
country with approximately 49 % of the total volume,  followed
by Vietnam with 28 % and Indonesia with 16 %.  The only significant change versus the prior year was a 3 percentage point
decline in Indonesia due to the closure of three factories in the
fourth quarter of 2006,  which had manufactured Reebok footwear.  In 2007,  our footwear suppliers produced approximately
201 million pairs of shoes (2006: approx.  200 million pairs). 
The year-over-year increase was solely attributable to a higher
sourcing volume at adidas while footwear purchases at Reebok
declined.  Our largest footwear factory produced approximately
11 % of the footwear sourcing volume (2006: 11 %).

PORTION OF ASIAN-PRODUCED APPAREL GROWS STRONGLY
In 2007,  we sourced 82 % of the total apparel volume for
adidas,  Reebok and adidas Golf from Asia (2006: 76 %).  The
higher proportion of Asian-sourced apparel was attributable
to continued sales growth in Asia,  which in turn required
higher sourcing volumes from the region.  Europe remained
the second largest apparel sourcing region,  representing
13 % of the volume (2006: 16 %).  The Americas accounted for
 % of the volume (2006: 8 %).  China was the largest source
country,  representing 32 % of the produced volume,  followed
by Thailand with 13 % and Indonesia with 11 %.  In total,  our
suppliers produced approximately 252 million units of apparel
in 2007 (2006: approx.  225 million units).  The largest apparel
factory produced approximately 12 % of this apparel volume
in 2007 (2006: 8 %).  In addition,  Reebok-CCM Hockey sourced
around 2 million units of apparel (primarily hockey jerseys) in
2007.  The vast majority of this volume was also produced in
Asia,  while small portions were sourced from the Americas
(particularly Canada) and Europe. 

The Sports Licensed Division sourced approximately 21 million
units of apparel and 18 million units of headwear (2006:
24 million and 18 million,  respectively).  The majority of purchased apparel products were sourced as unfinished goods
from Central America (67 %) and Asia (21 %),  and were subsequently finished in our own screenprinting facilities in the
USA.  On the other hand,  the majority of headwear sourced was
finished products manufactured predominately in Asia (79 %)
and the USA (20 %).

LION'S SHARE OF HARDWARE PRODUCED IN ASIA In 2007the bulk (i.  e.  96 %) of adidas and Reebok branded hardware
products,  such as balls and bags,  was also produced in Asia
(2006: 97 %).  China remained our largest source countryaccounting for 65 % of the sourced volume,  followed by
Vietnam with 17 % and Pakistan with 13 %.  The remaining 5 %
was sourced via other Asian and European countries.  The
total 2007 hardware sourcing volume was approximately
39 million units (2006: approximately 37 million units) with
the largest factory accounting for 28 % of production. 
TaylorMade and Reebok-CCM Hockey sourced 92 % and 98 %
of their hardware volumes from Asia,  respectively.  In additionboth brands sourced a small portion of hardware products in
the Americas.  At TaylorMade,  the majority of golf club components were manufactured by suppliers in China and assembled
by TaylorMade in the USA,  China and Japan. 
BEING CLOSEST TO EVERY CONSUMER All efforts of our
Global Operations team revolve around the vision to be closest
to every consumer.  This means meeting consumer demand in
various distribution channels with the right product (in terms
of quality,  size,  color,  style and material) in the right store at
the right time.  In addition,  it means quickly replenishing fastselling products at retail by sharing real-time customer sellthrough data with our suppliers.  Being closest to every consumer enables the Group to achieve:


Higher sales by consistently providing those products
at retail where consumer demand is high. 
Higher gross and operating margins as well as lower Group
inventory levels due to lower product markdowns and faster
sell-throughs.

FOCUS ON FIVE INITIATIVES Global Operations is focusing on
five key initiatives to optimize processes in our supply chain:


Replenishment: Providing high availability of product to our
customers while minimizing our inventory of finished goods. 

End-to-End Profitability: Identifying our key cost and profitability drivers and their interrelationships to optimize decisionmaking. 


Adaptive Supply Network: Enhancing the flexibility of both
our sourcing and logistics functions to address quick-changing
market needs. 


End-to-End Planning: Fundamentally challenging and optimizing our Group-wide demand and supply planning processes
to create more efficient,  transparent and cross-functionally
interlinked processes. 


Accelerated Creation-to-Shelf: Building capabilities and
technology that drive faster and more efficient product creation
to enhance the Group's top- and bottom-line growth. 
ADVANCEMENTS WITH ALL INITIATIVES In 2007,  we made
first steps in all five areas.  We started utilizing real-time sellthrough data on a Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) level to determine
replenishment needs at adidas own-retail stores in Europe. 
This helped us identify additional sales potential and reduce
overall markdowns.  As part of our End-to-End Profitability
initiative,  we developed a profitability simulation model that
incorporates product creation and delivery costs (i.  e.  total cost
perspective) to support decision-making in sourcing and
transportation.  With respect to the Adaptive Supply Network
initiative,  we made significant progress in warehousing and
launched several IT projects to improve speed and flexibility in
our supply chain.  During the year,  we also started our End-toEnd Planning initiative with new demand and supply planning
concepts. 

Within the scope of the Accelerated Creation-to-Shelf initiativewe implemented 6- and 13-month concept-to-shelf processes
(i.  e.  all activities from the first product sketch to the final
delivery to retailers) to support newly introduced business
models at brand adidas.  30 % of the fall / winter 2008 product
range was placed on those quicker timelines.  In addition,  for
the first time we used virtual product prototypes to accelerate
our product review process and reducing sampling costs. 
SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF 'WORLD CLASS BUYER" PROGRAM In 2007,  we were able to realize significant benefits as
 result of our 'World Class Buyer" program.  The objective
of this program was to maximize purchasing leverage across
the adidas and Reebok brands.  During the year,  we finalized
the implementation of a standardized costing framework for
both brands in footwear and made significant progress with
the roll-out of a similar framework in apparel.  As a resultwe generated cost synergies at both brands.  see Income
Statement,  p.  080

FURTHER INTEGRATION BENEFITS IN LOGISTICS In 2007we achieved significant synergies in freight and transportation
costs as a result of the harmonization of our global service
provider network.  We also made major headway in warehouse
integration.  In the UK,  construction of our new central distribution center for the adidas and Reebok brands in Manchester
was completed in December.  Operations are planned to commence in the first half of 2008,  so we expect to see the first
cost savings materialize in 2008.  Also,  construction work for
our two new central US distribution centers in SpartanburgSouth Carolina,  began in 2007.  We expect to start operating our
US apparel distribution center in the fourth quarter of 2008
and our US footwear warehouse a year later.  These two new
facilities will replace five existing adidas and Reebok warehouses. 

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR GROUP - Corporate Functions  Global Operations  Sustainability 
FIRST SUCCESS IN REEBOK APPAREL BUILD-UP In 2007,  we
stepped up our efforts to establish an in-house apparel organization for the Reebok brand.  On the sourcing side,  we phased
out Reebok's former sourcing agents.  This means that we will
source Reebok apparel solely through our own supply base
utilizing the established network of the adidas brand.  Reebok
also developed its first full apparel collection (spring / summer
2008) in the new organizational set-up following adidas best
practice processes.  In the coming years,  we will focus on
further improving Reebok's apparel processes to achieve
performance levels in line with the adidas brand. 
PROGRESSIVE RAMP-UP OF 'WORLD CLASS SUPPLY CHAIN"
AT BRAND ADIDAS In 2005,  we started our 'World Class
Supply Chain" initiative to optimize adidas' product offering,  to
best attack market opportunities and to improve profitability. 
In 2007,  we further extended its global footprint by implementing the brand model to all markets globally.  The brand
model delivers adidas brand concepts (e.  g.  adiSTAR,  TECHFIT™Predator®) to all markets globally with first priority in our
supply chain,  communications support and retail execution. 
The evergreen model provides short lead time and never-outof-stock capabilities for our most commercial long-lifecycle
products (e.  g.  basic apparel lines) through continuous replenishment. 
In 2007,  we also launched the quick response and global /
regional models.  The quick response model allows us to seize
additional market opportunities with six-month concept-toshelf processes.  We also put in place a customization business
model for 'mi adidas",  which is being extended to customized
football team wear.  Under our global / regional model,  we have
established four product creation centers around the globe to
ensure that we have the right mix between global consistency
and regional specifics to best address consumer needs in the
respective markets.  Together,  these four business models give
the adidas brand a competitive advantage to service a diverse
set of market needs in a more relevant and specific way. 

ANNUAL REPORT 2007 -- adidas Group 
SUSTAINABILITY The adidas Group must
manage wide-ranging commercial and competitive pressures to deliver growth.  Simultaneously,  we have a responsibility towards
our employees and the environment,  to ensure
that decent working conditions and environmental standards are met throughout our
global organization and supply chain.  We
always strive to manage both our own activities and our supply chain responsibly and to
reduce our environmental impact.  Moreoverwe believe that acting as good corporate
citizens will improve our corporate reputation
and hence our economic value,  helping us to
be a sustainable company. 

ACTIVE ENGAGEMENT WITH STAKEHOLDERS At the adidas
Group,  we pursue a policy of open dialog with our numerous
stakeholders.  We actively and systematically engage with
them,  involving them in key social and environmental decisions
that shape our day-to-day operations.  Through our membership in organizations such as the World Business Council
for Sustainable Development (WBCSD),  the World Federation
of the Sporting Goods Industry (WFSGI),  the Fair Factories
Clearinghouse (FFC) and the Fair Labor Association (FLA),  we
work closely with top companies from a variety of sectors to
develop sustainable business approaches and to debate social
and environmental topics on a global level.  In addition,  we
always strive to report in an open and transparent way.  Comprehensive information on the Group's social and environmental programs is provided in our 2007 Social and Environmental Report and on our website.  www, adidas-Group, com/

WORKPLACE STANDARDS SET RULES IN SUPPLY CHAIN
Following the acquisition of Reebok,  we combined the best of
both companies' previous social and environmental programs
and created a new Group-wide set of Workplace Standards
for our supply chain.  These are based on International Labour
Organization (ILO) and UN conventions relating to human
rights and employment practices,  and they follow the WFSGI
model code of conduct.  Our Workplace Standards contain clear
rules of conduct regarding:


These Standards help us select manufacturing partners and
serve as guiding principles in the early identification and treatment of potential issues of concern at our suppliers' sites. 
To illustrate how suppliers should implement our Standardswe have created a set of guidelines for use in factory settingswhich we update on a regular basis.  Currently,  we have
six guidelines (complemented by specific supplementary
materials) covering the following areas:


065

Health,  Safety and Environment (HSE)
Employment Standards
Best Environmental Practice
Worker Cooperatives
Enforcement of Workplace Standards
Sustainable Compliance 
The guidelines are also used by our Social and Environmental
Affairs (SEA) team to determine suppliers' compliance with our
Standards and to advise and train our suppliers in improving
their social and environmental performance.

WARNING-LETTER SYSTEM TO ENFORCE STANDARDS In the
event of a violation of the adidas Group's Workplace Standardswe immediately undertake all necessary steps to remedy the
situation.  Our internal monitors work closely with factory
management to develop concrete action plans with remediation
deadlines. 
When we find ongoing and serious instances of non-compliance
and a lack of commitment from factory management to address
the issues,  we issue a first formal warning letter including a
notification to factory management that their business relationship with the adidas Group is in jeopardy.  A second warning
letter is issued when adequate improvements have not been
made within agreed timelines.  After the second warning,  if the
supplier has still failed to initiate appropriate action to remedy
the situation,  a third and final warning letter will be sent.  On
any given issue,  failure to respond appropriately to the third
warning letter usually results in a termination of the business
relationship. 
In the event of continuous non-compliance,  we see termination
of the business relationship as a last resort.  Whenever possible,  however,  we prefer to stay in partnership and to work
from the inside to help encourage factory improvements. 
In 2007,  we terminated our business relationship with four
suppliers for compliance reasons. 
CAREFUL SUPPLIER SELECTION To improve working conditions throughout our supply chain,  our Group SEA team
works closely with the Global Operations function on supplier
selection.  The SEA team assesses all potential new suppliers
and orders can only be placed with a new supplier when
SEA approval has been granted. 

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR GROUP - Corporate Functions  Sustainability 
ENCOURAGING SELF-GOVERNANCE THROUGH MANAGEMENT SYSTEM SUPPORT Good management systems help
factories improve their day-to-day operations and support
the process of internalization and self-governance.  Thereforewe support our business partners in establishing management
systems with internationally recognized standards such as
ISO (International Standardization Organization) 14001
for quality and environmental management and OHSAS
(Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series) 18001. 
By running a certified management system,  our suppliers
demonstrate their commitment to continuously enhancing
their performance.  We help them build or improve human
resources systems to maintain proper working conditionsincluding factory grievance systems to routinely find and fix
non-compliance problems.  Further,  by enforcing employment
standards at our suppliers' sites,  we empower workers to
protect their own rights and take an active role in decisionmaking.  In 2007,  our Group's supply base included 22 athletic
footwear suppliers' factories worldwide,  which were OHSAS
18000 and / or ISO 14001 certified.  These suppliers produced
around 75 % of our footwear sourcing volume. 
TAILORED TRAINING TO ACHIEVE SUSTAINABLE
COMPLIANCE To achieve long-term sustainable compliancewe consider training even more important than monitoring
and policing factories.  Our SEA team offers specific training
courses for supervisors and managers to help them apply our
Standards.  Further,  we promote the establishment of sustainable structures that actively involve workers and management
of our suppliers as well as local employee associations and
non-governmental organizations (NGOs).  In this way,  acceptable working conditions become a routine part of business
activities.  In 2007,  the SEA team conducted 267 training
sessions and workshops for suppliers,  licensees,  workers
and adidas Group employees (2006: 173). 

INTERNAL MONITORING THROUGH FACTORY INSPECTIONS
The SEA team assesses compliance with the Workplace
Standards by means of factory inspections.  We apply innovative
monitoring approaches such as deeper and more frequent
monitoring than in previous years of fewer suppliers in our
core supply chain than in the past.  This allows us to rigorously
assess compliance risks and to identify the root causes of
non-compliance.  Our auditors check performance against a
customized risk list for each factory that is monitored.  The
methodology is linked to a factory rating which measures the
effectiveness of compliance systems and the work of their
administrators.  This enables us to precisely determine training
needs at our suppliers' factories.  The SEA team also acts as a
change agent,  advising our manufacturing partners how to
correct instances of non-compliance and how to prevent future
non-compliance.  During 2007,  we conducted 1007 factory
visits involving management and worker interviews,  document
review,  facility inspections and trainings at different levels in
our supply chain (2006: 1101 visits). 
EXTERNAL INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT UNDERLINES
CREDIBILITY OF SEA PROGRAM In addition to internal monitoring,  we value independent assessment by third parties to
demonstrate the credibility of and provide verified information
about our program to stakeholders.  In 1999,  we joined the FLAa non-profit multi-stakeholder coalition of private corporations,  NGOs and universities.  As a member,  the adidas Group
is subject to external assessment by independent monitorsparticipation in the FLA third-party complaint system and
public reporting.  The FLA publishes an annual report that
includes a transparent evaluation system for the results of
participating companies.  Following extensive reviews,  the FLA
accredited the individual monitoring programs of both adidas
(in 2005) and Reebok (in 2004).  In 2007,  the adidas Group as
 combined entity assumed the role as the FLA participating
company.  The next FLA evaluation and program re-accreditation
of the entire adidas Group monitoring program is scheduled for
2008.  Since joining the FLA,  more than 200 Independent
External Monitoring (IEM) audits and verification visits have
been conducted at adidas Group suppliers.  In 2007,  external
FLA-accredited independent monitors conducted 12 monitoring
audits (2006: 35) and 3 independent external verification visits
(2006: 8).

SYSTEM-BASED APPROACH TO MANAGE ENVIRONMENTAL
IMPACTS We have adopted a system-based approach to
managing environmental impacts in our own production facilities and throughout our supply chain.  Activities focus on
helping suppliers establish sound environmental management
systems to best reduce their negative environmental impacts. 
We develop guidelines and training programs for our suppliers
using the environmental performance of our own production
sites as examples of best practice.  We have mandated the
implementation of environmental management systems at our
core suppliers to ensure continuous monitoring and improvements.  In our product creation process,  we focus on improving
materials in our products and on tackling pollution in factories. 
Our goal is to eliminate polluting materials and processes and
to increasingly utilize sustainable materials instead.  To achieve
this goal we have several key initiatives in place such as controlling and monitoring restricted substances and reducing
emissions of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs).

1) At year-end. 

CONTROL AND MONITORING OF RESTRICTED SUBSTANCES
Restricted substances are those that cause harm or are suspected to cause harm to human health or the environment. 
Our suppliers are required to avoid using restricted substances.  We have specified clear standards that follow the
strictest local regulations and best practice standards for
consumer care and safety in the Group's policy for monitoring
and control of hazardous substances.  This policy is mandatory
for all business partners and is updated regularly based on
findings in our ongoing dialog with scientific organizations. 
Our standards cover the general requirements for eco-labels
and green seals (e.  g.  ÖKO-Tex Standard 100,  Tox Proof TUV
Rhineland,  etc. ) for footwear,  apparel and hardware products. 
Both our own quality assurance laboratories and external
testing institutes are used to constantly monitor material
samples to ensure supplier compliance with these requirements.  Materials that do not meet our standards and specifications are rejected. 

REDUCING VOC EMISSIONS Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)which are typically found in solvents used in our manufacturing
process,  can cause breathing difficulties and other health
problems for production workers.  Therefore,  we are committed
to reducing VOC emissions in our suppliers' footwear factories. 
Our efforts focus on nearly all new adidas Group footwear
factories and reflect the technical synergies of sharing information,  data and sources on production questions such as
water-based cement systems.  At our core footwear suppliers
we measure the exposure and the records taken provide
evidence that workers are not being exposed to dangerous
levels of VOCs.  Nonetheless,  we remain committed to further
reducing emissions.  In recent years,  we have made significant
progress.  Our athletic footwear suppliers in Asia and Europe
have reduced VOC emissions from 140 grams per pair in 2000
to 203 grams per pair in 2007.  Our target is an average VOC
emission of 20 grams / pair of shoes. 
STRONG SUSTAINABILITY TRACK RECORD REFLECTED IN
INDEX MEMBERSHIPS We appreciate positive recognition
from international institutions and rating agencies,  NGOs and
socially responsible investment analysts.  They evaluate our
efforts through in-depth analysis of our social and environmental program,  including document review as well as interviews with employees and management.  As a result,  adidas AG
has been included in a variety of high-profile sustainability
indexes.  see Our Share,  p.  036

EMPLOYEES At the adidas Group,  we know
that our people are crucial to our success. 
Becoming the global leader in the sporting
goods industry depends on the performancepotential,  enthusiasm and dedication of our
employees.  We promote a performance
culture and therefore link employee compensation to Group and individual achievements. 
We aim to develop our employees with
opportunities for career progression,  while
striving to promote a culture that celebrates

EXPANSION OF GLOBAL EMPLOYEE BASE CONTINUES On
December 31,  2007,  the Group had 31344 employees,  which
represents an increase of 19 % versus the previous year's
level of 26376.  This development is primarily related to new
employees in the adidas segment in emerging markets as
well as own-retail activities.  Personnel expenses increased
18 % to € 1279 billion in 2007 from € 1087 billion in 2006see Note 25,  p.  184 representing 30 % of the Group's total operating expenses (2006: 29 %) and 12 % of Group sales (2006: 11 %).

ADIDAS SEGMENT DRIVES EMPLOYEE GROWTH The development of our employee numbers varied significantly from a
brand perspective.  The number of employees at the adidas
brand increased 25 % to 18678 at the end of 2007 (2006:
14906),  mainly driven by the brand's strong expansion,  especially in own retail and in the emerging markets of Eastern
Europe (e.  g.  Russia),  Asia and Latin America.  Staff at Reebok
declined 11 %,  attributable to a shift in the workforce to the
Group functions and adidas brand as well as the elimination of
duplicative positions.  Hence,  the Reebok segment comprised
6751 employees at year-end (2006: 7545).  At TaylorMadeadidas Golf,  the number of employees increased by 2 % to
1393 (2006: 1368).  The number of employees working in our
Group functions increased sharply by 77 % to 4522 (2006:
2552).  The main reason for this development was the expansion of the Sports Licensed Division to a cross-brand corporate
license department,  including licensed products from brand
adidas (e.  g.  NBA jerseys) and Reebok (e.  g.  NHL and NFL
jerseys).  Excluding this effect,  employment within our Group
functions increased 23 %. 
GLOBAL MOBILITY ACTIVELY PROMOTED Our employees work
at more than 150 locations around the world.  We actively
encourage global mobility and offer our employees the opportunity to go on international assignments.  At the end of 200747 % of our staff was employed in Europe (2006: 42 %),  31 % in
North America (2006: 35 %),  18 % in Asia (2006: 19 %) and 4 % in
Latin America (2006: 4 %).  To support relocating professionals
and their families in new living and working environments,  we
provide,  for example,  relevant language and cultural training.

DIVERSITY A KEY SUCCESS FACTOR Diversity is one of our
Group's strengths and core values.  see Inside Cover We believe
that the diversity of our workforce helps us to sustain a competitive advantage.  Therefore,  we are committed to understanding,  valuing and incorporating the growing diversity of
our global marketplace into the corporate culture of the adidas
Group.  As part of our training and development program,  for
example,  we offer specific modules on diversity management. 
This helps us to ensure organizational success and stability. 
The high degree of diversity is also reflected in our workforce
that comprises men and women of various nationalitiescultures,  religions and races,  who encompass a wide range
of experience,  skills and mentalities.  At our corporate headquarters,  for example,  we have employees from around
50 countries. 
THREE-PILLAR HUMAN RESOURCES STRATEGY Our Human
Resources activities focus on the implementation and execution of our Group's Human Resources strategy,  which is based
on three pillars:


Creating a working environment that stimulates team spiritpassion,  engagement and achievement
Expanding our performance culture based upon strong
leadership
Being an 'Employer of Choice"

LEARNING ORGANIZATION ENGAGES EMPLOYEES A key
concept that drives our Human Resources management is
employee engagement.  To be a successful company,  employee
engagement is paramount as we believe that only engaged
employees are satisfied and committed.  We regularly conduct
engagement surveys,  to offer our employees the opportunity to
give feedback to Group and brand management.  Via our global
intranet,  we offer our employees the opportunity to exchange
ideas directly with senior management and raise questions
(through our 'Ask the Management" application).  Furthermorewe regularly hold all-employee meetings at our locations
around the world,  where our staff have the opportunity to
openly share their views with senior management.  In this
sense,  employee engagement helps us broaden the knowledge
base across our organization and supports our pursuit of continuous improvement in a timely and cost-efficient way.  In 2008we plan to implement a new online platform for employees to
raise suggestions on how to improve internal processes and
contribute their ideas for innovative technologies,  designs or
product concepts.  To further promote employee participationwe will run competitions for the top ideas that are implementedincluding awards for those employees who come up with the
most beneficial suggestions. 

As a result,  Human Resources closely interacts with our operational teams on a Group,  brand,  regional and divisional level. 
In 2007,  focus areas included the harmonization of policies and
standards across the Group and the further integration of
Reebok.  Human Resources held,  for example,  two 'collaboration workshops" in Asia and designed specific cross-brand
leadership programs to promote respect and support between
employees of our different brands.  We also established a new
Group-wide competency model that defines the required
competencies for executive,  management and professional
employees.

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR GROUP - Corporate Functions  Employees 
CONSTANTLY INCREASING ATTRACTIVENESS To become
and remain an 'Employer of Choice",  we strive to consistently
enhance our employer branding.  Our attractiveness as an
employer is clearly shown by several external rankings.  We
ranked fifth of the 100 most attractive employers for business
students according to 'The European Student Barometer 2007"
– the largest survey conducted among university students
across 18 European countries.  In China,  we were included
among the top employers in the Shanghai region in 2007 by
CRF (Corporate Research Foundation),  which is just one
example of our particular attractiveness in emerging markets. 
CENTRALIZED RECRUITING APPROACH IMPROVES HIRING
PROCESS To benefit from our excellent reputation,  we not only
need to attract but also to recruit high potentials.  In 2006,  we
established a new strategic recruiting and employer branding
competence center for the Group in order to have access to the
best suitable talent on a global scale.  In 2007,  we extended
this focus by assembling an executive recruitment team that
focusses on identifying and building relationships with executive level candidates.  Further,  we rolled out a global e-recruiting system that covers more than 20 countries and features job
information in the respective local languages.  Our centralized
approach and the new e-recruiting system are helping us to
better take advantage of global candidate pools and increase
the efficiency,  effectiveness and speed of our recruitment
process.  Over the next two years,  we will extend and optimize
our e-recruiting system and launch a new employer branding
campaign. 

NURTURING EMERGING EMPLOYEES We strive to provide our
emerging employees (i.  e.  apprentices,  interns and trainees)
with the best possible environment when joining our workforce.  To achieve this goal,  we have established clearly defined
and targeted programs. 


Our apprenticeship programs offer young people who want
to join our Group straight out of high school the opportunity to
gain relevant business experience in a three-year rotation
program.  These programs include vocational training in retailindustrial management and IT as well as integrated study programs.  At the end of 2007,  we employed 45 apprentices in
Germany (2006: 46). 


Our global internship program provides students with challenging and interesting four to six months' work experience
within the adidas Group.  For 'best-of-class" interns,  we initiated a 'Re-Bound" Program to remain in close contact with
them after they have finished their original internship and
foster potential future employment.  At the end of 2007,  we
employed 189 interns in Germany (2006: 142). 


Our 12- to 18-month functional trainee program (FTP) gives
graduates with international backgrounds and excellent educational credentials the opportunity to start their career with the
adidas Group.  The program comprises six three-month assignments in varying departments.  At least one of these assignments takes place abroad.  On top of this functional programwe have implemented an international cross-functional and
cross-brand business management program (BMP).  With this
concept we want to attract professionals with MBA degrees
and three to five years' work experience to prepare them for
future management positions within our Group.  At year-end
2007,  we employed 23 participants (2006: 22) in our FTP and 7
(2006: 3) in the BMP. 

ANNUAL REPORT 2007 -- adidas Group 
EMPLOYEE DEVELOPMENT BASED ON THREE SUCCESS
DRIVERS Just like athletes,  our Group's employees need a
training plan to build on their strengths,  improve their technique and overcome their own challenges on the way to reach
their goals.  Our Group's employee development program
incorporates behavioral,  managerial,  technical and language
training for different target groups.  We base our training
efforts on three success drivers:


Leadership Excellence: All members of senior and middle
management are encouraged to instill a performance culture
in our teams by acting as role models. 


Performance Management: Through our global PEP
(Performance Evaluation and Planning) tool we not only
measure our employees' job performance but also set individual business targets and plan training and development
activities.  We offer targeted support (e.  g.  basic skill training
in team development or business coaching) for both individual and team performance improvement. 


Talent Management: With specifically designed talent
management tools and processes,  we identify employees at
all levels who have the potential to become leaders in our
organization.  In order to prepare them for new and more complex future roles,  they participate in targeted development
programs for various levels within the organization. 
In 2007,  we intensified our activities in performance and talent
management.  We enhanced our Group-wide PEP systemto focus more on performance evaluation and career development.  Further,  we introduced a new Advanced Management
Training program for employees at a department head position
or higher.  The program's goal is to enable them to continually
improve their skills in change management,  strategic thinkingteam leadership and coaching. 

PERFORMANCE AT THE CORE OF REMUNERATION SYSTEM
We are committed to rewarding our employees with effective
compensation and benefit programs that are competitive in the
marketplace.  Remuneration throughout the Group comprises
fixed and variable monetary compensation,  non-monetary
rewards,  as well as other intangible benefits.  The cornerstone of our rewards program is our Global Salary Management System (GSMS).  It is used as a basis to set the value of
employees' positions and salaries in a clear,  market-driven
and performance-oriented way.  GSMS provides the global
framework for managing base compensation in the adidas
Group and for making performance-related base salary adjustments.  In addition to a fixed base salary,  we also offer our
employees various variable compensation components:

Other benefits include our 401-K pension plans in the USA
and the adidas pension plan for our employees in Germany. 
In 2007,  1396 employees participated in the latter,  which
represents an increase of 21 % compared to the previous year. 
Other Group subsidiaries also grant a variety of additional
benefits to employees depending on locally defined practices
and country-specific norms such as discount allowances that
provide our employees with the possibility to purchase discounted products in our own stores.  In 2007,  we further refined
and optimized our Group's rewards programs.  We completed
the implementation of the Group's compensation system
at Reebok and we continued to realize cost synergies (e.  g. 
harmonization of the payroll system),  particularly in the USA. 

071


Bonus Program: Within the adidas Group,  certain employees
are eligible for a bonus based on their respective job grade
level as specified in GSMS.  Our Group's bonus program combines individual (measured in the PEP process) and corporate
performance (actual financial results measured against Groupbrand,  division and / or business unit targets). 


Profit Sharing: For employees who are not eligible for the
bonus program,  profit sharing is used as an incentive to reward
the achievement of the Group's profit target.  In 2007,  for
example,  we again paid a one-time gratification to employees
in Germany. 

02


Additional compensation components for senior management and Executive Board members include Long-Term
Incentive Programs (LTIP) and a Management Share Option
Plan (MSOP).  see Compensation Report,  p.  030

ANNUAL REPORT 2007 -- adidas Group

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Being a
performance leader in our industry,  product
innovation leadership is critical to the ongoing
success of our Group.  As a result,  research
and development (R & D) is a cornerstone
for our business going forward.  We invest
considerable resources into continuously
developing and commercializing technological
innovations and fresh design ideas,  in order
to best unite our brands' values with the
unique needs of our consumers.  The research
and development process is driven by internal teams of designers,  product developers as
well as in-house experts from the fields of
biomechanics,  materials technology,  product
and process engineering,  design and similar
disciplines. 

AMBITIOUS R & D TARGETS Research and development is crucial for our Group's success as we continuously strive to meet
and exceed the expectations of our consumers and customers
with respect to technology and design.  Numerous awards for
our innovative products are proof of our technology leadership
within our industry.  These awards are important for our Group
as they demonstrate our innovation leadership in footwear and
apparel to consumers.  Our Group's commitment to bringing at
least one new revolutionary technology or ground-breaking
evolution to the market each year highlights that research and
development remains a cornerstone for our Group going forward.  see Group Strategy,  p.  044
EFFICIENT R & D STRUCTURE Research and development
within the adidas Group is organized in a decentralized structure,  i.  e.  each brand separately runs its own research,  design
and development activities,  with major locations in several
countries.  To maximize efficiency,  our brand teams collaborate closely,  sharing fundamental and biomechanical research
as well as existing technologies.  In 2007,  we incorporated
 last from a version of the adidas Predator® football boot into
Reebok's new Sprintfit product.  This transfer of basic football
know-how highlights the type of technology sharing we strive
to promote within the Group.  Another example of intra-Group
know-how transfer is the incorporation of adidas TORSION®
technology throughout a current collection of Rockport footwear.  Within our brands,  R & D teams generally have a dual
focus dedicated to different product categories and to new
technology platforms.  Cross-category technology sharingsuch as the transfer of the adidas ForMotion™ technology from
running to basketball at the adidas brand,  the KFS technology
from running to football or the Movable Weight Technology™
from metalwoods to irons at TaylorMade,  helps to further
optimize and commercialize our R & D efforts in an efficient
way.  The adidas Group also purchases a limited amount
of R & D expertise from well-established research partnersin particular fundamental research.

INDUSTRY-LEADING R & D AT TAYLORMADE-ADIDAS GOLF
TaylorMade-adidas Golf's R & D team is focused on continually
designing and developing industry-leading products.  Before
products are brought to market,  the R & D team conducts
extensive testing including frequent and thorough input from
Tour professionals such as Sergio Garcia,  Justin Rose or
Natalie Gulbis.  In addition to the segment's own R & D activities,  and utilizing ait's know-how in adidas Golf footwear and
apparel,  TaylorMade-adidas Golf works together with external
partners such as the Universities of Calgary,  Canada,  and
Portland,  USA.  TaylorMade purchases external hardware
expertise amounting to 7 % of the total R & D expenditure at
the brand.  In 2007,  this included a study of all stages of a golf
ball's trajectory,  from impact to finish,  and an ongoing analysis
of the golf swing using motion analysis technology (MATT). 
ACTIVE TRADEMARK AND PATENT PROTECTION POLICY
To capitalize on the Group's R & D achievements,  we seek to
gain trademark and patent protection for our key footwearapparel and hardware products,  technologies and innovations
in all major markets.  We hold registered trademark rights or
have applied for trademark protection for the Group's brands
and other proprietary names in most countries around the
world.  However,  because our Group holds numerous patents
we are not dependent upon any single patent or licensed
technology.  As part of our business policy,  we rigorously
defend the Group's trademarks and patents by monitoring
and prosecuting infringements of our trademark and patent
rights around the world.  In addition,  we rigorously defend
our brands' innovations against counterfeiting and imitation.

EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS REDUCE R & D EXPENSES
 & D costs at the adidas Group are recognized as expense in
the period in which they are incurred and are not capitalized
as a result of the short product lifecycles in the sporting goods
industry.  Efficiency improvements due to the collaboration
of the adidas and Reebok product development teams led to a
decrease of adidas Group R & D expenses by 14 % to € 84 million in 2007 (2006: € 98 million).  In 2007,  R & D expenses
represented 21 % of total operating expenses versus 26 %
in the prior year.  R & D expenses as a percentage of sales
decreased slightly to 08 % from 10 % in 2006.  see Note 24,  p. 184
Other related expenses for product development and market
research,  for example,  were incurred as part of the Group's
other operating overheads. 
HIGHLY SKILLED TECHNICAL PERSONNEL For all our brandsthe success of our R & D efforts depends on bringing together
 diverse and highly skilled workforce.  Personnel expenses
represent by far the largest portion of R & D expenses,  accounting for 65 % of total R & D expenditure.  At December 31,  2007976 people were employed in the Group's R & D activities
compared to 1040 employees in 2006 (– 6 %).  This represents
3% of total Group employees (2006: 4 %).  The decrease in
employees was mainly driven by the elimination of duplicative
 & D efforts as part of the Reebok integration into the adidas
Group.  The R & D departments for each brand comprise experienced teams from different areas of expertise including
mechanical engineering,  materials engineering,  industrial
design,  biomechanics,  finite element analysis,  advanced CAD
design and product development.  As a result,  our teams
include engineers as well as experts in product developmentdesign research and other areas.

360° R & D APPROACH AT ADIDAS R & D activities at brand
adidas focus on the development of innovative footwearapparel and hardware technologies.  To solidify adidas' position
as a leader in technology and innovation,  the adidas Innovation
Team (ait) is responsible for the ongoing development of new
technologies and concepts in all key product categories.  The
Team is divided into groups that focus on individual product
categories such as basketball,  football or cross-category project areas such as Intelligent Products or Energy Management
Systems (cushioning technologies). 
 & D projects follow a holistic 360° approach that involves
collaboration with various professional and amateur athletes
in different sports categories each year such as Zinédine
Zidane,  Michael Ballack,  Elena Isinbayeva,  Allyson Felix and
Jeremy Wariner.  In addition,  adidas works with clubs such
as A.  C.  Milan and Bayern Munich to test and optimize products
according to their needs and ideas.  This approach of creating
market-ready products clearly is a competitive advantage in
the sporting goods industry. 
In 2007,  adidas collaborated with well-established global
research partners such as the Sports Technology Research
Group of the Universities of Loughborough and SheffieldEngland,  and the University of Calgary,  Canada.  Projects
include,  for example,  long-term studies related to the characteristics of footballs,  motion analysis in running and basketball and intelligent product solutions.  In addition,  adidas
consults medical expert teams including doctors and physical
therapists to analyze and measure the health-related impact
of new innovations before commercialization.  However,  the
amount of purchases for external R & D expertise was not
 significant factor within the total adidas R & D expenses. 

REEBOK R & D FOCUSED ON FIT IN 2007 Within the Reebok
segment,  each division runs separate R & D teams due to their
heterogeneous product offerings. 

073


At brand Reebok,  the Reebok Advanced Concepts (RAC) and
Reebok Equipment teams create footwear,  apparel and equipment with the primary focus on developing product that provides 'a perfect fit" for the consumer based on functionaesthetics and value.  In 2007,  Reebok implemented 893 'fit"
initiatives into product for the spring / summer 2008 collection. 


The R & D team at Reebok-CCM Hockey is dedicated to
continuously creating state-of-the-art hockey equipment for
both professional and recreational players. 


Rockport's R & D function is a vertically integrated organization that covers all aspects of strategy,  research,  designengineering and testing,  while incorporating the Group's
advanced proprietary athletic footwear technologies into
casual and dress shoes. 

In all Reebok divisions,  R & D includes a development /
engineering team as well as a design and commercialization
team,  a human performance laboratory and a prototype sampling
group with the product marketing teams in each strategic
business unit.  Major projects involve extensive fit,  wear and
materials testing to qualify and assess the durability and functionality of Reebok products.  R & D expertise from well-known
external parties such as the Central Michigan University or the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is also used for
specific projects.  However,  the amount of purchases for external R & D expertise was not a significant factor within Reebok's
 & D expenses in 2007.

CONTINUOUS FLOW OF PRODUCT INNOVATION IN 2007
Developing industry-leading technologies is only one aspect
of being an innovation leader.  Even more important is the successful commercialization of those technological innovations. 
The majority of adidas Group sales in 2007 were generated
with products newly introduced in the course of the year and
our launch schedule for 2008 highlights a full pipeline of innovative products.  see Outlook,  p.  118
SUCCESSFUL PRODUCT LAUNCHES ACROSS ALL MAJOR
ADIDAS CATEGORIES Brand adidas' success in 2007 was
largely based on launching evolutions of existing technologies
in all major categories.  Products launched in 2007 accounted
for 77 % of brand sales and only 6 % of total sales were generated with products introduced three or more years ago. 
Examples of adidas running advancements included new versions of the core adiSTAR and Supernova families featuring
ForMotion™ technology as well as the next generations of
the Response and BOUNCE™ running shoes.  The importance
of these four product families is significant as over five million
products were sold from these four product families together. 
The positive development in the training category also benefited from the launch of adidas' most innovative functional line
of performance apparel to date,  adidas TECHFIT™. 
SIGNIFICANT PRODUCT INNOVATION AT REEBOK IN 2007
Increasing the number of product innovations Reebok develops
and commercializes each year is critical to our efforts to
improve Reebok's performance orientation.  At brand Reebok61 % of ordered footwear products were launched in 2007.  Only
10 % of ordered footwear products were related to products
introduced three or more years ago.  Running was a key focus
with the launch of several new products in 2007 such as the
Trinity KFS II,  PUMP Paris Trainer and HATANA running shoes. 
These were all part of Reebok's Premier Running Series
of premium running products where the brand sold around
one million pairs of footwear in 2007. 

At Reebok-CCM Hockey,  products launched in 2007 accounted
for 58 % of sales.  Only 12 % of sales were generated with
products introduced at least three years ago.  In apparelReebok-CCM Hockey launched the Rbk EDGE Uniform System™
in hockey,  which was designed in collaboration with NHL teams
and players.  This was the first new NHL league jersey in 20 yearsfeaturing technologically advanced materials and fabrics that
are more breathable,  more resistant to water absorption and
offer greater range of movement.  As a result,  all NHL teams
now wear this jersey,  and we sold over 700000 units of this
product in 2007.  Due to the different business model for the
Rockport brand with a larger focus on non-athletic styles,  the
impact from new styles is significantly lower.  As a result,  products launched in 2007 accounted for 50 % of sales.  Less than
20 % of total sales were generated with products introduced
more than three years ago. 
INNOVATION CONTINUES AS KEY SUCCESS FACTOR FOR
TAYLORMADE-ADIDAS GOLF In the TaylorMade-adidas Golf
segment,  current products (i.  e.  products launched in the last
18 months,  which is the typical product lifecycle in golf)
represented 75 % of total hardware sales.  Products that had
been brought to market three or more years ago accounted for
only 1 %.  Major innovations were the r7® SuperQuad drivers
and the Burner® family of metalwoods,  which now represent
around 45 % of TaylorMade's total metalwood offering.  adidas
Golf successfully launched a new performance shoe,  the
POWERBAND,  which incorporates three sophisticated adidas
Golf technologies,  and the TOUR360 II,  a new version of the
successful TOUR360.  These innovative products accounted for
around 40 % of adidas Golf footwear sales in 2007.  The Clima
concept was further extended to shorts and pants in adidas
Golf apparel as well as in several launches in the women's
category and is now included in around 90 % of adidas Golf
apparel products.

GROUP BUSINESS PERFORMANCE In 2007the adidas Group again delivered strong
financial performance.  Group sales and profitability developed in line with Management's
initial expectations.  Currency-neutral sales
increased 7 %.  Strong sales growth in the
adidas segment had the biggest impact on this
development.  In euro terms,  adidas Group
revenues grew 2 % to € 10299 billion in 2007
from € 10084 billion in 2006.  The Group's gross
margin increased 28 percentage points to
474 % of sales in 2007 (2006: 446 %) as a result
of improvements in all segments.  The Group's
gross profit increased 9 % to reach € 4882 billion in 2007 versus € 4495 billion in 2006.  The
Group's operating margin grew 05 percentage
points to 92 % from 87 % in 2006,  due to the
higher gross margin which more than offset
higher operating expenses as a percentage of
sales.  The Group's operating profit increased
 % to € 949 million in 2007 versus € 881 million in 2006.  The Group's net income attributable to shareholders grew 14 % to € 551 million
from € 483 million in 2006.  Diluted earnings
per share increased 14 % to € 257 in 2007
versus € 225 in 2006. 

ECONOMIC AND SECTOR DEVELOPMENT

REGIONAL GDP DEVELOPMENT 1)
in %

GLOBAL ECONOMIC EXPANSION SLOWS The global economy
expanded by 36 % in 2007.  This represents a modest slowdown
versus the prior year (2006: 38 %).  Following strong increases
in the first six months of the year,  turbulence on international
capital and credit markets resulting from the subprime crisis in
the USA dampened economic expansion as the year progressed. 

Global 
Europe 
USA

Asia 
010

008

In Europe,  full year GDP grew 29 % (2006: 31 %).  Growth was
primarily a result of the region's emerging markets whichwith around 6 % GDP expansion,  again outperformed Western
European economies.  The latter mainly showed lower GDP
growth compared to the prior year.  Following a peak in May
2007,  consumer confidence in the EU declined steadily over
the remainder of the year. 
In the USA,  economic growth slowed to a level of 22 % in 2007
(2006: 29 %).  This was largely a result of spillover effects
from the subprime crisis.  US consumer confidence declined
consistently from mid-summer to November 2007,  reaching
its lowest level since late 2005.  The main drivers of this decline
were rising oil prices,  less available credit as a result of the
subprime issue,  and a weak dollar.

1) Real,  percentage change versus prior year; 2007 figures are estimated. 

In Asia,  most of the region's economies continued on a strong
upswing.  Asia's GDP grew 86 % in 2007 (2006: 85 %).  GDP
growth in China was 115 %,  while Japan's economy expanded
by only 19 %.  The region's other emerging markets grew
at double-digit rates as a result of flourishing export activity. 
Consumer confidence in Asia increased,  with the exception
of Japan. 
Latin American economies continued to be positively influenced by the global surge in commodity prices and increased
export activity.  As a result,  GDP growth in the region was
50 % in 2007 (2006: 52 %).  Consumer confidence in the region
decreased slightly as a result of an increasing number of
consumers struggling with high credit costs.

MIXED DEVELOPMENT OF GLOBAL SPORTING GOODS INDUSTRY
In 2007,  the global sporting goods industry had a mixed regional
development.  The European sporting goods industry was
stable,  while the US market remained highly competitive.  Asia
and Latin America contributed significantly to our industry's
growth. 
EUROPEAN SPORTING GOODS INDUSTRY STABLE In Europerevenues in the largest sporting goods markets were basically
unchanged compared to the prior year.  Slightly weaker sales
in Western Europe were offset by stronger sales in the region's
emerging markets.  Lower sales in Western Europe primarily
resulted from the non-recurrence of positive effects related
to the 2006 FIFA World Cup™ and a continuously difficult retail
landscape in the UK.  Footwear sales remained stable in 2007
compared to the previous year.  Apparel sales,  howeverdecreased at a low-single-digit rate,  largely driven by the nonrecurrence of the 2006 FIFA World Cup™ jersey and replica
volumes. 
From a country perspective,  growth in Spain and France was
offset by promotional market conditions in other countries. 
The UK market in particular saw continued contraction,  with
volumes declining.  Nevertheless,  average prices started to
recover over the course of the year.  Average selling prices for
footwear and apparel in the other countries also stabilized. 
On a category basis,  the European market continues to be positively influenced by growth in the outdoor and lifestyle categories.  Running was negatively impacted by the ongoing trend
towards sport fusion styles,  and the football category declined
due to the non-recurrence of positive effects related to the
2006 FIFA World Cup™.  Channel development was mixed. 
General sporting goods stores were the major growth channel
on the footwear side,  while the volume channel was the only
growth channel on the apparel side. 
US SPORTING GOODS INDUSTRY HIGHLY COMPETITIVE
The sporting goods industry in North America continued to be
dominated by the shift towards new sport fusion styles.  These
styles gained strongly on the back of significant losses in the
classics and basketball categories. 

The footwear market grew at a mid-single-digit rate in 2007. 
Sales in the apparel market were largely unchanged versus
the prior year.  Average selling prices increased marginally across
the industry.  Sport fusion and vulcanized footwear styles increased markedly.  The region's retail environment continued
to be very challenging,  driven by price competition in the athletic specialty channel.  Retail growth was strongest in the
sporting goods and family footwear channels. 

079

ASIAN SPORTING GOODS MARKET FLOURISHES In Asia,  the
sporting goods sector grew at a high-single-digit rate in 2007. 
Stagnation in Japan was more than compensated by strong
growth in the region's emerging markets,  in particular China. 
In these markets,  footwear sales grew at a double-digit rate
with running,  basketball and training being the main contributors.  Apparel sales also increased at a double-digit ratemainly due to growth in the training category.  Average selling
prices were stable throughout the region. 
LATIN AMERICAN SPORTING GOODS MARKET INCREASES
In Latin America,  the sporting goods industry developed in
line with the overall economy and grew at a mid-single-digit
rate compared to the prior year.  Both apparel and footwear
sales increased modestly in 2007 compared to the previous
year,  reflecting higher consumer spending in the region. 
Average selling prices increased in Argentina and Venezuela
due to high inflation rates and were stable in the region's other
countries. 
ADIDAS GROUP OUTPACES INDUSTRY AND OVERALL
ECONOMIC GROWTH In 2007,  adidas Group revenues grew
faster than both the economy and the sporting goods industry
in all regions,  with the exception of North America.  From
 macroeconomic perspective,  the two most important
indicators of how conducive a region's economic development
is to our business are GDP growth and consumer confidence. 
Performance in the sporting goods industry,  however,  is
often more influenced by product category trends,  development of key retail partners as well as pricing and volume
trends in the sector. 

ANNUAL REPORT 2007 -- adidas Group

INCOME STATEMENT
NO CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICY The Group's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).  In line with
IFRS,  several new or amended standards and interpretations
were applied for the first time in 2007.  see Note 1,  p.  157 Nevertheless,  there were no changes in the Group's consolidation
and accounting principles.  Therefore,  changes in accounting
policy and changes in management discretion in the application
of accounting standards had no impact on Group business
performance in the reporting period. 
TWELVE MONTHS OF REEBOK RESULTS CONSOLIDATED
Several factors influenced the comparison of 2007 reported
results for the Group and our segments with the prior year. 
Only eleven months of Reebok's results were consolidated in
2006 due to the acquisition date (February 1,  2006).  In 2007twelve months of the segment's results were consolidated.  This
had a positive impact on the comparison of Reebok segment
sales to the prior year.  The segment's operating margin,  however,  was negatively affected,  as the month of January is
traditionally characterized by higher-than-average clearance
activities.  In addition,  Reebok's operating profit was negatively
impacted by purchase price allocation charges,  however
to a significantly lesser extent compared to the prior year. 
In 2007,  the negative effect on Reebok's operating profit amounted
to € 12 million (2006: € 89 million).  Sales and operating margin
at TaylorMade-adidas Golf were negatively affected by the
divestiture of the Greg Norman Collection (GNC) wholesale
business,  which was completed on November 21,  2006. 
SYNERGIES SUPPORT OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE The
operational performance of the adidas and Reebok segments
was positively impacted by the realization of revenue and cost
synergies resulting from the integration of the Reebok business
into the adidas Group. 

Revenue synergies mainly occurred in the Reebok segment. 
Sales increased incrementally in several countries for which
Reebok had purchased the distribution rights in order to better
control brand management and gain market share.  Revenues
grew particularly strongly in Russia and China,  where Reebok
took full control of distribution effective January 1,  2007.  Revenue synergies also had a small positive impact on sales development in the adidas segment.  This was a result of higher
revenues from the licensed business,  in particular from our
partnership with the NBA. 
Cost synergies resulting from the combination of adidas and
Reebok sourcing activities had a positive impact on the cost of
sales of both segments,  in particular for adidas due to the
higher volume of products sourced compared to Reebok.  Due
to the timing of sourcing improvements,  cost synergies were
weighted towards the second half of the year.  On a full year
basis,  the positive impact on the Group's gross margin was
largely offset by integration costs which negatively impacted
the Group's operating expenses.  These costs were recorded
in the HQ / Consolidation segment and to a lesser extent at
adidas and Reebok.  In line with our initial expectations,  we
realized revenue synergies of around € 100 million.  Net cost
synergies exceeded initial expectations and amounted to
around € 20 million in the full year 2007. 
ADIDAS GROUP CURRENCY-NEUTRAL SALES GROW 7 %
In 2007,  Group revenues increased 7 % on a currency-neutral
basis,  mainly as a result of sales growth in the adidas segment.  This development was in line with initial Management
expectations of mid-single-digit growth.  Currency movements
negatively impacted Group sales in euro terms.  Group revenues grew 2 % in euro terms to € 10299 billion in 2007 from
€ 10084 billion in 2006.  On a like-for-like basis,  including
Reebok's revenues for the full twelve-month periods of both
years and excluding the effect from the divestiture of the GNC
wholesale business,  Group sales also increased 7 %.

ADIDAS SEGMENT DRIVES TOP-LINE GROWTH The adidas
segment set the pace for the Group's organic sales growth in
2007.  Currency-neutral adidas segment revenues increased
12 % during the period.

Currency-neutral sales in the Reebok segment were stable as
 result of the consolidation of twelve months of Reebok's

On a like-for-like basis,  Reebok segment sales declined by 5 %
in 2007.  This like-for-like comparison of Reebok segment
revenues reflects sales for the full twelve-month periods of
both years.  It also includes GNC retail sales which were transferred from the TaylorMade-adidas Golf segment to the Reebok

segments.  In 2007,  the HQ / Consolidation segment primarily
comprised sales of Salomon products as part of our cooperation agreement with Amer Sports Corporation.  The agreement
was entered into to support the transfer of Salomon's business activities to Amer Sports Corporation.  Compared to the
prior year,  sales decreased by 60 % on a currency-neutral
basis.  This development was mainly due to the expiration of
the Salomon footwear sourcing cooperation agreement.

ANNUAL REPORT 2007 -- adidas Group

SALES INCREASE IN NEARLY ALL REGIONS adidas Group sales
grew in all regions except North America in 2007.  Group sales
in Europe grew 7 % on a currency-neutral basis as a result
of strong growth in the region's emerging markets.  In North
America,  Group sales declined 2 % on a currency-neutral basis
due to lower Reebok sales in the USA.  Sales for the adidas
Group in Asia increased 18 % on a currency-neutral basisdriven by growth in China.  In Latin America,  sales grew 38 %
on a currency-neutral basis,  with increases coming from all
of the region's major markets. 
Currency translation effects negatively impacted sales in euro
terms in all regions.  In euro terms,  sales in Europe increased
 % to € 4369 billion in 2007 from € 4162 billion in 2006.  Sales
in North America decreased 9 % to € 2929 billion in 2007
from € 3234 billion in the prior year.  Revenues in Asia grew
12 % to € 2254 billion in 2007 from € 2020 billion in 2006. 
Sales in Latin America grew 32 % to € 657 million in 2007
from € 499 million in the prior year. 
GROUP APPAREL SALES GROW STRONGLY From a product
category perspective,  Group sales growth in the year was
largely driven by the apparel category.  Currency-neutral footwear sales grew solidly and increased 5 % during the period. 
Strong increases in the adidas and TaylorMade-adidas Golf
segments were partly offset by declines in the Reebok segment.  Apparel sales grew 11 % on a currency-neutral basis. 
Increases in the adidas and Reebok segments were partly offset by a decrease at TaylorMade-adidas Golf.  In this segmentincreases in adidas Golf apparel sales were more than offset
by negative impacts from the divestiture of the GNC wholesale
business.  Currency-neutral hardware sales were stable compared to the prior year.  Increases at TaylorMade-adidas Golf
were offset by declines in the adidas and Reebok segments.

COST OF SALES DECLINES 3 % Cost of sales is defined as the
amount we pay to third parties for expenses associated with
producing and delivering our products.  Own-production expenses
at adidas and Reebok as well as assembling expenses at
TaylorMade-adidas Golf are also included in the Group's cost
of sales.  However,  these expenses represent only a very
small portion of total cost of sales.  In 2007,  cost of sales was
€ 5417 billion,  representing a decrease of 3 % from € 5589 billion in 2006,  despite higher sourcing volumes compared to the
prior year.  This improvement is the result of cost synergies from
the combination of adidas and Reebok sourcing activities.  The
optimization of sourcing processes and efficiency gains within
our supply chain more than offset increasing labor and raw
material costs.

GROSS MARGIN INCREASES BY 28 PERCENTAGE POINTS
The gross margin of the adidas Group increased by 28 percentage points to 474 % in 2007 (2006: 446 %).  This development exceeded Management's initial expectation of a gross
margin between 45 and 47 %.  The non-recurrence of negative
impacts from purchase price allocation in the Reebok segment,  which in 2006 amounted to € 76 million,  positively
impacted gross margin development.  Cost synergies resulting
from the combination of adidas and Reebok sourcing activities as well as underlying improvements in all segments also
contributed to this development.  As a result,  gross profit for
the adidas Group rose 9 % in 2007 to reach € 4882 billion
versus € 4495 billion in the prior year.

of this increase.  The consolidation of the month of January in

HIGHER EXPENSES AT REEBOK DRIVE OPERATING EXPENSE
INCREASE Operating expenses include marketing working
budget and operating overhead costs as well as depreciation
and amortization.  Operating expenses as a percentage of sales
increased by 25 percentage points to 392 % in 2007 from
367 % in 2006.  This increase primarily reflects one-time costs
related to the integration of Reebok into the adidas Group as
well as higher expenses in the Reebok segment for advertisingproduct development and initiatives to grow the brand in
emerging markets.  In absolute terms,  operating expenses for
the adidas Group increased by 9 % to € 4035 billion in 2007
from € 3704 billion in the prior year. 
MARKETING WORKING BUDGET INCREASES AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES Almost half of our Group's marketing working
budget is variable to increase the flexibility of our Group.  The
variable portion primarily includes expenses for advertisingretail presentation and public relations,  whereas the fixed portion consists mainly of expenses for promotion partnerships. 
Marketing working budget as a percentage of sales increased
05 percentage points to 134 % in 2007 (2006: 129 %).  adidas
marketing working budget as a percentage of sales remained
stable.  Reebok's marketing working budget as a percentage of
sales increased to support the revitalization of the brand. 
However,  Reebok's marketing working budget continues to be
below the Group average.  Marketing expenditure as a percentage of sales at TaylorMade-adidas Golf grew compared to the
prior year as a result of the divestiture of the GNC wholesale
business,  which had lower marketing expenditures as a percentage of sales.

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR FINANCIAL YEAR - Group Business Performance  Income Statement 
ANNUAL REPORT 2007 -- adidas Group 
OPERATING OVERHEADS INCREASE AS A PERCENTAGE OF
SALES Group operating overheads include overhead costs
related to marketing,  sales,  logistics,  research and development as well as central finance and administration functions. 
Operating overhead expenses as a percentage of sales increased 22 percentage points to 260 % in 2007 from 238 %
in the prior year.  This was primarily a result of higher ownretail expenditures,  which increased in line with the expansion
of the Group's own-retail activities.  Central finance and administration expenses also grew overproportionately due to
integration expenses in the Group's Headquarter functions. 
However,  research and development expenditure decreased
as a result of the combination of certain adidas and Reebok
research capabilities.  see Research and Development,  p.  072
EBITDA UP 8 % The Group's earnings before interest,  taxesdepreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible
assets (EBITDA) increased 8 % to € 1165 billion in 2007
(2006: € 1078 billion).  Depreciation and amortization expense
for tangible and intangible assets with limited useful lives
grew 1 % to € 211 million in 2007 (2006: € 209 million).  In
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standardsintangible assets with unlimited useful lives (goodwill and
trademarks) are tested annually and additionally when there
are indications of potential impairment.  No impairment of
intangible assets was incurred in 2007 and 2006. 
OPERATING MARGIN REACHES 92 % The operating margin
of the adidas Group increased 05 percentage points to 92 %
in 2007 (2006: 87 %).  This development was in line with initial
Management expectations of an operating margin around 9 %. 
The operating margin increase is a result of the Group's gross
margin improvement,  which more than offset higher operating
expenses as a percentage of sales.  As a result,  Group operating profit increased 8 % in 2007 to reach € 949 million versus
€ 881 million in 2006.

STRONG DECREASE OF NET FINANCIAL EXPENSES Net financial expenses decreased 15 % to € 134 million in 2007 from

FINANCIAL INCOME DECLINES BY 9 % Financial income
decreased by 9 % to € 36 million in 2007 (2006: € 39 million). 
In the prior year,  financial income was higher due to a significant cash position after the capital increase and the proceeds
related to the divestiture of the Salomon business segment
at the beginning of 2006.  Both transactions were completed in
the fourth quarter of 2005. 
FINANCIAL EXPENSES DECREASE BY 14 % Financial expenses
decreased 14 % to € 170 million in 2007 (2006: € 197 million)mainly as a result of significantly lower gross borrowings versus the prior year. 
INCOME BEFORE TAXES INCREASES BY 13 % As a result of the
Group's operating margin increase and lower net financial
expenses,  income before taxes (IBT) as a percentage of sales
increased by 07 percentage points to 79 % in 2007 from 72 %
in 2006.  IBT for the adidas Group increased 13 % to € 815 million in 2007 from € 723 million in 2006.

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR FINANCIAL YEAR - Group Business Performance  Income Statement 
ANNUAL REPORT 2007 -- adidas Group 
NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO SHAREHOLDERS GROWS 14 %
The Group's net income attributable to shareholders increased
14 % to € 551 million in 2007 from € 483 million in 2006.  This
development was in line with initial Management expectations
that targeted an increase at a rate approaching 15 %.  The Group's
higher operating profit,  lower net financial expenses and
lower minority interests each contributed to this development. 
The Group's tax rate increased by 04 percentage points to
318 % in 2007 (2006: 314 %).  The non-recurrence of a one-time
tax benefit,  which had a positive impact in the prior year,  was
partly compensated for by favorable tax rate changes in several
countries.  see Note 27,  p.  185
MINORITY INTERESTS DECLINE BY 71 % The Group's minority
interests decreased 71 % to € 4 million in 2007 from € 13 million in 2006.  The strong decline in minority interests compared
to the prior year was primarily due to the buyout of the adidas
joint venture partner in Korea.  Effective September 1,  2006the Group purchased the remaining 49 % of shares.

BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE BOTH INCREASE
14 % In line with the increase of the Group's net income attributable to shareholders,  basic earnings per share increased
14 % to € 271 in 2007 versus € 237 in 2006.  The Group's total
number of shares outstanding increased by 92100 shares to
203628960 at the end of 2007 from 203536860 at the end of
2006 as a result of shares from stock options exercised as part
of Tranches II,  III,  IV and V of the Management Share Option
Plan (MSOP) of adidas AG.  Consequently,  the weighted average
number of shares used in the calculation of basic earnings per
share was 203594975 (2006 average: 203386104).  Diluted
earnings per share in 2007 also increased 14 % to € 257 from
€ 225 in the prior year.  The weighted average number of
shares used in the calculation of diluted earnings per share
was 219467177 (2006 average: 219399522).  The number of
diluted shares outstanding at year-end 2007 was 219485875
(2006: 219485875).  The dilutive effect largely results from
approximately sixteen million additional potential shares that
could be created in relation to our outstanding convertible
bond,  for which conversion criteria were first met at the end
of the fourth quarter of 2004.

TOTAL ASSETS DECREASE 1 % At the end of 2007,  total assets
decreased 1 % to € 8325 billion versus € 8379 billion in the
prior year,  mainly due to currency effects which had a negative
impact on the Group's US dollar-denominated assets. 
INVENTORIES UP 1 % Group inventories increased 1 % to
€ 1629 billion at the end of 2007 versus € 1607 billion in 2006. 
On a currency-neutral basis,  inventories grew 7 %.  The
increase was driven by higher inventory levels in emerging
markets,  reflecting the Group's high sales growth expectations
for these countries in particular. 
RECEIVABLES INCREASE 3 % At the end of 2007,  Group receivables increased 3 % to € 1459 billion (2006: € 1415 billion). 
On a currency-neutral basis,  receivables grew 8 %.  This is well
below sales growth in the fourth quarter of 2007 and reflects
strict discipline in the Group's trade terms management and
concerted collection efforts in all segments.

FIXED ASSETS DECREASE 7 % Fixed assets decreased by
 % to € 3726 billion at the end of 2007 versus € 3988 billion
in 2006.  This was mainly due to € 286 million of negative
currency translation effects on fixed assets held in currencies
other than the euro.  In addition,  the transfer of € 17 million of
fixed assets to assets held-for-sale impacted this development. 
Additions of € 295 million were partly offset by depreciation and
amortization of € 215 million as well as disposals in an amount
of € 37 million.

OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES GROW 15 % Other current liabilities increased 15 % to € 266 million at the end of 2007 from

EXPENSES RELATED TO OFF-BALANCE SHEET ITEMS Our
most important off-balance sheet assets are operating leaseswhich are related to retail stores,  offices,  warehouses and
equipment.  The Group has entered into various operating
leases as opposed to property acquisitions to reduce exposure
to property value fluctuations.  Rent expenses increased 21 %
to € 337 million in 2007 from € 278 million in the prior yearmainly due to the continued expansion of adidas own-retail
activities. 

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOCUS ON OWN-RETAIL ACTIVITIES
Capital expenditure is the total cash expenditure for the purchase of tangible and intangible assets and the construction
of tangible assets.  Group capital expenditures increased 4 % to
€ 289 million in 2007 (2006: € 277 million).  The adidas segment accounted for 52 % of Group capital expenditures (2006:
49 %).  Expenditures in the Reebok segment accounted for
20 % of total expenditures (2006: 26 %).  The majority of adidas
and Reebok expenditures focused on the expansion of ownretail activities.  TaylorMade-adidas Golf capital expenditures
accounted for 4 % of total expenditures (2006: 5 %).  The
remaining 24 % of total capital expenditures was recorded
in the HQ / Consolidation segment (2006: 20 %) and was mainly
related to integration initiatives such as the construction of
the shared warehouse facility in the UK and the Group-wide
harmonization of IT systems. 

CASH FLOW DEVELOPMENT REFLECTS OPERATIONAL
STRENGTH In 2007,  cash inflow from operating activities was
€ 780 million.  It was primarily used to finance working capital
needs in accordance with the seasonality of our business. 
Cash outflow for investing activities was € 285 million and was
mainly related to spending for property,  plant and equipment
such as investment in the furnishing and fitting of adidas
and Reebok own-retail stores.  In addition,  investments also
related to the Reebok integration.  Major integration projects
included the construction of the shared adidas and Reebok
warehousing and distribution center in the UK.  Cash outflow
for financing activities totaled € 510 million and was related
to the payment of dividends as well as the reduction of longterm borrowings.  Operating activities provided less cash than
used in investing and financing activities.  As a result of this
development and a negative exchange rate effect of € 1 million,  cash and cash equivalents decreased by € 16 million to
€ 295 million at the end of 2007 (2006: € 311 million).

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT  OUR FINANCIAL YEAR - Group Business Performance  Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Statement  Treasury 
ANNUAL REPORT 2007 -- adidas Group 
TREASURY
GROUP FINANCING POLICY The major goal of our financing
policy is to minimize the Group's financial expenses while
ensuring sufficient liquidity reserves at all times to meet the
Group's payment commitments.  The operating activities of our
Group segments and the resulting cash inflows represent the
Group's main source of liquidity.  Liquidity is planned on a
multi-year financial and liquidity plan on a rolling monthly
basis.  This comprises all consolidated Group companies.  Our
in-house bank concept takes advantage of the surplus funds
of individual Group companies to cover the financial requirements of others,  reducing external financing requirements
and optimizing our net interest expenses.  By settling intercompany transactions via inter-company financial accountswe are able to reduce external bank account transactions and
thus bank charges.  Currency management as well as ongoing
interest rate optimization are additional goals of our Group
Treasury department. 
TREASURY SYSTEM AND RESPONSIBILITIES Our Group's
Treasury Policy governs all treasury-related issues,  including
banking policy and approval of bank relationships,  global
financing arrangements and liquidity / asset managementcurrency and interest risk management as well as the management of inter-company cash flows.  Responsibilities are
arranged in a three-tiered approach:


The Treasury Committee consists of members of the
Executive Board and other senior executives who decide
on the Group's Treasury Policy and provide strategic guidance
for managing treasury-related topics.  The Treasury Committee
approves all major changes to our Treasury Policy. 


The Group Treasury department is responsible for specific
centralized treasury transactions and for global implementation of our Group's Treasury Policy. 


On a subsidiary level,  local managing directors and financial
controllers are responsible for managing treasury matters in
the respective subsidiaries.  Brand and regional controlling
ensures that the transactions of the individual business units
are in compliance with the Group's Treasury Policy. 
CENTRALIZED TREASURY FUNCTION In accordance with our
Group's Treasury Policy,  more than 90 % of our worldwide
credit lines are managed by the Group Treasury department. 
Portions of those lines are allocated to the Group's subsidiaries and backed by parental guarantees.  As a result of this
centralized liquidity management,  the Group is well positioned
to allocate resources efficiently throughout the organization. 
The Group's debt is generally unsecured and includes standard
financial covenants,  which are reviewed on a quarterly basis. 
We maintain good relations with numerous partner banksthereby avoiding a strong dependency on any single institution. 
Banking partners of the Group and our subsidiaries are
required to have at least a BBB+ long-term investment grade
rating by Standard & Poor's or an equivalent rating by another
leading rating agency.  Only in exceptional cases are Group companies and subsidiaries authorized to work with banks with a
lower rating.  see Risk and Opportunity Report,  p.  104 To optimize the
Group's cash position and ensure optimal allocation of liquid
financial resources,  subsidiaries are required to transfer
excess cash to the Group's headquarters. 
LONG-TERM FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY ENSURED The adidas
Group's long-term flexibility is ensured by unutilized financial
instruments in an amount of € 41 billion at the end of 2007
(2006: € 44 billion).  These instruments include a € 20 billion
multi-year syndicated loan (2006: € 20 billion) as well as bilateral
credit lines at different banks in an amount of € 21 billion
(2006: € 24 billion).  The reduction of unutilized credit lines
in 2007 reflects the decreased need for financial flexibility
as a result of the Group's strong progress in gross borrowings
reduction in 2007.  We monitor the ongoing need for available
credit lines based on the current level of debt as well as future
financing requirements.

STANDARD FINANCIAL COVENANTS Under our committed
credit facilities we have entered into various covenants.  These
covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets and the
amount of debt secured by liens we may incur.  In addition,  our
financial arrangements contain equity ratio covenants,  minimum equity covenants as well as net loss covenants.  If we fail
to meet any covenant and are unable to obtain a waiver from
 majority of partner banks,  borrowings would become due
and payable immediately.  As at December 31,  2007,  we were
in full compliance with all of our covenants.  Going forward,  we
are highly confident that we will continue to be compliant with
these covenants as we expect sustainable strong cash flows for
the foreseeable future.  see Outlook,  p.  118 We currently believe
that cash generated by operations,  together with access to
external sources of funds,  will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital needs in the foreseeable future. 
GROSS BORROWINGS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED Gross
borrowings decreased by 17 % to € 2146 billion at the end of
2007 from € 2578 billion in the prior year.  Bank borrowings
decreased 28 % to € 198 million from € 275 million in the prior
year.  Our private placements in the USA,  in Europe and in Asia
decreased 12 % to € 1564 billion in 2007 (2006: € 1784 billion). 
The current value of the convertible bond increased 2 % to
€ 384 million in 2007 from € 375 million in the prior yearreflecting the accrued interest on the debt component in
accordance with IFRS requirements.  No commercial paper was
outstanding at the end of 2007 (2006: € 144 million).

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT  OUR FINANCIAL YEAR - Group Business Performance  Treasury 
CURRENCY MIX BROADLY UNCHANGED The majority of our
Group's gross borrowings are denominated in euros and US
dollars.  In an effort to minimize the level of short-term variable
interest rate borrowings,  2007 debt reduction was targeted at
euro-denominated instruments,  which are mainly variable-rate
financing arrangements.  In addition,  our US dollar-denominated
financing declined in absolute terms mainly as a result of the
US dollar depreciation versus the euro.  Consequently,  the
currency split of our gross borrowings at the end of 2007 was
broadly unchanged versus the prior year.  Gross borrowings
denominated in euros accounted for 51 % of total gross
borrowings (2006: 51 %).  The share of gross borrowings held

INTEREST RATE INCREASES The weighted average interest
rate on the Group's gross borrowings rose 05 percentage
points to 53 % in 2007 (2006: 48%),  mainly as a result of higher
interest rates in the Euro Zone.  As a result,  our debt reduction
in 2007 focused primarily on decreasing the Group's variable
financing arrangements to better protect against future interest
rates increases.  see Risk and Opportunity Report,  p.  104 Long-term
fixed-rate financing amounted to around 70 % of the Group's
total financing at the end of 2007 (2006: around 65 %).  Variable
financing amounted to around 30 % of total financing at the
end of the year (2006: around 35 %).

NET DEBT POSITION REDUCED BY NEARLY € 500 MILLION
Net borrowings at December 31,  2007 amounted to
€ 1766 billion,  which represents a reduction of € 465 millionor 21%,  versus € 2231 billion in the prior year.  This improvement was significantly better than our original target of
below € 2 billion as communicated at the beginning of 2007. 
see Internal Group Management System,  p.  056 The Group's strong profitability improvement and continued tight working capital
management were the primary drivers of this decline.  In addition,  positive currency effects contributed € 98 million to
the net borrowings improvement.  Consequently,  the Group's
financial leverage also improved significantly to 584 % at the
end of 2007 versus 789 % in the prior year.  On a net debt basisthe utilization of the available credit facilities for the Group at
the end of 2007 was 28 % versus 32 % in the prior year.

CURRENCY MANAGEMENT FURTHER OPTIMIZED Due to the
Group's global activity,  currency management is a key focus of
the Group's central Treasury department.  Hedging US dollars is
the central pillar of our program.  This is a direct result of our
Asian-dominated sourcing,  which is largely denominated in US
dollars.  see Global Operations,  p.  062 In 2007,  the central Treasury
department managed a net deficit of around US $ 15 billion
against the euro.  This represents a decrease of approximately
US $ 200 million from around US $ 17 billion in the prior yearmainly as a result of the non-recurrence of a one-time effect
related to the Reebok acquisition in 2006.  As outlined in our
Group's Treasury Policy,  we have established a rolling 12 to
18 months hedging system,  under which a large amount of the
anticipated seasonal hedging volume is secured six months
prior to the start of a season.  As a result,  we have already completed around 70 % of our anticipated hedging needs for 2008
at higher rates than those of 2007 and we have already started
to hedge our exposure for 2009.  The use or combination
of different hedging instruments,  such as currency optionsswaps and forward contracts,  protects us against unfavorable
currency movements,  while retaining the potential to benefit
from future favorable exchange rate developments.

ADIDAS BUSINESS PERFORMANCE In 2007sales growth in the adidas segment exceeded
Management's initial expectations,  while profitability developed in line with expectations. 
Currency-neutral sales in the adidas segment
increased 12 %.  In euro terms,  sales grew 7 %
to € 7113 billion in 2007 from € 6626 billion in
2006.  Gross margin increased 12 percentage
points to 474 % (2006: 462 %),  mainly driven by
the realization of cost synergies related to the
Reebok acquisition and own-retail expansion. 
Gross profit grew 10 % to € 3370 billion in 2007
from € 3059 billion in 2006.  As a result of the
positive gross margin development,  which
more than offset a slight increase in operating
expenses as a percentage of sales,  operating
margin increased 10 percentage points to
129 % (2006: 119 %).  Operating profit increased
17 % to € 920 million in 2007 versus € 788 million in 2006.

TRANSFER OF LICENSED BUSINESSES HAS ONLY MINOR
IMPACT ON OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE The transfer of the
NBA and Liverpool licensed businesses from Reebok to brand
adidas in the first half of 2006 had only a minor effect on sales
growth in the adidas segment.  Sales related to these businesses
accounted for around one percentage point of total sales
growth in the adidas segment. 
CURRENCY-NEUTRAL SEGMENT SALES GROW 12 % Revenues
for the adidas segment grew 12 % on a currency-neutral basis. 
This development clearly exceeded Management's initial
expectation of a mid-single-digit sales increase.  Both apparel
and footwear revenues increased strongly.  Hardware saleshowever,  declined.  Currency translation effects negatively
impacted segment revenues in euro terms.  Sales grew 7 % to
€ 7113 billion in 2007 from € 6626 billion in 2006. 
ADIDAS DIVISIONS REALIGNED During 2007,  adidas realigned
its business into two divisions.  see adidas Strategy,  p.  046 The Sport
Performance division accounted for 80 % of adidas sales
(2006: 78 %).  The Sport Style division,  which merged our Sport
Heritage and Sport Style activities to sharpen brand image
and improve consumer targeting in sports lifestyle,  comprised
20 % of segment sales (2006: 22 %). 
SPORT PERFORMANCE UP 14 % ON A CURRENCY-NEUTRAL
BASIS Sales in the Sport Performance division increased 14 %
on a currency-neutral basis in 2007.  The key categories identified by brand management as medium-term growth drivers
see adidas Strategy,  p.  046 contributed the majority of this increasewith particularly strong growth in the running and training
categories.  In euro terms,  Sport Performance sales improved
10 % in 2007 to € 5608 billion from € 5100 billion in the
prior year. 

ANNUAL REPORT 2007 -- adidas Group 
SPORT STYLE INCREASES 3 % ON A CURRENCY-NEUTRAL

currency-neutral basis in 2007.  Sales in Originals increased
moderately compared to the prior year.  While revenues in the
Metropolitan category declined,  sales in the Urban and Coastal
categories increased.  Y-3 and the launch of Porsche Design also
contributed to divisional growth.  In euro terms,  Sport Style sales
declined 1 % to € 1455 billion in 2007 (2006: € 1470 billion).

CURRENCY-NEUTRAL ADIDAS SALES GROW IN ALL REGIONS
In 2007,  adidas sales increased in all regions on a currencyneutral basis.  Revenues in Europe grew 8 %.  Strong performance
in the region's emerging markets,  in particular Russia,  was the
primary driver of this development.  Currency-neutral adidas
sales in North America increased 5 %.  Revenues grew in both
the USA and Canada.  adidas sales in Asia improved 17 % on
 currency-neutral basis,  due to double-digit increases in all
major markets except Japan.  Sales growth in China was particularly strong.  In Latin America,  sales grew 39 %,  again making
it the fastest-growing region within the adidas segment.  All markets in this region grew at double-digit rates.  Currency translation effects negatively impacted sales in euro terms in all
regions.  Sales in Europe grew 7 % in euro terms to € 3526 billion in 2007 from € 3302 billion in 2006.  Revenues in North
America decreased 3 % to € 1275 billion in 2007 from € 1321 billion in 2006.  Sales in Asia increased 11 % to € 1703 billion in

In euro terms,  revenues grew 22 % to € 1229 billion from
€ 1009 billion in 2006.  This increase was driven by new store
openings and mid-single-digit increases in comparable store
sales.  adidas own-retail activities made up 17 % of brand sales
in 2007,  up from 15 % in the prior year.  The store base at the
end of 2007 comprised 542 concept stores,  317 factory outlets
and 142 concession corners.  During the year,  adidas opened
128 concept stores and 61 factory outlets.  The majority of new
stores were opened in emerging markets with under-developed
retail infrastructure.  The number of concession corners was
61 below the prior year,  mainly due to the transfer of concession
corners in the Philippines to a distributor.  Major openings
in 2007 included Sport Performance Concept Stores in BeijingBuenos Aires and Istanbul as well as Originals Concept Stores
in Shanghai,  Montreal and Liverpool.

GROSS MARGIN IMPROVES TO 474 % The adidas gross margin
increased by 12 percentage points to 474 % in 2007 from 462 %
in 2006.  This development was in line with Management's initial
expectation of a gross margin improvement.  The increase was
primarily driven by cost synergies resulting from the combination
of adidas and Reebok sourcing activities,  which positively
impacted the segment's cost of sales.  Improvements due to
increased own-retail activities also contributed to this development.  As a result,  adidas gross profit grew 10 % to € 3370 billion in 2007 versus € 3059 billion in 2006. 
ROYALTY AND COMMISSION INCOME UP 8 % In 2007,  adidas
royalty and commission income grew by 8 % to € 80 million
from € 74 million in 2006.  This increase was a result of higher
external licensee sales.  Higher average royalty rates also
supported growth.  In addition,  increased intra-Group royalties
received from the TaylorMade-adidas Golf segment due to
strong adidas Golf sales contributed to this development.  adidas
royalty and commission income relates,  for example,  to royalty
income for cosmetics,  watches and glasses.

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR FINANCIAL YEAR - Business Performance by Segment  adidas Business Performance  Reebok Business Performance 
ANNUAL REPORT 2007 -- adidas Group 
REEBOK BUSINESS PERFORMANCE In 2007Reebok made important progress in revitalizing the brand.  While sales were below Management's expectations,  profitability developed in
line with Management's expectations.  Currencyneutral sales for the Reebok segment were
stable.  In euro terms,  this development represents a decrease of 6 % to € 2333 billion in
2007 from € 2473 billion in 2006.  On a like-forlike basis,  sales declined 5 %.  The gross margin
of the Reebok segment grew by 37 percentage
points to 387 % in 2007 from 350 % in 2006. 
This increase was driven by the non-recurrence
of negative purchase price allocation impacts
and cost synergies from the combination of the
adidas and Reebok sourcing activities,  which
possitively impacted the segment's cost of
sales.  In euro terms,  Reebok's gross profit grew
 % to € 902 million in 2007 versus € 865 million in 2006.  Reebok's operating margin
increased by 12 percentage points to 47 % in
2007 from 35 % in the prior year,  as a result of
the positive gross margin development,  which
was partly offset by higher operating expenses
as a percentage of sales.  As a result,  Reebok's
operating profit increased by 27 % to € 109 million in 2007 versus € 86 million in the prior year.

TWELVE MONTHS OF REEBOK RESULTS CONSOLIDATED
IN 2007 Several factors impact the comparison of Reebok's
financial results to the prior year.  In 2006,  only eleven months
were consolidated due to the acquisition date (February 1,  2006). 
In 2007,  twelve months of Reebok's results were consolidated. 
This had a positive impact on the comparison of Reebok segment
sales to the prior year.  The segment's gross and operating
margins,  however,  were negatively affected,  as the month of
January is traditionally characterized by higher-than-average
clearance activities.  The first-time inclusion of the Greg Norman
Collection (GNC)-related sales which were generated through
Reebok's own-retail outlets also positively affected the segment's revenue development.  These operations were excluded
from the divestiture of the GNC business and transferred from
the TaylorMade-adidas Golf to the Reebok segment,  effective
January 1,  2007.  However,  the transfer of the NBA and Liverpool
licensed businesses to brand adidas in the first half of 2006
had a negative effect on the segment's sales development. 
Purchase price allocation charges also negatively impacted
Reebok's results,  however to a significantly lesser extent compared to the prior year. 
SEGMENT SALES STABLE ON A CURRENCY-NEUTRAL BASIS
In 2007,  sales for the Reebok segment were stable on a currencyneutral basis.  This development was below Management's
initial expectation of a low-single-digit sales increase.  It was
 result of the weakening market situation in Reebok's most
important market,  the USA,  during 2007.  While apparel revenues grew,  footwear and hardware sales decreased.  The firsttime inclusion of January,  which was not consolidated in 2006
due to the timing of the acquisition,  had a positive impact on
revenues.  Incremental sales increases in several countries for
which Reebok had purchased the distribution rights,  in particular Russia and China,  also contributed to this development. 
Distribution buybacks were made to better control brand
management and gain market share.  see Reebok Strategy,  p.  050

the full year periods of both 2006 and 2007.  It also includes
GNC retail sales which were transferred from TaylorMadeadidas Golf to the Reebok segment,  effective January 1,  2007. 
However,  it excludes revenues related to the NBA and

ROCKPORT SALES GROW 7 % ON A CURRENCY-NEUTRAL
BASIS Rockport sales increased 7 % on a currency-neutral
basis in 2007,  driven by several new product launches including
the Rockport with adidas TORSION® collection.  The inclusion of
January,  which was not consolidated in 2006,  also supported
this development.  In euro terms,  Rockport revenues were
almost stable at € 291 million in 2007 (2006: € 293 million). 
On a like-for-like basis,  comparing sales for the full year
periods of both 2006 and 2007,  sales increased 1 %. 

CURRENCY-NEUTRAL SALES OF REEBOK-CCM HOCKEY UP 9 %
Sales of Reebok-CCM Hockey increased 9 % on a currencyneutral basis in 2007.  In addition to higher sales in apparel and
sticks,  revenue growth was supported by the first-time inclusion
of January.  This month was not consolidated in 2006.  In euro
terms,  sales grew 4 % to reach € 210 million in 2007 versus
€ 202 million in the prior year.  On a like-for-like basis,  comparing sales for the full year periods of both 2006 and 2007sales increased 3 %. 

STRONG SEGMENT SALES GROWTH IN EMERGING MARKETS
In 2007,  currency-neutral Reebok segment sales increased at a
double-digit rate in both Asia and Latin America,  but decreased
in Europe and North America.  In Europe,  currency-neutral
sales declined 1 %.  Revenues in North America were down 5 %. 
In Asia and in Latin America,  currency-neutral sales increased
24 % and 32 %,  respectively.  Reebok's sales development was
supported by the inclusion of January,  which was not consolidated in 2006.  In euro terms,  segment sales in Europe decreased
 % to € 748 million in 2007 from € 768 million in 2006.  In North
America,  revenues decreased 13 % to € 1231 billion in 2007
from € 1408 billion in 2006.  Sales in Asia grew 18 % to € 269 million in 2007 (2006: € 229 million),  and in Latin America revenues
increased 21 % to € 84 million in 2007 (2006: € 69 million). 
On a like-for-like basis,  Reebok segment sales declined by 5 %. 
In Europe,  like-for-like sales declined mainly due to a decrease
in the UK which could only be partly offset by improvements in
the region's emerging markets.  In North America,  like-for-like
sales were down as a result of declines in both the USA and
Canada.  In Asia,  like-for-like sales increased due to strong
growth in China and India.  In Latin America,  like-for-like sales
were up as a result of strong sales growth,  particularly in
Mexico and Chile.

CURRENCY-NEUTRAL SALES OF BRAND REEBOK DOWN 2 %
Brand Reebok sales decreased 2 % on a currency-neutral
basis.  Declines in lifestyle and in most major sports categories
except running led to this development.  The transfer of the
NBA and Liverpool licensed businesses to brand adidas also
negatively impacted sales.  In euro terms,  sales decreased 7 %
to € 1831 billion (2006: € 1979 billion).  On a like-for-like

CURRENCY-NEUTRAL OWN-RETAIL SALES GROW 31 %
In 2007,  Reebok own-retail sales grew 31 % on a currency-neutral
basis.  In euro terms,  revenues increased 22 % to € 371 million
from € 304 million in 2006.  The first-time inclusion of Januarywhich was not consolidated in 2006 due to the timing of the
acquisition,  had a positive impact on revenue growth.  On a likefor-like basis,  comparing sales for the full year periods of
both 2006 and 2007,  Reebok own-retail sales increased 23 %. 
Reebok own-retail activities made up 16 % of Reebok segment
sales in 2007,  up from 12 % in the prior year.  The share of ownretail activities as a percentage of brand sales at Rockport was
significantly above the segment average.  The store base at
the end of 2007 comprised 142 concept stores and 288 factory
outlets.  During the year,  Reebok opened 95 concept stores and
52 factory outlets.  Major openings in 2007 included concept
stores in Hong Kong and Moscow. 
REEBOK SEGMENT GROSS MARGIN SUPPORTED BY REALIZATION OF COST SYNERGIES The gross margin of the Reebok
segment increased 37 percentage points to 387 % in 2007
from 350 % in 2006.  This development was in line with
Management's initial expectation of a gross margin increase. 
The improvement was driven by the non-recurrence of negative
impacts from purchase price allocation.  In 2006,  these charges
amounted to € 76 million.  In addition,  cost synergies in the
segment's cost of sales resulting from the combination of
adidas and Reebok sourcing activities had a positive effect. 
 shift in the segment's sales mix towards regions with
higher margins was partly offset by negative effects from
selective clearance initiatives in North America.  In euro
terms,  Reebok gross profit grew 4 % to € 902 million in 2007
versus € 865 million in 2006.

ROYALTY AND COMMISSION INCOME INCREASES In 2007Reebok royalty and commission income grew 24 % to € 42 million from € 34 million in the prior year.  This improvement was
mainly due to the first-time inclusion of January revenues. 
Higher royalty rates also contributed to the increase.  Reebok's
royalty and commission income primarily relates to royalty
income for fitness equipment.

OPERATING EXPENSES INCREASE Operating expenses as a
percentage of sales increased by 30 percentage points to 358 %
in 2007 versus 328 % in 2006.  Additional expenses amounting
to around € 50 million for marketing,  product development and
initiatives to grow the brand in emerging markets drove this
increase.  These expenses mainly impacted the first half of the
year.  The majority was spent for the brand's largest advertising
campaign of the year,  'Run Easy".  see Reebok Strategy,  p.  050 Onetime costs for the Reebok integration into the adidas Group
also negatively affected operating overhead development.  The
negative effect from purchase price allocation on operating
expenses was € 12 million in 2007 (2006: € 13 million).  Reebok's
operating expenses grew 3 % to € 835 million in 2007 from
€ 812 million in the prior year.

TAYLORMADE-ADIDAS GOLF BUSINESS
PERFORMANCE In 2007,  sales growth in the
TaylorMade-adidas Golf segment exceeded
Management's initial expectations.  Profitability
developed in line with expectations.  TaylorMadeadidas Golf revenues increased 1 % on a
currency-neutral basis despite the divestiture
of the Greg Norman Collection (GNC) wholesale business in November 2006.  In euro
terms,  segment sales declined 6 % to € 804
million in 2007 from € 856 million in 2006. 
On a like-for-like basis,  however,  sales
increased 9 %.  The segment's gross margin
grew 08 percentage points to 447 % (2006:
439 %) as a result of higher margins in metalwoods and irons.  In euro terms,  gross profit
declined 4 % to € 360 million in 2007 from
€ 376 million in the prior year.  The segment's
operating margin decreased 04 percentage
points to 81 % (2006: 85 %).  This was due to
higher operating expenses as a percentage
of sales,  which more than offset the positive
gross margin development.  As a resultoperating profit decreased 10 % to € 65 million
from € 73 million in 2006.

GNC DIVESTITURE AFFECTS REPORTED RESULTS Compared
to the prior year,  2007 results of the TaylorMade-adidas Golf
segment do not include results of the GNC apparel business. 
This is due to the divestiture of the GNC wholesale businesswhich was completed on November 21,  2006.  In additionresults of the GNC-related retail outlet operations,  which were
excluded from the transaction,  are now reported in the Reebok
business segment.  These operations relate to the distribution
of GNC products via Reebok own-retail stores.  The divestiture
had a negative impact on the segment's sales development. 
In total,  the GNC apparel business contributed € 63 million of
sales to the TaylorMade-adidas Golf segment in 2006. 
CURRENCY-NEUTRAL SALES INCREASE 1 % Currency-neutral
sales at TaylorMade-adidas Golf in 2007 increased 1 % despite

OPERATING EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES INCREASE
Operating expenses as a percentage of sales at TaylorMadeadidas Golf increased 09 percentage points to 344 % in 2007
from 335 % in 2006.  A main reason for this increase was the
divestiture of the GNC wholesale business,  which had lower
marketing expenditures as a percentage of sales.  Operating

RISK AND OPPORTUNITY REPORT The adidas
Group continuously explores and develops
opportunities to sustain and maximize earnings
and also to drive long-term increases in shareholder value.  In doing so,  we acknowledge that
it is necessary to take certain risks to maximize business opportunities.  Our risk and
opportunity management principles provide
the framework for our Group to conduct business in a well-controlled environment. 

RISK AND OPPORTUNITY MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES The
adidas Group is regularly confronted with risks and opportunities which have the potential to negatively or positively
impact the Group's asset value,  earnings,  cash flow strengthor intangible values such as brand image.  We have summarized the most important of these risks and opportunities
in this report in three main categories: External and IndustryStrategic and Operational,  and Financial. 
We define risk as the potential occurrence of external or internal events that may negatively impact our ability to achieve
short-term goals or long-term strategies.  Risks also include
lost or poorly utilized opportunities.

Opportunities are broadly defined as internal and external
strategic and operational developments that have the potential
to positively impact the Group if properly exploited. 
RISK AND OPPORTUNITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM To facilitate
effective management,  we have implemented an integrated
management system which focuses on the identificationassessment,  treatment,  controlling and reporting of risks and
opportunities.  The key objective of this system is to protect
and further grow shareholder value through an opportunityfocused,  but risk-aware decision-making framework. 
We believe that risk and opportunity management is optimized
when risks,  risk-compensating measures and opportunities
are identified and assessed where they arise,  in conjunction
with a concerted approach to controlling,  aggregating and
reporting.  Therefore,  risk and opportunity management is a
Group-wide activity,  which utilizes critical day-to-day management insight from local and regional business units.  Support
and strategic direction is provided by brand and global functions.  Centralized risk management is responsible for the
alignment of various corporate functions in the risk and opportunity management process and coordinates the involvement
of the Executive and Supervisory Boards as necessary. 
Centralized risk management is also responsible for providing
line management with relevant tools and know-how to aggregate and control risks and opportunities utilizing a consistent
methodology. 

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR FINANCIAL YEAR  Risk and Opportunity Report 
ANNUAL REPORT 2007 -- adidas Group 
Of significant importance is our Group's Risk Management
Manual,  which is available to all Group employees online.  The
manual outlines the principles,  processes,  tools,  risk areas
and key responsibilities within our Group.  It also defines
reporting requirements and communication timelines.  Our
Group supplements this top-down,  bottom-up approach to
risk and opportunity management by employing our Global
Internal Audit department to independently assess and appraise operational and internal controls throughout the Group. 
The main components of our risk and opportunity management process are:


Risk and opportunity identification: The adidas Group continuously monitors the macroeconomic environment,  developments in the sporting goods industry,  as well as internal
processes to identify risks and opportunities as early as possible.  Local and regional business units have primary responsibility for the identification and management of risk and
opportunities.  Central risk management has defined a catalog
of potential risks and opportunities for our Group to assist in
the identification process.  In addition to the potential financial
impacts from changes in the overall macroeconomic,  political
and social landscape,  each business unit actively monitors
brand,  distribution channel and price point developments in
our core sport,  leisure lifestyle and sport fusion markets.  A
key element of the identification process is primary qualitative
and quantitative research such as trend scouting,  consumer
surveys and feedback from our business partners and controlled space network.  These efforts are supported by global
market research and competitor analysis.  Here,  secondary
material such as NPD Sports Tracking Europe or SportsScanInfo market research data is analyzed and global relationships
with independent trend and media agencies such as QRCICON Added Value and Trendwatching, com are maintained. 
Through this process we seek to identify the markets,  categories,  consumer target groups and product styles which show
most potential for future growth at a local,  regional and global
level.  Equally,  our analysis focuses on those areas that are at
risk of saturation,  increased competition or changing consumer tastes. 


Risk and opportunity assessment: Identified risks and opportunities are assessed with respect to (1) occurrence probabilityand (2) the potential contribution loss or profit,  with contribution being defined as operating profit before intra-Group
royalties.  The occurrence probability of individual risks and
opportunities is evaluated on a scale of 0 to 100 % likelihood. 
In this report,  we summarize these findings by utilizing 'high"'medium" or 'low" classifications to represent an aggregate
likelihood for various risk and opportunity categories.  As risks
and opportunities have different characteristics,  we have
defined separate methodologies for assessing the potential
financial impact.  With respect to risks,  the extent of potential
loss is measured on a case-by-case basis as the contribution
deviation from the most recent forecast under the assumption
that the risk fully materializes.  This calculation also reflects
the effects from risk-compensating measures.  In assessing
the potential contribution from opportunities,  each opportunity
is appraised with respect to viability,  commerciality,  potential
risks and the expected profit contribution.  This approach is
applied to both longer-term strategic prospects but also
shorter-term tactical and opportunistic initiatives at both the
Group and,  more extensively,  the brand level. 


Risk and opportunity treatment: Risks and opportunities are
treated in accordance with the Group's risk and opportunity
management principles and the Risk Management Manual. 
Line management in cooperation with central risk management and,  in exceptional cases,  the Executive Board and / or
Supervisory Board,  decides which individual risks we accept
or avoid and those opportunities to pursue or forgo.  As part of
this process,  we also decide on which risk-compensating or
transfer measures will be implemented.  Similarly,  to maximize
opportunities,  it may be necessary to reduce or limit distribution to protect prices and margins or prolong product lifecycles.  In some cases,  we also seek to transfer the responsibility or execution for certain risks and opportunities to third
parties (e.  g.  insurance,  outsourcing,  distribution agreements
or brand sub-licensing). 


Risk and opportunity monitoring and controlling: A primary
objective of our integrated risk and opportunity management
system is to increase the transparency of Group risks and
opportunities.  In addition,  we also seek to measure the success of our risk-compensating initiatives.  The Group centrally
monitors each of these efforts on a frequent basis.  In particular,  central risk management regularly examines the results
of actions taken by operational management to accept,  avoidreduce or transfer risks over time.  With respect to opportunities,  we regularly monitor the objectives and key performance
indicators established during the initial identification and
evaluation process.  This not only facilitates the validation of
opportunities but also allows us to adapt and refine our products,  communication and distribution strategy to ongoing
developments in our rapidly changing marketplace.  In particular,  we collaborate with our manufacturing partners and retail
customers to evaluate the impact of our growth and efficiency
initiatives.  Feedback is relayed in a timely manner to productmarketing and controlling functions. 

105


Risk and opportunity aggregation and reporting: Central risk
management aggregates Group-wide risks and reports them
to the Executive Board on a regular basis.  Individual risks are
aggregated based on the sum of all assessed risks (sum of
occurrence likelihood × potential net loss),  taking correlations
between individual risks into account.  Risks with a likely
impact of at least € 1 million on the forecasted full-year contribution are reported to central risk management on a monthly
basis.  In addition,  risks with a likely financial impact of € 5 million or more are required to be reported immediately upon
identification to central risk management.  Opportunities are
aggregated separately as part of the strategic business planning,  budgeting and forecasting processes.  The realization of
risks and opportunities can have a critical impact on our ability
to achieve our strategic objectives.  Therefore,  Management is
updated in regular business reviews,  but also through ad hoc
discussions as appropriate.

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR FINANCIAL YEAR  Risk and Opportunity Report 
MACROECONOMIC RISKS Growth of the sporting goods industry is influenced by consumer confidence and consumer
spending.  Abrupt economic downturns,  in particular in regions
where the Group is highly represented,  therefore pose a significant short-term risk to sales development.  To mitigate this
risk,  the Group strives to balance sales across key global
regions and also between developed and emerging markets. 
In addition,  a core element of our performance positioning is
the utilization of an extensive global event and partnership
portfolio where demand is more predictable and less sensitive
to macroeconomic influence. 
In 2008,  the Group expects global and,  in particular,  North
American economic growth to slow.  see Outlook,  p.  118 Similarlythe risk of macroeconomic shocks has increased versus 2007. 
However,  economic expansion in emerging markets,  including
China,  Russia and India,  is expected to continue.  These markets have overtaken North America and the European Union
as the largest contributors to Group revenue growth.  Nevertheless,  we now assess the likelihood that adverse macroeconomic events could impact our business as medium.  The
materialization of such events could have a medium negative
financial impact on our Group. 
CONSUMER DEMAND RISKS Failure to anticipate and respond
to changes in consumer demand is one of the most serious
threats to our industry.  Consumer demand changes can be
sudden and unexpected.  Because industry product procurement cycles average 12 to 18 months,  the Group faces a risk of
short-term revenue loss in cases where it is unable to respond
quickly to such changes.  Even more critical,  however,  is the
risk of continuously overlooking a new consumer trend or
failing to acknowledge its potential magnitude over a sustained
period of time. 

To mitigate this risk,  continually identifying and responding to
consumer demand shifts as early as possible is a key responsibility of our brands.  In this respect,  we utilize extensive
primary and secondary research tools as outlined in our risk
and opportunity identification process. 
As a leader in our industry,  our core brand strategies continue
to be focused on influencing rather than reacting to the changing consumer environment.  We invest significant resources
in research and development to innovate and bring fresh new
technologies and designs to market.  see Research and Developmentp.  072 In addition,  we also seek to create consumer demand for
our brands and brand initiatives through extensive marketingproduct and brand communication programs.  And,  we continue to focus on supply chain improvements to speed up
concept-to-shelf timelines.  see Global Operations,  p.  062 In 2007we implemented new consumer segmentation strategies at
both brand adidas and Reebok and combined Group resources
for market research and competitor research.  In addition,  we
increased and focused our marketing working budget spend
at Reebok,  in line with the future positioning of the brand.  We
plan further initiatives in this respect in 2008. 
Given the broad spectrum of our Group's product offeringretailer feedback,  visibility provided through our order backlogs and other early indicators,  see Internal Group Management Systemp.  056 we view the overall risk from consumer demand shifts
as unchanged versus the prior year.  Changes in consumer
demand continue to have a medium likelihood of occurrence
and could have a potential medium impact on our Group. 

ANNUAL REPORT 2007 -- adidas Group 
INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION RISKS The adidas Group is
exposed to risks from market consolidation and strategic
alliances amongst competitors and/or retailers.  This can result
in a reduction of our bargaining power,  or harmful competitive
behavior such as price wars.  Abnormal product discounting
and reduced shelf space availability from retailers is the most
common outcome of these risks.  Sustained promotional pressure in one of the Group's key markets could threaten the
Group's sales and profitability development. 

POLITICAL AND REGULATORY RISKS Political and regulatory
risk includes potential losses from expropriation,  nationalization,  civil unrest,  terrorism and significant changes to trade
policies.  In particular,  the adidas Group faces risks arising
from sudden increases of import restrictions,  import tariffs
and duties that could compromise the free flow of goods within
the Group and from suppliers.  To limit these risks,  we utilize
 regionally diversified supplier base which allows us to shift
production to other countries at an early stage if necessary. 
see Global Operations,  p.  062

To moderate this risk,  we are committed to maintaining a
regionally balanced sales mix and continually adapting the
Group's distribution strategy.  In 2007,  we employed this
strategy by instigating a new adidas distribution policy in the
UK.  In this market,  several years of retail consolidation had
led to inadequate product presentation among retailers.  As a
result,  we now offer our top product range to retailers who
satisfy more stringent trade policy requirements concerningfor example,  the display of product and training of staff. 
Although this strategy had a short-term negative impact on
sales,  it significantly improved the brand's attractiveness
to consumers at point-of-sale and led to a strong sales
improvement in the fourth quarter of 2007. 
Despite a more challenging merger and acquisition environment due to credit market difficulties,  we continue to expect
further consolidation activity among our competitors and retail
partners.  This is a result of the strong balance sheets and solid
free cash flows within our industry.  Therefore,  we continue to
see risks from market consolidation as having a medium likelihood and a medium potential impact on both Group sales and
profitability. 

In 2008,  we do not foresee major changes to current trade
policies that would have a major adverse effect on our Group. 
The Memorandum of Understanding between the EU and China
which enforced quotas on certain apparel categories expired
at the end of 2007.  We regard the likelihood of a reintroduction
of quotas as low because both parties have agreed on other
control mechanisms to manage export growth into the EU. 
The current apparel quota system between the USA and China
remains in place throughout 2008.  In October 2008,  the
European Commission will review its anti-dumping measures
on leather shoes imported from countries excluding China
and Vietnam.  However,  we anticipate exceptions for technical
athletic footwear,  which represents the majority of our footwear product offering,  to be maintained with only minor adaptations.  Nonetheless,  due to the proactive regional diversification of our sourcing portfolio,  any unforeseen changes in
the new EU legislation would likely have a very minor financial
effect on our Group.  Similarly,  we continue to regard the
medium-term risk of further political and regulatory actions
as having a low probability of occurrence.  However,  an
unexpected significant change in the political or regulatory
environment could have a medium potential financial impact. 

LEGAL RISKS The adidas Group is exposed to the risk of claims
and litigation for infringement of third party trademark,  patent
and other rights.  To reduce this risk,  new product technologiesdesigns and names are carefully researched to identify and
avoid potential conflicts with the rights of third parties.  In
February 2006,  a major competitor sued the adidas Group for
an alleged infringement of patent rights regarding a range of
footwear models.  This litigation was settled amicably in 2007. 
Also in 2007,  several suppliers and retailers in the athletic
footwear industry,  including the adidas Group,  were sued for
infringement of two patents relating to footwear designs.  The
adidas Group is vigorously contesting the claims in this litigation.  We have also strengthened our Intellectual Property
department resources to drive further enhancements in our
patent portfolio,  and in the reviewing and analysis of third party
patents. 

107

Due to the safeguards in place,  we believe there is a low likelihood of our Group infringing third party trademark or patent
rights in a material way.  Nevertheless,  we continue to believe
that litigation could have a medium financial impact on our
Group. 
RISKS FROM PRODUCT COUNTERFEITING As popular consumer brands which rely on technological and design innovation as defining characteristics,  the Group's brands are a
frequent target for counterfeiting and imitation.  Over seven
million counterfeit adidas Group products were seized worldwide in 2007 (2006: more than six million).  To reduce the loss
of sales and the potential reputation damage resulting from
counterfeit products sold under our brand names,  the adidas
Group makes use of extensive legal protection (generally
through registration) and works closely with law enforcement
authorities,  investigators and outside counsel.  Although we
have stepped up measures such as product security labeling
with our authorized suppliers,  continued development of these
measures remains a high priority for 2008 and beyond. 
We regard the likelihood of sustained counterfeiting as high in
the short and medium term.  However,  we believe we have
adequate costs budgeted to support our ongoing efforts to
successfully combat counterfeiting.  We continue to assess the
potential risk of counterfeiting to negatively impact our forecasted financial contribution as low. 

ANNUAL REPORT 2007 -- adidas Group

SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS We have a continuing
responsibility to our workers,  suppliers and the environment. 
Malpractice in these areas,  in particular human rights violations and dubious employment practices,  can have a significant
impact on the reputation and operational efficiency of our
Group and our suppliers.  To limit this risk,  we have established
workplace standards to which suppliers must conform before
and during business relationships with the Group
see Sustainability,  p.  065 Internal inspections of supplier factories verified
by extensive independent audits are conducted regularly.  In the
event of non-compliance with these standards,  we develop
joint action plans and set deadlines for compliance and further
improvement.  When these deadlines are not met,  business
relations are terminated.  see Sustainability,  p.  065,  and www, adidas
Group, com / sustainability 
We expect to further strengthen our supplier monitoring program in 2008.  As a result,  we continue to regard the risk of
social and environmental malpractice as likely in only isolated
cases and we believe the potential financial impact is low. 
NATURAL RISKS The adidas Group is exposed to external risks
such as natural disasters,  epidemics,  fire and accidents.  Further,  physical damage to our own or our suppliers' premisesproduction units,  warehouses and stock in transit can lead to
property damage and business interruption.  These risks are
mitigated by ample loss prevention measures such as working
with reliable suppliers and logistics providers who guarantee
high safety standards and disaster recovery plans.  In addition
to the considerable insurance coverage we have secured,  the
Group has also implemented contingency plans to minimize
potential negative effects. 
Our overall assessment of this risk is unchanged versus the
prior year.  As a result,  we believe the likelihood of natural risks
is low and expect only minor financial loss after insurance
compensation should natural risks materialize. 

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR FINANCIAL YEAR  Risk and Opportunity Report 
STRATEGIC AND OPERATIONAL RISKS
PORTFOLIO INTEGRATION RISKS The adidas Group is exposed
to risks related to the integration of newly acquired businesses. 
In our ongoing initiatives to integrate the Reebok brand,  we
face a risk of overestimating potential revenue and cost synergies as well as organizational execution risks.  Organizational
execution risks relate,  for example,  to the standardization of
functional business processes across the different brands and
harmonization of the Group's IT systems.  To mitigate these
risks,  we implemented a dedicated controlling function in 2006
to continuously oversee our integration activities. 
The realization of the projected revenue and cost synergies in
2007,  as well as internal transparency on 2008 initiatives,  supports our confidence in achieving our medium-term synergy
targets.  see Outlook,  p.  118 We therefore believe there continues
to be a low likelihood of portfolio integration risk occurrence. 
Due to the magnitude of projected synergies,  however,  we still
regard the potential financial impact of these risks as high. 
RISKS FROM LOSS OF BRAND IMAGE Maintaining and
enhancing brand image and reputation through the creation
of strong brand identities is crucial for sustaining and driving
revenue and profit growth.  It is also an important credential
as we extend our brands into new categories and regions. 
The adidas Group faces considerable risk if we are unable to
uphold high levels of consumer awareness,  affiliation and purchase intent for our brands.  To mitigate this risk,  we have defined clear mission statements,  values and goals for all our
brands.  These form the foundation of our product and brand
communication strategies.  We also continually refine our product offering to meet shifts in consumer demand and to contemporize our offering to respond to current trends.  Central to
all our brand image initiatives is ensuring clear and consistent
messaging to our targeted consumer audience,  in particular
at point-of-sale.  Strong brand momentum at adidas and
TaylorMade-adidas Golf,  as evidenced in improving market
research results,  gives us confidence that brand image risk
in both these segments remains low. 

During the past twelve months,  we introduced our first postacquisition initiatives to support our long-term brand image
strategy for Reebok.  In 2008,  we will increase our efforts by
launching several new product technologies and a new global
brand campaign to improve the overall consumer experience
for the Reebok brand.  see Reebok Strategy,  p.  050 Nevertheless,  due
to the current weakness of the brand in North America and the
UK,  and the possibility that our revitalization initiatives fail to
improve brand image in the short term,  we view the likelihood
of a further reduction in brand image as medium.  This could
potentially have a high financial impact on the sales and profitability of the Reebok segment. 
Aggregating these risks,  we continue to believe that brand
image risk for the Group has a medium likelihood of occurrence and also a medium potential financial impact on our
Group. 
OWN-RETAIL RISKS New adidas,  Reebok and Rockport ownretail stores require considerable up-front investment in furniture and fittings as well as ongoing maintenance.  In additionown-retail activities often require longer-term lease or rent
commitments.  Own retail also employs significantly more
personnel in relation to net sales than our wholesale business. 
The higher portion of fixed costs compared to our wholesale
business implies a larger profitability impact in cases of significant sales declines.  The Group minimizes this risk by only
entering into lease contracts with a duration of less than ten
years.  Store performance is measured by a retail scorecard
consisting of nine quantitative key performance indicators.  All
shops are ranked by their weighted average score.  Underperforming stores are restructured or closed as appropriate. 
We continue to believe the likelihood of major closures is
medium.  However,  due to the strong growth of own-retail
activities and a rapidly consolidating retail environment,  we
assess the potential financial impact from these closureswhich may also involve impairment charges,  as medium. 

ANNUAL REPORT 2007 -- adidas Group 
RISKS FROM RISING INPUT COSTS Raw material and labor
costs account for approximately 70 % of the Group's cost of
sales.  Prices of materials such as rubber,  which closely
correlate with the oil price,  are especially subject to the risk of
price increases.  As our ordering process and price negotiations
usually take place around six months in advance of productionour sourcing function has visibility and reaction time to manage and plan for sharp increases in input costs. 
To reduce the financial impact on our product margins from
higher sourcing costs,  we collaborate closely with our vendors
to increase efficiency in manufacturing processes and search
for new materials.  In addition,  we have exploited economies
of scale from our higher sourcing volume following the Reebok
acquisition and are constantly improving production efficiency. 
see Global Operations,  p.  062 We may also compensate for this risk
by increasing the selling prices of our products although this
is subject to the prevailing consumer and retail climate.  In
addition,  in the medium term we have the ability to adapt our
sourcing structure to take advantage of more competitive
pricing in other locations. 
We continue to assess the risks from rising input costs as
having a medium likelihood.  As a result of the time lag
between ordering and production,  we believe the short-term
financial impacts from input cost increases are low.  Howeverwith the sharp oil price increases during 2007,  ongoing wage
inflation in Asia and increasing freight costs,  we believe the
potential financial impact from rising input costs has grown for
the medium term.  This could have a medium financial impact
on our profitability beyond 2008. 

SUPPLIER DEFAULT RISKS Over 95 % of our product offering is
sourced through independent suppliers mainly located in Asia. 
see Global Operations,  p.  062 To reduce the risk of business interruptions following a potential supplier default,  we work with vendors who demonstrate reliability,  quality,  innovation and
continuous improvement.  In addition,  we have bought insurance coverage for the risk of business interruptions caused
by physical damage to supplier premises.  The Group has
also significantly reduced the number of independent manufacturers by combining the adidas and Reebok sourcing
organizations.  This exercise has allowed us to reduce risk
by simplifying our sourcing structure,  and focusing on the
highest-quality suppliers,  without compromising our flexibility
or competitiveness. 
We continue to assess supplier risks as having a low likelihood
of occurrence and potential financial impact. 
PRODUCT QUALITY RISKS The adidas Group faces a risk of
selling defective product,  which may result in injury to consumers and / or image impairment.  We mitigate this risk
through rigorous testing prior to production,  close cooperation
with suppliers throughout the manufacturing process,  random
testing after retail delivery,  open communication about defective products and quick settlement of product liability claims
when necessary.  In 2007,  approximately 3400 FSMK hockey
masks which were delivered to retail in Canada,  Europe and
the USA,  were subsequently recalled voluntarily due to a
quality issue.  The issue arose during subsequent random
testing of products after market launch.  During these random
tests,  a hockey puck was aimed at full speed directly at the
face masks.  Many of the masks dented and the coating
chipped slightly.  No incidents or injuries were reported before
or after the recall. 
Our assessment of product quality risk remains unchanged
versus the prior year.  We regard the likelihood of significant
product liability cases or having to conduct wide-scale product
recalls as low.  As we have insurance protecting us against the
financial consequences of significant product liability caseswe also assess the financial impact as low. 

CUSTOMER RISKS Customer risks arise from our dependence
on key customers who have the ability to exert bargaining
power and can therefore cause considerable margin pressure
or cancel orders.  These risks exist not only due to the relative
size of some of our major customers,  but also as a result of
our limited ability to impact how they conduct business and
the external impacts of the consumer environment in which
they operate. 

109

To limit these risks,  we utilize a broad distribution strategy
which includes our expanding controlled space activities.  This
enables us to reduce negative consequences that result from
sales shortfalls that can occur with key customers.  Specifically,  no customer at brands adidas,  Reebok and TaylorMadeadidas Golf accounted for more than 10 % of brand sales in
2007.  In addition,  we are proactively cooperating with key retail
partners to further optimize sales through innovative pointof-sale initiatives (e.  g.  our shop-in-shop concepts at Dick's
Sporting Goods). 
When necessary,  we also restrict the distribution of our brands
to protect brand image or product margins,  and to streamline
supply.  For example,  in the course of 2007,  the Group decided
to limit the Reebok product offering to an important mallbased key account in North America who had continually discounted Reebok product.  Although we have been strengthening
Reebok's business in other retail channels such as sporting
goods,  we expect this development will have a significant negative impact on Reebok segment sales in North America
throughout 2008.  Nevertheless,  the Group projects only a low
impact on the Group's overall contribution in 2008 from this
action. 
Due to the current difficulties at mall-based retailers and the
overall economic environment in the USA,  we continue to view
 strong reduction of business with one of our brands' biggest
retailers as having a medium likelihood of occurrence.  Such
an event could have a medium financial impact on the sales
and profitability of a particular region.  However,  on a Group
level,  we continue to view the financial impact from customer
risks as low. 

ANNUAL REPORT 2007 -- adidas Group

RISKS FROM LOSS OF KEY EVENT OR PROMOTION PARTNERSHIPS Event and promotion partnerships play an important
role in building brand image and generating sales of licensed
product.  The adidas Group faces the risk of either losing key
partnerships or having to accept unfavorable terms due to
intensified competition for attractive contracts.  To mitigate
these inherent risks,  we regularly seek to extend our most
important partnership agreements before contract expiry.  We
also regularly include change-of-control clauses as well as
non-cash compensation components in contracts to avoid the
risk that negotiations are reduced solely to price.  In additionwe follow a strategy of broadening the Group's portfolio of
premium partnerships in order to reduce our reliance on
single affiliations. 
During 2007,  we successfully secured long-term contract
extensions with a variety of important partners and announced
several important new event and multi-year promotion partnership agreements.  see adidas Strategy,  p.  046 In 2007,  competition
for top partnership assets within our industry increased notably.  An example of this was an attempt from a major competitor
to sign the German Football Federation (DFB).  Although we
successfully extended our contract with the DFB,  we now
believe there is a medium likelihood of losing important individual promotion contracts.  Nevertheless,  given the maturity of
our most important contracts,  we assess the potential financial
impact of this risk to be low in the medium term. 

PRODUCT DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT RISKS Innovative and
attractive products generate strong sales and more importantly create a halo effect for other products.  The speed with
which new product technologies and fresh designs are brought
to market is decisive for maintaining competitive advantage. 
In 2007,  all brands generated the majority of their sales with
products which had been brought to market over the last 12 to
18 months.  see Research and Development,  p.  072 If the adidas Group
failed to maintain a strong pipeline of new innovative products
over a sustained period of time,  we would risk a significant
sales decline.  We continue to invest in increasing our innovational and design strength.  To ensure we can quickly adapt
to changing consumer preferences,  we focus on streamlining
research and development processes to speed up the time
to market. 
We continue to assess the occurrence probability of this riskwhich could potentially have a significant financial impact,  as
low. 
PERSONNEL RISKS The adidas Group's future success is
highly dependent on our employees and their talents.  We thus
face the risk of being unable to identify,  recruit and retain the
most talented people that best meet the specific needs of our
Group.  To reduce this risk,  and enable our employees to make
use of their full potential,  we strongly engage in developing a
motivating working environment.  Our goal is to make the
adidas Group the 'Employer of Choice" within our industry. 
This is supplemented by offering attractive reward and incentive schemes as well as long-term career opportunities and
planning.  see Employees,  p.  068
In 2007,  we believe our personnel risks have increased moderately due to (1) growth of our own-retail activities where
employee turnover is higher than the Group average,  and
(2) growth in emerging markets where higher levels of wage
inflation increase the volatility of the employment market. 
Nevertheless,  we continue to regard the occurrence likelihood
of these risks as low.  Should these risks materialize,  they
could have a medium financial impact on our Group. 

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR FINANCIAL YEAR  Risk and Opportunity Report 
RISKS FROM NON-COMPLIANCE We face the risk that our
employees breach rules and standards that guide appropriate
and responsible business behavior.  In order to successfully
manage this risk,  the Group Policy Manual was launched at the
end of 2006 to provide the framework for basic work procedures
and processes.  It also includes a newly developed Code of
Conduct which stipulates that every employee shall act ethically
in compliance with the laws and regulations of the legal systems
where they conduct Group business.  In 2007,  the Group launched
 new Code of Conduct e-learning tool as part of our Global
Compliance Program to facilitate the ongoing training of our staff
in these matters.  see Corporate Governance Report,  p.  026 The global
roll-out of this tool will be completed in 2008.  Participation is
mandatory for all employees. 
We continue to regard the likelihood of grave misconduct as
low.  Should they materialize,  these risks could have a medium
financial impact on the Group. 
IT RISKS A Group-wide breakdown of IT systems or a significant loss of data could result in considerable disruptions to our
business.  Insufficient project management could delay the
execution of projects critical to the Group or make them more
expensive than planned.  To mitigate system default risk,  we
review our IT policy on a regular basis and engage in proactive
maintenance and business continuity planning.  We perform
scheduled backups several times a day and one full backup
daily,  alternating between two different data center locations. 
In addition,  for the central enterprise resource planning system,  our contingency solution allows us to quickly switch to a
remote site if necessary without any data loss.  System security and reliability are reviewed and tested internally and via
external audits on a regular basis.  Our target availability of
997 % for major IT applications was exceeded in 2007.  IT
project risks are further mitigated by implementing a proven
project methodology for all IT projects and by performing
regular risk reviews for all major projects. 
We believe the risk of a major IT default continues to be
extremely low.  Such a default,  however,  would result in a
significant potential financial impact. 

ANNUAL REPORT 2007 -- adidas Group 
FINANCIAL RISKS
CREDIT RISKS A credit risk arises if a customer or other
counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.  The adidas Group is exposed to credit risk
from its operating activities and from certain financing activities.  Credit risks arise principally from accounts receivable and
to a lesser extent from other contractual financial obligations
such as other financial assets,  short-term bank deposits and
derivative financial instruments.  see Note 23,  p.  180 Without
taking into account any collateral or other credit enhancements,  the carrying amount of financial assets represents the
maximum exposure to credit risk. 
At the end of 2007,  there was no relevant concentration of credit
risk by type of customer or geography.  Instead,  our credit risk
exposure is mainly influenced by individual customer characteristics.  Under the Group's credit policy,  new customers are
analyzed for creditworthiness before standard payment and
delivery terms and conditions are offered.  This review utilizes
external ratings from credit agencies.  Purchase limits are also
established for each customer.  Then both creditworthiness and
purchase limits are monitored on an ongoing basis.  Customers
that fail to meet the Group's minimum creditworthiness are
allowed to purchase products only on a pre-payment basis. 
Other activities to mitigate credit risks,  which are employed on
 selective basis only,  include credit insurances,  bank guarantees as well as retention of title clauses. 
The Group utilizes allowance accounts for impairments that
represent our estimate of incurred credit losses with respect
to accounts receivable.  The allowance consists of two components: (1) an allowance based on historical experience of
unexpected losses established for all receivables based on the
ageing structure of receivables past due date,  and (2) a specific
allowance that relates to individually assessed risk for each
specific customer irrespective of ageing.  Allowance accounts
are used to record impairment losses unless our Group is satisfied that no recovery of the amount owed is possible; at that
point the amount considered irrecoverable is written off
against the receivable directly. 

At the end of 2007,  no customer at either adidas,  Reebok or
TaylorMade-adidas Golf accounted for more than 10 % of
accounts receivable.  Allowance for doubtful accounts receivable remained at a similar level of total accounts receivable in
2007 compared to the prior year.  Our Days of Sales Outstanding
were unchanged compared to the prior year at 58 days.  As a
result,  we believe that our overall credit risk level from customers has remained nearly unchanged despite an increasingly
difficult retail environment in many key markets.  see Economic
and Sector Development,  p.  078 Therefore,  we continue to estimate the
likelihood and potential financial impact of credit risks from
customers as low. 
Credit risks from other financial contractual relationships include items such as other financial assets,  short-term bank
deposits and derivative financial instruments.  The adidas Group
Treasury department arranges currency and interest rate
hedges,  and invests cash,  with major banks of a high credit
standing throughout the world.  All banks are rated 'A–" or
higher in terms of Standard & Poor's long-term ratings (or a
comparable rating from other rating agencies).  Foreign-based
adidas Group companies are authorized to work with banks
rated 'BBB +" or higher.  Only in exceptional cases are subsidiaries authorized to work with banks rated lower than 'BBB +". 
To limit risk in these cases,  restrictions are clearly stipulated
such as maximum cash deposit levels.  As a result,  we estimate
the likelihood and potential financial impact of credit risks
from these assets as low.  We believe our risk concentration is
limited due to the broad distribution of our investment business
with a syndicate of approximately 30 banks.  In 2007,  no bank
accounted for more than 17 % of our investment business and
the average concentration is 1 %.  This leads to a maximum exposure of € 63 million in the event of default of any single
bank.

ANNUAL REPORT 2007 -- adidas Group 
112

FINANCING AND LIQUIDITY RISKS Liquidity risks arise from
not having the necessary resources available to meet maturing
liabilities with regard to timing,  volume and currency structure. 
In addition,  the adidas Group faces the risk of having to accept
unfavorable financing terms due to liquidity restraints.  Our
Group's Treasury department uses an efficient cash management system to manage liquidity risk.  At December 31,  2007Group cash and cash equivalents amounted to € 295 million
(2006: € 311 million).  Moreover,  our Group maintains credit
lines and long-term financing arrangements with leading
banks,  such as a € 2 billion international medium-term
syndicated loan facility and a € 2 billion Commercial Paper
Program,  in order to ensure sufficient liquidity at all times. 
see Treasury,  p.  091

Future cash outflows arising from financial liabilities that are
recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet are presented
within the adjacent table.  This includes payments to settle
obligations from borrowings as well as cash outflows from
cash-settled derivatives with negative market values.  Financial
liabilities that may be settled in advance without penalty are
included on the basis of the earliest date of potential repayment.  Cash flows for variable-interest liabilities are determined with reference to the conditions at the balance sheet
date. 
In 2007,  we reduced net debt by € 465 million.  see Treasury,  p.  091
As a result of this effort,  we have reduced our exposure to
financing and liquidity risks in 2007.  We view these risks as
having a low likelihood of occurrence.  Nevertheless,  failure to
maintain liquidity could have a high financial impact on Group
performance. 

CURRENCY RISKS Currency risks for the adidas Group are a
direct result of multi-currency cash flows within the Group. 
The biggest single driver behind this risk results from the mismatch of the currencies required for sourcing our products
versus the denominations of our sales.  The vast majority of our
sourcing expenses are in US dollars while sales are denominated in other currencies to a large extent most notably the
euro and the British pound.  Since Group companies in the UK
are invoiced in euro internally,  our main exposures are a US dollar
short and a British pound long exposure versus the euro. 
In line with IFRS 7 requirements,  we have estimated the impact
on net income and shareholders' equity based on changes in
our most important currency exchange rates.  The calculated
impacts mainly result from our hedging practice.  The analysis
does not include effects that arise from the translation of our
foreign entities' financial statements into the Group's reporting
currency.  The sensitivity analysis is based on the net balance
sheet exposure,  including inter-company balances from monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. 
Moreover,  all currency derivatives were re-evaluated using
hypothetical foreign exchange rates to determine the effects
on net income and equity.  The analysis was performed on the
same basis for both 2006 and 2007. 
Based on this analysis,  a 10 % increase in the euro versus
the US dollar at December 31,  2007,  would have led to a
€ 5 million increase in net income.  The negative market values
of the US dollar hedges would have decreased shareholders'
equity by € 111 million.  A 10 % weaker euro at December 312007 would have led to a € 6 million decrease in net income. 
Shareholders' equity would have increased by € 130 million. 
The impacts of fluctuations of the euro against the British
pound and other major currencies on net income and shareholders' equity are also included in accordance with IFRS
requirements.

However,  many other financial and operational variables that
could potentially reduce the effect from currency fluctuations
are excluded from the analysis.  These include:


Interest rates and all other exchange rates are assumed
constant. 
Exchange rates are assumed at a year-end value instead
of the more relevant sales-weighted average figure,  which we
utilize internally to better reflect both the seasonality of our
business and intra-year currency fluctuations. 


The underlying forecasted cash flow exposure (which the
hedge instrument mainly relates to) is not required to be
revalued in this analysis. 


Operational issues,  such as potential discounts to key
accounts who have high transparency regarding the impacts
of currency on our sourcing activities (due to their own private
label sourcing efforts),  are also excluded from this presentation. 
Utilizing a centralized currency risk management system,  our
Group hedges currency needs for projected sourcing requirements on a rolling 12- to 18-month basis.  see Treasury,  p.  091 Our
goal is to have the vast majority of our hedging volume secured
six months prior to the start of a given season.  In rare instanceslong-term promotion partnership contracts are hedged beyond
the 18-month horizon.  The Group also largely hedges balance
sheet risks.  Due to our strong global position,  we are able to
minimize currency risk to a large extent by utilizing natural
hedges.  Nevertheless,  our net US dollar exposure calculated
for the full current hedging period was roughly € 24 billion at
year-end 2007,  which we hedged using forward contractscurrency options and currency swaps.  Our Group's Treasury
Policy allows us to utilize hedging instruments,  such as
currency options or option combinations,  which provide
protection while at the same time retain the potential
to benefit from future favorable exchange rate developments
in the financial markets. 

The Group increased the proportion of its longer-term hedges
in 2007,  to strategically utilize the strong euro versus nearly
all other major currencies.  We also employed a higher rate
of forward contracts to reduce option premiums.  see Note 23p.  180 As 2008 hedging has almost been completed,  it is clear
that exchange rates will be more favorable than those of 2007. 
Correspondingly,  we believe that both the level and likelihood of
currency risk to our 2008 financial contribution has declined
versus the prior year and is low overall. 
INTEREST RATE RISKS Changes in market interest rates affect
future interest payments for variable-interest liabilities.  As a
result,  significant interest rate increases can have an adverse
effect on the Group's profitability,  liquidity and financial position. 
The acquisition of Reebok in 2006 led to an increase in interest
rate risks due to the higher financing requirements and the
resulting higher weighted-average interest rate on the Group's
financing structure.  see Treasury,  p.  091
In line with IFRS 7 requirements,  we have analyzed the impact
of changes in the Group's most important interest rates on net
income and shareholders' equity.  The effect of interest rate
changes on future cash flows is excluded from this analysis. 
Nevertheless,  accrued interest,  which is recognized as a liabilityhas been re-calculated based on the hypothetical market
interest rates as at December 31,  2007.  Fair values for derivative interest rate instruments accounted for as cash flow
hedges were then re-evaluated based on the hypothetical
market interest rates with the resulting effects on net income
and equity included in the sensitivity analysis.  The fair value
interest rate risk from private placements that are hedged with
fair value hedges was also taken into consideration.  Howeverthe effect on the income statement from changes in the fair
values of hedged items and hedging instruments attributable
to interest rate changes was not material.  Exclusions from this
analysis are as follows:

The interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift of
the interest yield curve for all currencies and was performed
on the same basis for both 2006 and 2007.  A 100 basis point
increase in interest rates at December 31,  2007 would have
increased shareholders' equity by € 6 million (2006: € 5 million)
and decreased net income by € 2 million (2006: € 2 million). 
 100 basis point decrease of the interest rates at December 312007 would have resulted in a € 7 million decrease in shareholders' equity (2006: € 8 million) and a € 2 million increase in
net income (2006: € 2 million). 

113

We believe the IFRS 7 interest rate analysis represents a
realistic if rough estimate of our current interest rate risk. 
To moderate interest rate risks and maintain financial flexibilitya core tenet of our Group's financial strategy is to reduce financial
leverage (i.  e.  net debt / shareholders' equity) to under 50 %.  In
2007,  we strongly reduced net debt associated with the financing
of the Reebok acquisition.  see Treasury,  p.  091 Capitalizing on low
interest rates at the time of the acquisition,  we also strongly
increased the share of fixed-rate financing arrangements in
early 2006.  In 2007,  we prioritized our debt reduction activities
on variable interest instruments.  As a result,  fixed-rate financing arrangements accounted for 70 % of our total debt outstanding at December 31,  2007,  compared to 65 % in the prior
year.  see Treasury,  p.  091
Due to these and various other risk compensation measureswe believe we have made considerable progress on reducing
interest rate risks in 2007.  Taking the current macroeconomic
situation into account,  we do not anticipate a significant change
in our Group's average interest rate in 2008.  Therefore,  we continue to project the likelihood of significant Group interest rate
increases,  which could have a low financial effect on our contribution,  as low. 


Some fixed-rate financial assets,  such as commercial paper
and certificates of deposit,  which our Group values at 'fair
value through profit or loss" due to the short-term maturity of
these instruments.  Potential effects due to changes in interest
rates are considered immaterial and are not recognized in the
sensitivity analysis. 


Other fixed-rate financial instruments are measured at
amortized cost.  Since a change in interest rates would not change
the carrying amount of this category of instruments,  there is
no net income impact and they are excluded from this analysis.

EXTERNAL AND INDUSTRY OPPORTUNITIES
FAVORABLE MACROECONOMIC AND FISCAL POLICY
CHANGES As a consumer goods company,  consumer confidence and spending can impact our sales development. 
Therefore,  better than initially forecasted macroeconomic
developments and fiscal policy changes which support private
consumption can have a positive impact on our sales and profitability.  In addition,  legislative changes,  e.  g.  with regard to
the taxation of corporate profits,  can positively impact Group
profitability. 
SPORTS PARTICIPATION ON THE RISE Governments increasingly promote living an active lifestyle to fight obesity and
cardiovascular disease.  According to the World Health
Organization,  around 400 million people were considered
obese in 2005.  Another 16 billion more were estimated to
be overweight.  These numbers are projected to increase to
700 million and 23 billion respectively by 2015.  Once considered a problem only in affluent nations,  obesity is also
becoming an issue in countries with low per capita income. 
This development has serious health consequences and a
dramatic effect on health care expenditures.  As a resultgovernments and non-governmental organizations are
increasing their efforts to promote a healthy lifestyle and
encourage sports participation.  Given our strong market
position,  in particular in categories considered suitable for
weight loss such as training,  running and swimming,  we
expect to benefit from this trend. 
INCREASING CONSUMER DEMAND FOR FUNCTIONAL
APPAREL Consumer demand for functional apparel has
increased significantly in recent years as consumers realize
the benefits of functional apparel over traditional cotton
sportswear.  Improved moisture management,  superior ease
of motion,  and increased comfort are all factors encouraging
consumers to switch to high-performance gear.  The design
and development of functional apparel requires significantly
more expertise,  product and material research as well as production know-how compared to low-tech apparel.  Thereforeonly a few companies are able to supply high-end functional
apparel.  Our resources and our positioning as a sports performance leader enable us to constantly develop innovative products and capitalize on them.  For example,  adidas is strongly
growing in compression apparel.  Due to our attractive
TECHFIT™ offering,  we achieved strong growth in this category
in 2007 and expect to double sales in 2008. 

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR FINANCIAL YEAR  Risk and Opportunity Report 
FAST-GROWING WOMEN'S SEGMENT The women's sports
market is one of the most attractive segments in the sporting
goods industry with women accounting for almost half of total
spending on athletic footwear.  In addition,  women also make
over 80 % of the purchase decisions for sports apparel for menwomen and children.  As our Group generates the majority of
its revenue in the men's segment,  the women's category offers
potential for further growth.  adidas,  Reebok and TaylorMadeadidas Golf each address the female consumer in their own
distinctive way.  With targeted product offerings in both performance and lifestyle,  such as the adilibria,  Fuse and Clima 365
collections at adidas,  the Avon Pink Ribbon collection at
Reebok and the Women's r7® CGB MAX at TaylorMade,  all of
our brands are well-positioned in the women's category.  Going
forward,  we will extend and broaden our women's offering –
emphasizing individuality,  authenticity and style. 
ONGOING FUSION OF SPORT AND LIFESTYLE The border
between pure athletics and lifestyle continues to blur as sport
becomes a more integral part in the lives of more and more
consumers.  People want to be fashionable when engaging in
sporting activities without compromising on quality or the
latest technological advances.  At the same time,  performance
features and styles are finding their way into products meant
for more leisure-oriented use.  As the global sports lifestyle
market is roughly three times larger than the performance
market,  this development opens up additional opportunities for
our Group and our brands which already enjoy strong positions in this market.  adidas has an authentic sports lifestyle
offering and the adidas Sport Style division is targeted to grow
overproportionately until at least 2010.  see adidas Strategy,  p.  046
Lifestyle products are also an important pillar in Reebok's
brand strategy.  We have augmented Reebok's Classics and
music-inspired business with new celebrity partnerships to
upgrade and emotionalize the brand's lifestyle offering.  In 2008
and beyond,  we will launch new initiatives in this category to
capitalize on Reebok's lifestyle credibility. 

ANNUAL REPORT 2007 -- adidas Group 
EMERGING MARKETS AS LONG-TERM GROWTH DRIVERS
Emerging economies in Asia,  Europe and Latin America have
consistently grown at stronger rates than more mature markets over the last several years.  However,  due to economic
constraints,  sports participation in most of these countries has
historically been lower than in industrialized countries.  Nowrising real incomes and employment rates as well as positive
demographic trends and a growing middle class are fueling
these economies and subsequently our industry.  This development is expected to continue for at least three to five years. 
European and North American sporting goods brands are often
seen as easily accessible,  affordable luxury goods.  Our Group
currently generates around 25 % of sales in emerging marketswhich reflects a higher exposure compared to many of our
competitors.  Further,  we believe we have excellent opportunities for further growth,  in particular in China and Russia.  Supported by our strong portfolio of partnerships,  e.  g.  the NBAYao Ming and the China Golf Association in China as well as
Andrij Shevchenko and the Russian Basketball Federation in
Russia,  our strong market positions and our extensive distribution network,  we aim to reach sales of € 1 billion in Chinawhile Russia is expected to become our biggest market in
terms of sales and profits in Europe by 2010. 
GROWING POPULARITY OF 'GREEN" PRODUCTS Today's
consumers are increasingly concerned about the impact their
consumption has on the environment.  Therefore,  they demand
more and more products that are environmentally benign.  For
many consumers,  materials used in footwear and apparel
are now expected to be suitable for re-use,  while still looking
fashionable and stylish.  By positioning ourselves in this field
within the sports lifestyle segment,  we can benefit from the
growing demand for environmentally friendly products.  In
2008,  we are launching the adidas Grün collection within our
adidas Sport Style division.  The collection consists of footwear
and apparel made of organic,  untreated or recycled materials
such as cork,  manila and linen.  We expect consumer demand
for environmentally friendly products to increase going forward. 

STRATEGIC AND OPERATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES
STRONG MARKET POSITIONS WORLDWIDE The adidas Group
has the highest market share in numerous countries around
the world.  This strong competitive position offers us many
advantages in terms of global brand visibility,  market power
and the ability to effectively expand our position in emerging
markets.  As a result of our strong partnership portfolio and
marketing efforts,  consumers around the globe are highly
aware of our brands and are receptive to our brand messaging. 
This makes demand for our products more stable compared to
smaller competitors.  Hence,  many retailers consider our
products as core to their offering.  The adidas Group is therefore in a strong bargaining position and can compete more
effectively for shelf space.  Our local market knowledge and
marketing power also enable us to quickly react to emerging
trends in niche categories such as skateboarding or even
enter completely new categories. 
MULTI-BRAND APPROACH We believe there is a natural limit
to the audience size a single brand can appeal to,  given the
diverse tastes and expectations of a highly-fragmented consumer market.  Our multi-brand approach provides us with
the opportunity to leverage the power of our brands in a more
precise and meaningful way.  see Group Strategy,  p.  044 We are able
to utilize the combined strengths of each brand to compete for
 higher percentage of the total market covering a greater
number of consumer needs,  price points and demographics. 

PERSONALIZATION AND CUSTOMIZATION REPLACING MASS
WEAR Today's consumers are looking for choice and variety
that goes beyond choosing from a wide selection of products. 
We engage in developing unique and relevant products that fit
specific functional and aesthetic requirements.  see Group Strategyp.  044 adidas,  Reebok and TaylorMade-adidas Golf all offer
different personalization and customization platforms
reflecting each brand's strategy.  Key concepts include the
adidas 'mi Innovation Center" and Reebok's 'Rbk Custom"
online platform.  Utilizing the newest body mapping technologyconsumers can personalize our most innovative and popular
footwear styles to their own fit and performance needs.  We
believe this technology leads the way in sporting goods retail
and have started to roll out 'mi Innovation Centers" throughout our concept stores in 2007.  'Rbk Custom" is a web-based
platform over which consumers can customize footwear.  Shoes
are then shipped within ten business days.  We expect the
market for personalized and customized footwear,  apparel and
hardware to grow strongly and evolve further in the coming
years. 
BREAKING NEW GROUND IN DISTRIBUTION The sporting goods
retail environment is changing constantly.  People increasingly
want to get involved with our brands.  We have adapted our
distribution to cater to this change and have made controlled
space initiatives a strategic priority.  We will start introducing
e-commerce in the Netherlands as a test market for Europe in
2008.  We also see opportunities to operate new shop formats
in cooperation with other brands.  In 2007,  we opened the 'NHL
Powered by Reebok" store in New York,  showcasing Reebok's
broad choice of hockey products.  Similarly,  adidas opened the
first European NBA Concept Shop in Istanbul,  Turkey.  Through
initiatives like these,  we can more effectively target consumers
and involve them emotionally with our products.  In our wholesale business,  we are increasing our flexibility to utilize
changes in consumption behavior as they arise.  In 2007,  for
example,  we actively strengthened our North American distribution in the growing sporting goods retail channel.  Here,  we
are able to showcase a much broader choice of our footwear –
and particularly apparel products compared to the athletic
specialty channel where industry sales decreased.

TAKING CONTROL OF DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS Our brands do
business in virtually all countries around the world.  The majority
of our business is done through fully-owned subsidiaries or
sales organizations.  see Group Strategy,  p.  044 Nevertheless,  in
some markets,  we work with distributors or joint venture
partners,  in particular at brand Reebok.  In doing so,  we capitalize on third party expertise in terms of how to best service
retailers in those countries.  While this strategy can be appropriate in a market's early development,  we strongly believe in
having full control over distribution and brand management
in more mature markets.  Therefore,  it is our Group's strategy
to buy back distribution rights for our brands when possible
and economically sensible.  Over the last several years,  we
have been very successful in this respect.  After having bought
back distribution rights for the adidas brand in Japan,  Italy and
Turkey,  we grew significantly in these markets.  At Reebok,  we
have identified the buyback of distribution rights as the single
most important revenue synergy potential.  see Outlook,  p.  118
In 2007,  we realized incremental sales in all countries where
Reebok bought back distribution rights.  Going forward,  we will
evaluate potential buyback opportunities on a case-by-case
basis,  considering opportunities as well as inherent risks from
litigation. 

COST OPTIMIZATION DRIVES PROFITABILITY IMPROVEMENTS
Continued optimization of key business processes and strict
cost control are vital to achieving high profitability and return
on invested capital.  As a result of the Reebok acquisition,  we
generate cost synergies that support adidas and Reebok profitability development.  see Outlook,  p.  118 Nonetheless,  our profit
margins continue to be below those of our main competitors. 
We do,  however,  see numerous levers for streamlining our
cost base going forward.  We can further simplify processes
across brands and functions to reduce operational inefficiencies owed to the increased complexity of our Group.  In
North America,  we believe we will be able to realize mediumterm economies of scale as we continue to integrate adidas
and Reebok back-office functions.  In addition,  we strive to
further increase efficiency in our supply chain and make it
truly demand-driven.  By implementing end-to-end planning
processes and improving our replenishment capabilities,  we
see opportunities to not only better serve our customers but
also to further reduce our operating working capital needs. 
see Global Operations,  p.  062

FINANCIAL OPPORTUNITIES
FAVORABLE FINANCIAL MARKET CHANGES Favorable
exchange and interest rate developments can potentially have
 positive impact on the Group's financial results.  Our Group
Treasury department closely monitors the financial markets to
identify opportunities. 

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR FINANCIAL YEAR  Risk and Opportunity Report  Subsequent Events 
MANAGEMENT ASSESSMENT OF OVERALL RISK AND OPPORTUNITIES
Central risk management aggregates all risks reported by
brand,  regional and headquarter functions.  Based on the compilation of risks taking into account the occurrence likelihood
and potential financial impact and the current business outlook
explained within this report adidas Group Management does
not foresee any individual or aggregate risks which could
materially jeopardize the ongoing business health and viability
of the Group.  In comparison to the prior year,  some External
and Industry Risks as well as some Strategic and Operational
Risks have increased.  All Financial Risks have decreased.  As
 result,  Management regards the overall risk likelihood as
having increased moderately versus 2007.  The potential financial impact from the Group's overall risk exposure is largely
unchanged,  due to increased risk-compensating and transfer
factors now in place. 
This assessment is also supported by the continued positive
responses to our financing demands.  see Treasury,  p.  091 The
adidas Group therefore has not sought an official rating by any
of the leading rating agencies. 
Management remains confident that the Group's earning
power forms a solid basis for our future business development and provides the necessary resource to pursue the
opportunities available to the Group. 

ANNUAL REPORT 2007 -- adidas Group 
SUBSEQUENT EVENTS Since the end of 2007there have been subsequent events which
will influence the future development of the
adidas Group.  In addition to the announcement
of a share buyback program,  other subsequent
events include the expansion of the Amsterdambased adidas International Trading B. V, adidas Canada's purchase of Saxon Athletic
as well as TaylorMade-adidas Golf's divestiture
of the Maxfli brand.  However,  there has been
no subsequent event since the end of 2007
which we expect to influence our business
materially going forward or that has changed
Management expectations for 2008. 

SUBSEQUENT CHANGES IN THE GROUP'S STRUCTURE
On February 5,  2008,  we announced the expansion of the
Amsterdam-based adidas International Trading B. V.  to create
 global,  multi-brand trading platform for the adidas Group. 
Primary responsibility will be to purchase product from our
suppliers and sell it to the adidas and Reebok sales organizations and distributors around the globe.  As a result,  we expect
to improve service levels to our sales organizations and
increase the speed with which our supply chain responds to
change.  Around 60 positions,  in particular in the Global Operations and Logistics sectors,  will be transferred from various
locations to Amsterdam.  Ultimately,  we expect this company to
employ more than 150 employees. 
SUBSEQUENT EVENTS AT ADIDAS Effective January 3,  2008adidas Canada acquired Saxon Athletic Manufacturing Inc. 
(based in Brantford / Ontario,  Canada) to strengthen adidas'
position in the teamwear business in North America.  Canadianbased Saxon Athletic is a design,  development,  marketing
and manufacturing company for team uniforms worn by professional and amateur teams throughout North America. 
Both Saxon Athletic sales and the transaction value in euros
represent an amount in the low-single-digit millions. 
SUBSEQUENT EVENTS AT TAYLORMADE-ADIDAS GOLF
Effective February 11,  2008,  TaylorMade-adidas Golf divested
the Maxfli brand,  which will allow the segment to increase
and improve the focus of its golf ball business under the
TaylorMade brand.  As the divested business accounted for
approximately 1 % of TaylorMade-adidas Golf sales in 2007this will have a minor negative impact on the segment's sales
development in 2008.  The transaction value in euros represents an amount in the low-double-digit millions. 

SUBSEQUENT SHARE COUNT CHANGES As a result of stock
options exercised as part of various tranches of the Management Share Option Plan (MSOP) for executives of of adidas AGthe number of outstanding shares increased by 16000 to
203644960 no-par value shares on January 15,  2008. 

117

On January 29,  2008,  adidas AG announced the launch of a
share buyback program.  Treasury shares of up to 5% of the
Company's stock capital (up to 10182248 shares) with an
aggregate value of up to € 420 million (excluding incidental
purchasing costs) shall be repurchased,  exclusively via the
stock exchange.  adidas AG intends to cancel the repurchased
shares,  thus reducing its stock capital.  As a result,  the Group's
equity ratio will decrease and earnings per share will
increase.  Further,  shares may also be used to meet obligations towards Group employees arising from share option
programs.  The share buyback will be financed exclusively
from the Group's free cash flow.  The buyback program started
on January 30,  2008,  and will be conducted in accordance with
the Commission Regulation (EC) No.  2273 / 2003 of December 22,  2003.  As at February 15,  2008,  adidas AG had bought
back 1180000 shares with an average purchase price of
€ 4268.  In line with the Commission Regulation (EC)
No.  2273 / 2003,  adidas AG provides regular updates on the
progress of the share buyback on its corporate website. 
www, adidas-Group, com/sharebuyback 
NO OTHER SUBSEQUENT CHANGES Since the end of 2007there have been no significant macroeconomic,  sociopoliticallegal or financing changes which we expect to influence our
business materially going forward.  In addition,  there have been
no major management changes since the end of 2007.

OUTLOOK 2008 is poised to be another strong
year for the adidas Group.  Based on our current product pipeline and planned marketing
initiatives,  we expect strong top- and bottomline results despite some negative macroeconomic signals in important markets such
as the USA.  This year's two global sporting
events,  the UEFA EURO 2008™ and the Beijing
2008 Olympic Games,  are expected to support
development of the adidas segment in 2008. 
Further progress on the Reebok revitalization
process will be another area of particular focus. 
Compared to the prior year,  Group revenue
and cost synergies resulting from the Reebok
integration will increase.  Consequently,  we
expect to grow currency-neutral sales at
 high-single-digit rate for the adidas Groupdriven by growth at all our brands.  In additionwe project increases in both our gross and
operating margins,  which will be between
475 and 48 % and at least 95 %,  respectively. 
Further,  we forecast net income attributable
to shareholders to grow by at least 15 %. 

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR FINANCIAL YEAR  Outlook 
MAJOR SPORTING EVENTS TO IMPACT 2008 RESULTS Our
Group's operating activities will be positively influenced by this
year's major sporting events: the UEFA EURO 2008™ and the
Beijing 2008 Olympic Games. 
As Official Sponsor of the UEFA EURO 2008™,  adidas will
benefit from this event in terms of positive brand visibility but
also in terms of additional sales of adidas football products. 
As a result,  we forecast brand adidas sales in the important
football category to increase strongly to a new record level
of over € 12 billion in 2008.  The operating margin of the adidas
brand,  however,  is not expected to be positively impacted
by this event as the related top-line growth is projected to be
offset by a modest marketing working budget increase. 
The Olympic Games will be the most important sports event
ever in China,  one of the fastest-growing markets for sporting
goods in the world.  adidas is the Official Sportswear Partner
for the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games and the outfitter of
16 National Olympic Committees.  As a result,  adidas will be
the most visible brand during this event,  outfitting all technical
officials and more than 100000 volunteers.  Further,  we anticipate a positive impact on brand Reebok.  In China,  Reebok will
benefit from the partnership with Yao Ming,  China's most
prominent athlete.  As a result,  we expect our involvement in
the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games to have a positive long-term
impact on the image and sales development of both adidas
and Reebok.  Supported by this event,  we expect the adidas
Group to become the market leader in China in 2008.  Howeverwe expect no significant sales increase related to the Olympic
Games in 2008,  as we have only limited opportunities to commercialize products for highly specialized Olympic disciplines. 
Additionally,  event-related marketing costs will lead to a minor
marketing working budget increase at both brands. 

INCREASING REVENUE AND COST SYNERGIES IN 2008
We have ambitious revenue and cost synergy targets related to
the Reebok integration in 2008.  adidas Group revenue synergies will grow to around € 250 million in 2008 (2007: around
€ 100 million) and are expected to positively impact the sales
development of both the adidas and Reebok segments.  The
majority of revenue synergies will be related to accelerating
sales growth in Europe's emerging markets and Asia where
Reebok has bought out distributor and joint venture partners. 
We also expect adidas to continue to benefit from increasing
revenue synergies.  These relate to the further expansion
of adidas' exclusive relationship with the NBA particularly
in Asia as well as to the utilization of the Sports Licensed
division for other licensed products in North America such
as college sports.  One-time costs associated with achieving
these synergies are estimated to be between € 15 million and
€ 25 million in 2008 (2007: around € 25 million). 
We expect cost synergies related to the Reebok integration
to be around € 175 million in 2008 (2007: around € 90 million). 
This increase will positively impact both cost of sales and
operating expense development.  We will continue to achieve
cost of sales synergies through supply chain optimization. 
Cost synergies within the Group's operating expenses will be
realized through various initiatives such as joint media buyingoffice consolidation in Europe and Asia,  harmonizing and
consolidating our IT systems,  eliminating duplicative corporate
functions as well as sharing finance and administrative services across the Group.  One-time costs associated with
achieving these cost synergy targets are expected to remain
on a level of around € 70 million in 2008 (2007: around € 70 million).  As a result,  net cost synergies are expected to rise to
around € 105 million in 2008 (2007: around € 20 million). 

ANNUAL REPORT 2007 -- adidas Group 
EXPIRATION OF AMER SOURCING AGREEMENT TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT HQ / CONSOLIDATION SALES Sales recorded
in the HQ / Consolidation segment will decrease during 2008as a result of the expiration of the Group's cooperation agreement with Amer Sports Corporation in the first quarter.  Under
this agreement,  the adidas Group sourced product for Salomon
at a fixed buying commission for a limited period in an effort
to support the transfer of Salomon's business activities to
Amer Sports Corporation.  However,  as this agreement includes
margins below the Group's average,  the expiration of this
contract is expected to have a positive impact on the Group's
gross and operating margins.  However,  this impact will be
limited due to the small size of the business contained in the
cooperation agreement. 
SLOWDOWN IN GLOBAL ECONOMIC EXPANSION PROJECTED
IN 2008 According to the World Bank,  growth of the global
economy is expected to decline in 2008 with a projected GDP
growth rate of around 3 %.  Recent turbulence in financial
markets triggered by the US subprime crisis and its spillover
effects are seen as the main catalyst. 
In Europe,  GDP in the Euro Zone is expected to grow at a level
of below 2 % in 2008.  Financial market uncertainties,  lower
exports and a further strengthening of the euro are all expected
to hamper growth in the region.  Consumer confidence is forecasted to continue to decline mainly due to tight credit and
unstable financial market conditions as well as increasing
energy prices.  The region's emerging markets will remain
largely unaffected by these uncertainties,  with GDP growth forecasted to be around 5 %. 
In North America,  GDP growth is projected to decline versus
the prior year to a level below 2 %.  Of particular concern is
an expected further weakening of consumer spending in the
first six months of the year,  driven by the persistent challenges of the housing market and continuing high oil prices. 
 government-sponsored stimulus package,  however,  is
expected to help US consumer confidence improve modestly
in the second half of 2008. 

In Asia,  the region's most populous countries,  such as China
and India,  are expected to remain the largest contributors
to the region's growth in 2008.  Compared to 2007,  growth
in Asia excluding Japan is likely to slow slightly to a level
around 9 %,  with consumer confidence in most countries
expected to continue to grow strongly despite financial market
volatility.  For Japan,  increased global financial market
instability has clouded the near-term outlook and economic
growth is projected to slow to a level of no more than 2 %. 
Sound corporate earnings,  rising employment and encouraging export signals are expected to be tempered by a
weakening in domestic demand led by lackluster consumer
spending. 
Growth in Latin America is likely to decline slightly compared
to the prior year to a level below 45 %.  As in previous yearsprivate consumption as well as buoyant exports will be the key
drivers of economic growth.  Nevertheless,  consumer confidence in the region is expected to moderate. 
MIXED OUTLOOK FOR THE GLOBAL SPORTING GOODS
INDUSTRY In 2008,  the global sporting goods industry is projected to grow modestly.  Although strong increases are expected
in Asia,  Latin America and Europe's emerging markets,  the
US market is forecasted to decline modestly. 
EUROPEAN SPORTING GOODS INDUSTRY TO GROW MODERATELY We expect the European sporting goods market to grow
at a low-single-digit rate.  During the first half of 2008,  the
industry is expected to largely focus on the UEFA EURO 2008™. 
This should provide positive impetus to otherwise slow retail
markets in Western Europe.  However,  the impact is likely
to be somewhat less than what was initially anticipated due
to the failure of England to qualify.  Traditionally,  England has
been the region's largest football licensed apparel market. 
Following the event,  regional growth for the sector is likely to
be driven by emerging markets,  in particular Russia. 

NORTH AMERICAN SPORTING GOODS MARKET EXPECTED TO
DECLINE In North America,  we project a declining market in 2008. 
Lower overall consumer spending coupled with promotional
activity among mall-based retailers and a polarization of price
points are likely to further burden the market.  Mixed development
of product categories and distribution channels is expected to
continue throughout 2008.  Whereas growth in running and soccer
footwear as well as training apparel is projected to continue,  sales
in the basketball and Classics categories are expected to decline. 
In addition,  we expect the region's golf market to remain highly
competitive in 2008 as many market participants introduce new
technologies that capitalize on the recent rulings by the USGA
(United States Golf Association),  allowing for a broader interpretation of adjustability in both metalwoods and irons. 

119

ASIAN SPORTING GOODS INDUSTRY FORECASTED TO
EXPAND FURTHER The sporting goods market in Asia is
expected to continue to grow at a high-single-digit rate.  In Japanweak overall private consumption may affect average selling
prices in the industry.  In the emerging markets,  especially
China,  the industry is likely to grow at low-double-digit levels
driven by the upcoming Olympics Games in Beijing. 
INCREASING TRADE BARRIERS DAMPEN LATIN AMERICAN
SPORTING GOODS INDUSTRY GROWTH Mid-single-digit
industry growth rates are expected in Latin America.  The
momentum of the region's sporting goods industry is projected
to remain intact,  but there are concerns related to increasing
trade barriers being implemented in certain markets such
as Argentina and Brazil.

ADIDAS GROUP SALES TO EXCEED ECONOMIC GROWTH RATES
Based on our strength in innovation,  operational execution and
regional diversification,  we are confident that the Group's net
sales increase in 2008 will again exceed growth rates of the
global economy.  We also expect Group sales growth to be at
least in line with the overall development of the sporting goods
industry.  Sales in Asia and Latin America are expected to grow
at double-digit rates due to our strong brand recognition and
growing distribution infrastructure.  This increase is forecasted
to exceed both economic and industry growth rates.  Mid- to
high-single-digit growth rates are expected in Europe,  positively impacted by the UEFA EURO 2008™.  This expectation
exceeds projected growth rates for both the economy and the
industry in this region.  Sales in North America,  however,  are
projected to decline modestly as a result of the challenging
market environment and intensified retail competition.  This
development is likely to be in line with sector development in
the region. 

HIGH-SINGLE-DIGIT SALES INCREASE EXPECTED AT BRAND
ADIDAS We project high-single-digit currency-neutral sales
growth for brand adidas in 2008.  Both the adidas Sport
Performance and adidas Sport Style divisions are forecasted
to grow.  In the Sport Performance division,  we expect football
to be one of the fastest-growing category in 2008.  As Official
Sponsor of the UEFA EURO 2008™,  adidas will benefit from
this event in terms of additional sales of football products. 
In addition,  we expect strong improvements in the Sport
Performance running,  training and basketball categoriessupported by a compelling pipeline of product launches. 
Strong order backlogs and positive retailer and trade show
feedback as well as expected further own-retail expansionfor which order backlogs are not included in the order booksupport our ambitious growth expectations for 2008. 
ADIDAS BACKLOGS GROW STRONGLY Backlogs for the adidas
brand at the end of 2007 increased 17 % versus the prior year
on a currency-neutral basis.  This improvement was supported
by adidas' strength in all major categories.  Order backlogs in
Europe were positively impacted by orders for UEFA EURO
2008™ related products.  In euro terms,  adidas backlogs grew
12 %.  Footwear backlogs increased 13 % in currency-neutral
terms (+ 8 % in euros).  Double-digit growth in both Asia and
Europe more than offset a decline in North America.  Apparel
backlogs grew 20 % on a currency-neutral basis (+ 15 % in
euros),  driven by strong double-digit increases in Asia and
Europe.  Hardware backlogs grew at a double-digit rate due to
increases in Asia and Europe.

LOW- TO MID-SINGLE-DIGIT SALES INCREASE EXPECTED
FOR REEBOK SEGMENT Currency-neutral Reebok segment
sales are projected to grow at a low- to mid-single-digit
rate in 2008.  Sales are expected to increase at Reebok,  ReebokCCM Hockey and Rockport.  At brand Reebok,  we continue to
focus on improving the brand's position in performance sports. 
This effort will be driven by several product launches in Reebok's
running and women's categories.  see Reebok Products and Campaignsp.  138 In addition,  product launches in American sports will
highlight additional focus on the key North American market. 
Our efforts to broaden the brand's lifestyle offering will also
become more visible.  We anticipate a positive sales
development at Reebok-CCM Hockey and Rockport,  supported
by the launch of new product lines.  Retailer and trade show
feedback,  especially in emerging markets,  supports Reebok's
2008 growth expectations. 

MID-SINGLE-DIGIT SALES INCREASE EXPECTED AT
TAYLORMADE-ADIDAS GOLF We expect our strong product
pipeline to help increase currency-neutral TaylorMadeadidas Golf sales at a mid-single-digit rate in 2008.  Growth
will mainly be driven by new product launches including
TaylorMade metalwoods and irons as well as adidas Golf
footwear and apparel. 
Because the order profile in golf differs from other parts of
our Group's business,  we do not provide order information for
TaylorMade-adidas Golf.  However,  trade show performance
and ongoing dialog with customers both support our expectation of continued positive development in the segment. 

REEBOK BACKLOGS DECLINE Currency-neutral Reebok backlogs at the end of 2007 were down 8 % versus the prior year
on a currency-neutral basis.  In euro terms,  this represents a
decline of 14 %.  Footwear backlogs decreased 12 % in currencyneutral terms (– 18 % in euros).  This is the result of lower
orders from mall-based retailers in North America scheduled
for delivery in the first half of 2008.  Apparel backlogs grew by 3 %
on a currency-neutral basis (– 3 % in euros).  Hardware backlogs
declined at a double-digit rate due to decreases in the hockey
category.  Backlogs at Reebok,  however,  are expected to
improve over the course of the year due to an improved product mix and the launch of the 'Your Move" brand campaign.

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR FINANCIAL YEAR  Outlook 
GROUP GROSS MARGIN TO FURTHER IMPROVE In 2008,  the
adidas Group gross margin is expected to increase modestly
to a range of 475 to 48 %,  driven by improvements in all three
brand segments. 
Gross margin improvement in the adidas segment will be
largely related to further own-retail expansion and an improving product and regional mix. 
We also anticipate a gross margin improvement in the Reebok
segment due to an improving product mix as a result of the
focus on higher-margin product segments.  Lower clearance
activities as well as an improving distribution and regional mix
are also expected to contribute to gross margin expansion
within the Reebok segment.  Further,  for both adidas and
Reebok,  we will continue our efforts to increase operational
efficiency throughout the Group's supply chain in 2008,  which
will continue to positively impact cost of sales. 

OPERATING EXPENSES TO INCREASE In 2008,  Group operating
expenses as a percentage of sales are expected to be higher
than in the prior year,  as a result of increases in all three
brand segments.  This mainly reflects increases in the marketing
working budget as a percentage of sales at both adidas and
Reebok.  Operating overhead costs as a percentage of sales are
expected to increase modestly in all brand segments. 
MARKETING WORKING BUDGET TO INCREASE Group marketing working budget as a percentage of sales is expected to
increase in 2008.  Marketing expenses at brand adidas are forecasted to increase mainly in conjunction with the major 2008
sporting events: the UEFA EURO 2008™ and the Beijing 2008
Olympic Games.  Reebok's marketing working budget is forecasted to grow as a result of the launch of Reebok's new 2008
brand campaign 'Your Move".  see Reebok Products and Campaignsp.  138 The marketing working budget at TaylorMade-adidas Golf
is expected to remain stable as a percentage of sales in 2008. 

The gross margin at TaylorMade-adidas Golf is also expected
to increase,  largely driven by an improving product mix and
lower clearance activities. 
In addition,  the expiration of the Group's cooperation agreement
with Amer Sports Corporation in the first quarter of 2008 is
expected to support gross margin development in the HQ / Consolidation segment.  The continued strength of the euro is likely
to have a modest positive impact on gross margin in 2008. 
Further,  positive gross margin developments in all segments
are expected to moderate during the course of 2008,  mainly as
 result of higher raw material prices,  increased freight rates
and higher labor costs.

MODEST INCREASE IN OPERATING OVERHEAD COSTS
EXPECTED The adidas Group's operating overhead costs as
 percentage of sales are expected to grow modestly due to
increases in all brand segments,  largely as a result of the
expansion of own-retail activities at adidas and Reebok in fastgrowing emerging markets such as Russia.  This will more than
offset cost synergies related to the Reebok integration into the
adidas Group.  Operating overhead costs as a percentage of sales
at TaylorMade-adidas Golf are also expected to increase
modestly due to our plans to expand TaylorMade's presence
in the golf ball category.  A portion of the operating overhead
increases at the brands will be offset by lower costs in the
HQ / Consolidation segment.  These are expected to decline
as a percentage of sales due to increasing cost synergies
resulting from the Reebok integration. 
Primarily as a result of the anticipated strong retail expansion
and growth in the emerging markets,  we expect the number
of employees within the adidas Group to grow modestly. 
Accordingly,  personnel expenses for the adidas Group will
also increase. 
The adidas Group will continue to spend around 1 % of sales on
research and development in 2008.  Areas of particular focus
include running,  football,  basketball and training at the adidas
and Reebok brands,  as well as golf hardware at TaylorMadeadidas Golf.  The number of employees working in research
and development throughout the Group will increase in 2008 to
support our increasing number of innovation projects.

Accounting effects related to purchase price allocation following the Reebok acquisition are expected to impact Group
operating expenses in a range of € 10 million to € 20 million
in 2008 (2007: € 12 million). 

OPERATING MARGIN TO SHOW IMPROVEMENT In 2008,  we
expect the operating margin for the adidas Group to increase
to at least 95 % from 92 % in 2007 as a result of operating
margin improvements in all segments.  Gross margin improvements are expected to more than compensate operating overhead increases as a percentage of sales in all segments. 

123

NET INCOME FOR THE ADIDAS GROUP TO GROW AT LEAST
15% Net income attributable to shareholders is projected
to grow by at least 15% in 2008 versus the 2007 level of
€ 551 million.  This represents the eighth consecutive year
of double-digit net income growth.  Top-line improvement and
an increased operating margin will be the primary drivers of
this positive development.  In addition,  we expect slightly lower
interest expenses as a result of a reduction in average debt to
also have a positive impact on net income.  However,  this effect
will be partially offset by a higher tax rate versus the prior year
as a result of small changes in the earnings mix.  Minority
interests are expected to remain broadly unchanged in 2008. 
WORKING CAPITAL MANAGEMENT TO IMPROVE BALANCE
SHEET Operating working capital management is a major focus
of our efforts to improve the Group's balance sheet.  see Internal
Group Management System,  p.  056 Our goal is to further reduce operating working capital as a percentage of sales in 2008.  Inventory
management in particular will be an important mechanism for
the realization of further improvements.  Optimizing inventory
levels for fast replenishment and rigorous control of inventory
aging are the top priorities for our Working Capital Task Force
in 2008.  We also target further improvement in accounts
receivable by improving collection efforts,  and in accounts payable by optimizing payment terms with our suppliers.

INVESTMENT LEVEL TO BE BETWEEN € 300 MILLION AND
€ 400 MILLION In 2008,  investments in tangible and intangible
assets are expected to amount to € 300 million to € 400 million
(2007: € 289 million).  Expenditures will focus on own-retail
expansion and retail support at brand adidas.  In emerging
markets,  own-retail expansion of the Reebok brand will also
impact investments.  Expenditure per brand will be roughly in
line with our sales split. 
Around 50 % of total investments in 2008 will be dedicated to controlled space initiatives within the adidas Group.  Other areas
of investment are the increased deployment of SAP and other
IT systems in major subsidiaries within the Group,  the further
development of the adidas Group Headquarters in Herzogenaurach,  Germany,  as well as investments for the joint adidas
and Reebok warehouse projects in the USA and UK in order
to generate cost synergies in the future.  The most important
factors in determining the exact level and timing of investments
will be the rate at which we are able to successfully secure
controlled space opportunities and integrate new SAP systems
within existing applications.  All investments within the adidas
Group are expected to be fully covered through cash generated
in our operating business. 
EXCESS CASH TO BE USED FOR ADIDAS SHARE BUYBACK
In 2008,  we expect continued strong cash flows from operating
activities.  We intend to largely invest our excess cash of
€ 300 million to € 400 million in the buyback of adidas shares
to support earnings per share growth for increasing shareholder value.  see Subsequent Events,  p.  117 As a result,  we expect
net borrowings to be at or slightly below the prior year level. 
Cash inflows from operating activities will be used to finance
working capital needs,  investment activities as well as dividend
payments.  Tight working capital management and disciplined
investment activities are expected to help optimize the Group's
cash flow in 2008.  For 2009 and beyond,  we see the potential
for free cash flow generation to increase and we are well on
track to achieving our medium-term financial leverage target
of below 50 % (2007: 584 %). 

GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR FINANCIAL YEAR  Outlook 
EFFICIENT LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT IN PLACE FOR 2008 AND
BEYOND Efficient liquidity management continues to be a priority for the adidas Group in 2008.  We focus on continuously
anticipating the cash inflows from the operating activities of our
Group segments as this represents the main source of liquidity
within the Group.  Liquidity is forecasted on a multi-year financial and liquidity plan on a quarterly basis.  Long-term liquidity
is ensured by continued positive free cash flows and sufficient
unused credit lines.  see Treasury,  p.  091 Consequently,  we do not
plan any significant financing initiatives in 2008. 
19 % DIVIDEND INCREASE TO BE PROPOSED We are committed to maintaining the Group's dividend payout ratio corridor of between 15 and 25 % of net income.  At our Annual
General Meeting on May 8,  2008,  we intend to propose a
dividend of € 050 per share for the 2007 financial year
(2006: € 042).  Based on the number of shares outstanding
at the end of 2007,  the dividend payout will increase 19 %
to € 102 million (2006: € 85 million),  outpacing the earnings
growth of 14 % for the year.  This represents a payout ratio of
19 % versus 18 % in 2006,  highlighting our confidence in the
Group's future business performance.  However,  as a result
of the share buyback program,  the total dividend payout and
the payout ratio could decrease slightly.  Going forward,  we
expect the dividend payout to grow broadly in line with net
income attributable to shareholders. 
NO MAJOR CHANGES IN LEGAL STRUCTURE EXPECTED In
2008,  we expect only minor legal changes within the adidas
Group.  Changes in the Reebok segment could arise from the
buyback of Reebok distribution rights,  which will be evaluated
on a case-by-case basis in 2008.  Buybacks could be realized
in countries where we anticipate long-term growth opportunities for the Reebok business and the price for a buyback is
reasonable.  In the TaylorMade-adidas Golf segment,  no major
changes will arise from the divestiture of the Maxfli brand. 
see Subsequent Events,  p.  117

AMBITIOUS NON-FINANCIAL GOALS FOR 2008 AND BEYOND
In addition to our Group's ambitious financial targets for 2008we have several non-financial targets to ensure the continued
long-term success of the adidas Group.  Major non-financial
developments within the adidas Group in 2008 and beyond are
expected to be:


Controlled space: We intend to increase our controlled space
initiatives see Group Strategy,  p.  044 to at least 30 % of Group sales
by 2010.  As a result,  we intend to further grow our Group's
own-retail activities.  New openings will concentrate on emerging markets,  in particular Russia.  Here,  we plan to open over
100 stores for the Group in 2008.  We are also extending our
franchise network in countries such as India,  Turkey,  Korea
and Poland.  Our mono-branded adidas and Reebok store base
in China is targeted to increase to 7000 stores by 2010 (year-end
2007: around 4000).  In addition,  key account initiatives such as
shop-in-shop or similar solutions,  especially in the USA and
UK,  are an important trend that we plan to extend substantially
going forward. 


Global Operations: As our products are almost entirely manufactured by independent suppliers,  our Group's Global Operations
function continuously strives to optimize our Group's supplier
network and implement initiatives to maximize cost efficiencyreduce lead times and ensure consistently high product quality. 
In 2008,  we are again committed to further supply chain
improvements.  see Global Operations,  p.  062


Sustainability: As a responsible company,  we are committed
to further strengthening our social and environmental performance in the coming years.  For 2008,  we plan to further intensify
our outreach to governments in key sourcing countries to promote
social and legislative changes for the benefit of our employees
and our suppliers' workers.  In addition,  we strive to improve
the external monitoring of our tier two and three suppliers. 
Finally,  we plan to commission external verification of the tools
and processes developed for selecting organic and recycled
materials used in our products.

We have an ambitious target to generate around € 500 million
of incremental revenues by 2009 related to the Reebok
integration.  We estimate one-time expenses associated with
the generation of revenue synergies to be between € 15 million and € 25 million in 2009.  Specific initiatives to generate
revenue synergies include:


Branded apparel: We expect to deliver around € 100 million
from leveraging adidas' industry-leading branded apparel
know-how to strengthen and expand Reebok's branded apparel
efforts. 


Licensed products: At brand adidas,  we expect to generate
around € 100 million of additional sales in licensed products. 
Having transferred the NBA contract to adidas,  we can further
expand this exclusive partnership more effectively in particular outside of North America.  We will also focus on utilizing
Reebok's sales and production capabilities for licensed products of brand adidas,  particularly in North America. 


Regional initiatives: We expect around € 100 million of
incremental revenue synergies from greater regional traction
in Europe and Asia.  This will result from Reebok product
category initiatives in underdeveloped markets with a strong
existing adidas infrastructure. 


Distributor buyouts: We project around € 200 million in
incremental sales synergies to result from exercising more
control over the Reebok brand around the globe,  particularly
in high-growth markets in Asia and Latin America as well as
Emerging Europe.  This will be achieved by buying out distributors and joint venture partners.

2009 COST SYNERGIES FROM REEBOK INTEGRATION During
our integration planning phase,  we identified significant annual
cost of sales and operating expense synergy potential.  We
expect to realize the full amount of around € 175 million in
2009.  In particular,  we project cost savings to come from the
following areas:

high-single-digit
46 % to 48 %
approx.  11 %
double-digit 

Sales and marketing,  distribution,  administration and IT:
We have also identified the opportunity to generate operating
expense savings by realizing various initiatives such as joint
media buying,  office consolidation in Europe and Asia,  harmonizing and consolidating our IT systems,  eliminating duplicative
corporate functions and sharing finance and administrative
services across the Group. 
2009 OUTLOOK CONFIRMED As a result of continued underlying growth of our brands and the synergies from the Reebok
integration,  we expect a strong top- and bottom-line development
again in 2009.  We project Group sales to increase at a highsingle-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis.  This development
will be driven by continued strength at adidas and TaylorMadeadidas Golf as well as the ongoing revitalization of the Reebok
business segment.  The Group's gross margin is expected to be
between 46 and 48 % in 2009.  Positive effects from an improving product and geographical mix,  own-retail expansion and
cost synergies derived as a result of the integration of Reebok
will be largely offset by increasing input prices driven by higher
raw material prices,  freight rates and labor costs.  We also
expect the Group's operating margin to increase to approximately 11 % in 2009,  driven by a modestly lower marketing
working budget as well as efficiency gains largely related
to Reebok integration cost synergies.  This is expected to lead
to an improvement of the Group's operating expenses as a
percentage of sales.  Net income is forecasted to increase at
 double-digit rate in 2009 as a result of our continuing top-line
growth and improved profitability projected at all brands.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

We have audited the consolidated financial statements prepared by adidas AG,  Herzogenaurach
– comprising the balance sheet,  the income statement,  statement of recognized income and
expense,  cash flow statement and the notes to the consolidated financial statements together
with the Group Management Report for the business year from January 1,  2007 to December 312007.  The preparation of the consolidated financial statements and the Group Management
Report in accordance with IFRS,  as adopted by the EU,  and the additional requirements of
German commercial law pursuant to § 315a section 1 HGB (Handelsgesetzbuch 'German Commercial Code") are the responsibility of the parent company's Management.  Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and on the Group Management
Report based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with § 317 HGB
and German generally accepted standards for the audit of financial statements promulgated
by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW).  Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit such that misstatements materially affecting the presentation of the net assets,  financial position and results of operations in the consolidated financial statements in accordance
with the applicable financial reporting framework and in the Group Management Report are
detected with reasonable assurance.  Knowledge of the business activities and the economic
and legal environment of the Group and expectations as to possible misstatements are taken
into account in the determination of audit procedures.  The effectiveness of the accountingrelated internal control system and the evidence supporting the disclosures in the consolidated
financial statements and the Group Management Report are examined primarily on a test basis
within the framework of the audit.  The audit includes assessing the annual financial statements
of those entities included in consolidation,  the determination of entities to be included in consolidation,  the accounting and consolidation principles used and significant estimates made by
Management,  as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and Group Management Report.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion. 
Our audit has not led to any reservations. 
In our opinion,  based on the findings of our audit,  the consolidated financial statements comply
with IFRS,  as adopted by the EU,  and the additional requirements of German commercial law
pursuant to § 315a section 1 HGB and give a true and fair view of the net assets,  financial position and results of operations of the Group in accordance with these requirements.  The Group
Management Report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and as a whole
provides a suitable view of the Group's position and suitably presents the opportunities and risks
of future development.

CURRENCY TRANSLATION Transactions of assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currency at spot rates on the transaction date. 
In the individual financial statements of Group companies,  monetary items denominated in
non-functional currencies of the subsidiaries,  are generally measured at closing exchange rates
at the balance sheet date.  The resulting currency gains and losses are recorded directly in
income. 
Assets and liabilities of the Group's non-euro functional currency subsidiaries are translated
into the reporting currency the 'euro",  which is also the functional currency of adidas AGat closing exchange rates at the balance sheet date.  Revenues and expenses are translated
at exchange rates on the transaction dates.  All cumulative differences from the translation of
equity of foreign subsidiaries resulting from changes in exchange rates,  are included in a separate item within shareholders' equity without affecting income. 
 summary of exchange rates to the euro for major currencies in which the Group operates
is as follows:

 schedule of the shareholdings of adidas AG is shown in Attachment II to these Notes.  Furthera schedule of these shareholdings will be published on the electronic platform of the German
Federal Gazette. 
The first-time consolidation of purchased companies had a material impact in 2006.  see Note 4
Within the scope of the first-time consolidation,  all acquired assets and liabilities are recognized in the balance sheet at fair value.  A debit difference between the investment book value
and the proportionate fair value of assets and liabilities is shown as goodwill.  A credit difference
is recorded in the income statement.  No fair value adjustments are recognized at the first-time
consolidation of acquired minority interests in companies accounted for using the purchase
method.  A debit difference between the cost for such an additional investment and the carrying
amount of the net assets at the acquisition date is shown as goodwill.  A credit difference is
recorded in the income statement. 
All intercompany transactions and balances,  as well as any unrealized gains and losses
arising from intercompany transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial
statements.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Group uses derivative financial instruments,  such
as interest and currency options,  forward contracts,  as well as interest rate swaps and crosscurrency interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks. 
In accordance with its treasury policy,  the Group does not enter into derivative financial instruments with banks for trading purposes. 
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognized in the balance sheet at fair valueand subsequently also measured at their fair value.  The method of recognizing the resulting
gains or losses is dependent on the nature of the item being hedged.  On the date a derivative
contract is entered into,  the Group designates certain derivatives as either a hedge of a forecasted transaction (cash flow hedge),  a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability
(fair value hedge) or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign entity. 

ANNUAL REPORT 2007 -- adidas Group 
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges,  and
that are 100% effective,  as defined in IAS 39,  are recognized in equity.  When the effectiveness is
not 100%,  the ineffective portion of the fair value is recognized in net income.  Cumulated gains
and losses in equity are transferred to the income statement in the same periods during which
the hedged forecasted transaction affects the income statement. 
For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges,  the gains or losses on the derivatives and the offsetting gains or losses on the hedged items are recognized immediately in net
income. 
Certain derivative transactions,  while providing effective economic hedges under the Group's
risk management policies,  may not qualify for hedge accounting under the specific rules of IAS
39.  Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39 are recognized immediately in the income statement. 
Hedges of net investments in foreign entities are accounted for in a similar way to cash flow
hedges.  If,  for example,  the hedging instrument is a derivative (e.g.  a forward contract) or,  for
example,  a foreign currency borrowing,  effective currency gains and losses in the derivative and
all gains and losses arising on the translation of the borrowing,  respectively,  are recognized in
equity. 
The Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items at
transaction inception,  as well as the risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking
various hedge transactions.  This process includes linking all derivatives designated as hedges
to specific forecasted transactions.  The Group also documents its assessment of whether the
derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective by using different methods
of effectiveness testing,  such as the 'dollar offset method" or the 'hypothetical derivative
method". 
The fair values of forward contracts and currency options are determined on the basis of
market conditions on the reporting dates.  The fair value of a currency option is determined using
generally accepted models to calculate option prices.  The fair market value of an option is
influenced not only by the remaining term of the option but also by additional factors,  such as
the actual foreign exchange rate and the volatility of the underlying foreign currency base.  The
fair values of interest rate options on the reporting date are assessed by generally accepted
models,  such as the 'Markov functional model". 
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash and cash equivalents represent cash and short-term bank
deposits with maturities of three months or less from the date of acquisition. 
RECEIVABLES AND OTHER ASSETS Receivables and other assets are recognized at fair valuewhich is estimated as the present value of future cash flows discounted at the market rate of
interest at the balance sheet date.  If necessary,  required allowances are determined on the basis
of individual risk assessment and past experience of losses. 

INVENTORIES Merchandise and finished goods are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable
value,  which is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated
costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.  Costs are determined
using a standard valuation method: the 'average cost method".  Costs of finished goods include
cost of raw materials,  direct labor and the components of the manufacturing overheads which
can reasonably be attributed.  The net realizable value allowances are computed consistently
throughout the Group based on the age and expected future sales of the items on hand. 

159

ASSETS / LIABILITIES CLASSIFIED AS HELD-FOR-SALE Assets and liabilities (primarily noncurrent) that are expected to be recovered principally through sale rather than through continuing use are classified as held-for-sale.  These are measured at the lower of their carrying
amount and fair value less cost to sell. 
PROPERTY,  PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Property,  plant and equipment are stated at cost (which
comprises any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the condition necessary for it to
be capable of operating in the manner intended by Management) less accumulated depreciation
(except for land and construction in progress) and accumulated impairment losses.  Depreciation
is computed utilizing the 'straight-line method",  except where the 'declining-balance method"
is more appropriate in light of the actual utilization pattern.  Useful lives are as follows:
USEFUL LIVES OF PROPERTY,  PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

Years 
Buildings / Leasehold improvements
Technical equipment and machinery as well as other equipment and furniture and fittings 
 50
 10

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.  Renewals and improvements are capitalized and depreciated separately,  if the recognition criteria are met. 
IMPAIRMENT In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the cost of non-current
assets (financial and non-financial assets) should be impaired,  an evaluation of recoverability is
performed.  An impairment loss is recognized in the income statement if the carrying amount
exceeds the recoverable amount.  If there is an impairment loss for a cash-generating unit,  first
the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cash-generating unit is reduced,  and subsequently the other assets of the unit are reduced pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount
of each asset in the unit. 

05

ANNUAL REPORT 2007 -- adidas Group 
160

Irrespective of whether there is an impairment indication,  intangible assets with an indefinite
useful life and goodwill acquired in business combinations are tested annually for impairment. 
An impairment loss recognized in goodwill is not reversible.  With respect to other assetsan impairment loss recognized in prior periods is reversed if there has been a change in the
estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.  An impairment loss is reversed only to
the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would
have been determined (net of depreciation or amortization) if no impairment loss had been
recognized. 
LEASES If substantially all risks and rewards associated with an asset are transferred to the
Group under finance lease agreements,  the asset less accumulated depreciation and the corresponding liability are recognized at the fair value of the asset or the lower net present value of
the minimum lease payments.  Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance
charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability.  The finance expense is allocated to each
period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic interest rate on the remaining
balance of the liability. 
Under operating lease agreements,  rent expenses are recognized on a straight-line basis
over the term of the lease. 
IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS Acquired intangible assets are valued at cost less accumulated amortization (except for assets with indefinite useful lives) and impairment losses.  Amortization is calculated on a straight-line basis with the following useful lives:

In 2007,  the adidas Group determined that there was no impairment necessary for any of its
trademarks with indefinite useful lives. 
The recoverable amount is determined on the basis of fair value less costs to sell,  which are
calculated with 1 % of the fair value.  The fair value is determined through discounting the royalty
savings after tax and adding a tax amortization benefit,  resulting from the amortization of the
acquired asset (relief-from-royalty method).  These calculations use projections of net sales
related royalty savings,  based on financial planning which covers a period of five years in total. 
Royalty savings beyond this period are extrapolated using steady growth rates of 25% (2006:
2%).  The growth rates do not exceed the long-term average growth rate of the business to which
the trademarks are allocated. 
The discount rate is based on a weighted average cost of capital calculation considering a
five-year average debt/equity structure and financing costs including the Group's major competitors.  The discount rate used is after-tax rates and reflects specific equity and country risk.  The
applied discount rate is 75 % (2006: 75 %). 
Expenditures for internally generated intangible assets are expensed as incurred if they do
not qualify for recognition. 
GOODWILL Goodwill is the excess of the purchase cost over the fair value of acquired identifiable
assets and liabilities.  Goodwill arising from the acquisition of a foreign entity and any fair value
adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities of that foreign entity,  are treated as
assets and liabilities of the reporting entity respectively,  and are translated at exchange rates
prevailing at the date of the initial consolidation.  Goodwill is carried in the functional currency of
the acquired foreign entity. 
Acquired goodwill is valued at cost less accumulated impairment losses.  Effective January 12005,  scheduled amortization of goodwill ceased due to changes in IFRS.  Goodwill is tested annually for impairment,  and additionally when there are indications of potential impairment. 
Goodwill has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to three cash-generating units. 
The Group's cash-generating units are identified according to brand of operations in line with the
internal management approach.  The adidas Group has thus defined the three segments adidasReebok and TaylorMade-adidas Golf as the relevant cash-generating units.

In 2007,  the adidas Group determined that no impairment of goodwill was necessary. 
The recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is determined on the basis of fair value
less costs to sell,  which are calculated with 1 % of the fair value.  These calculations use cash
flow projections based on the financial planning covering a five-year period in total.  Cash flows
beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using steady growth rates of 20 % to 25 % (2006:
 %).  These growth rates do not exceed the long-term average growth rate of the business in
which each cash-generating unit operates. 
Discount rates are based on a weighted average cost of capital calculation considering a
five-year average debt / equity structure and financing costs including the Group's major competitors of each cash-generating unit.  The discount rates used are after-tax rates and reflect the
specific equity and country risk of the relevant cash-generating unit.  The applied discount rates
for specific cash-generating units are between 75 % and 84 % (2006: between 72 % and 80 %). 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Research costs are expensed as incurred.  Development costs
are also expensed as incurred when recognition criteria are not met. 
The Group spent € 84 million and € 98 million on product research and development for the
years ending December 31,  2007 and 2006,  respectively. 

FINANCIAL ASSETS All purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized on the trade date. 
Costs of purchases include transaction costs.  If the fair value of available-for-sale financial
assets (i.  e.  non-derivative financial assets which are not allocable under another category of IAS
39) can be measured reliably,  they are subsequently carried at fair value.  Realized and
unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of financial assets are
included in the income statement for the period in which they arise except for available-for-sale
financial assets where unrealized gains and losses are recognized in equity unless they are
impaired. 

161

BORROWINGS AND OTHER LIABILITIES Borrowings and other liabilities are recognized at fair
value using the effective interest method,  net of transaction costs incurred.  In subsequent
periods,  long-term borrowings are stated at amortized cost using the 'effective interest
method".  Any difference between proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value
is recognized in the income statement over the term of the borrowing. 
The fair value of the liability component of the Group's convertible bond is determined using
 market interest rate for a comparable straight bond.  This amount is presented as part of longterm borrowings on an amortized cost basis until conversion or maturity of the bond.  The
remaining portion is included in shareholders' equity where the value of the equity component is
not changed in subsequent periods. 
ACCRUED LIABILITIES AND PROVISIONS Provisions are recognized where a present obligation
(legal or constructive) to third parties has been incurred which is likely to lead to an outflow
of resources where the timing or amount is uncertain.  Non-current provisions are discounted
if the effect of discounting is material. 
With respect to accrued liabilities,  the timing and amount of an outflow of resources is not
uncertain. 
PENSIONS AND SIMILAR OBLIGATIONS Provisions for pensions and similar obligations comprise the Group provision obligation under defined benefit and contribution plans.  Obligations
under defined benefit plans are calculated separately for each plan by estimating the benefit
amount that employees have earned in return for their service during the current and prior
periods.  That benefit is discounted to determine its present value,  and the fair value of any plan
assets is deducted.  The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on high-quality
corporate bonds.  Calculations are performed by qualified actuaries using the projected unit
credit method in accordance with IAS 19.  Obligations for contributions to defined contribution
plans are recognized as an expense in the income statement when they are due. 
As of January 1,  2005,  due to application of the amendment to IAS 19 ('Employee Benefits"
issued in December 2004),  the Group recognizes actuarial gains or losses to defined benefit
plans arising during the financial year immediately outside the income statement in 'other
reserves" within equity as shown in the statement of recognized income and expense.

RECOGNITION OF REVENUES Sales are recognized at the fair value of the consideration received
or receivable,  net of returns,  trade discounts and volume rebates,  when the significant risks and
rewards of ownership of the goods are transferred to the buyer,  and when it is probable that the
economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group. 
Royalty and commission income is recognized based on the contract terms on an accrual
basis. 
ADVERTISING AND PROMOTIONAL EXPENDITURES Production costs for media campaigns are
included in prepaid expenses (other current and non-current assets) until the advertising is
finalized,  after which they are expensed in full.  Significant media buying costs (e.g.  broadcasting
fees) are expensed over the original duration of the campaign after usage. 
Promotional expenses,  including one-time up-front payments for promotional contracts,  are
expensed systematically over the term of the agreements. 
INTEREST Interest is recognized as income or expense as incurred (using the effective interest
method) and is not capitalized. 
INCOME TAXES Current income taxes are computed in accordance with the applicable taxation
rules established in the countries in which the Group operates. 
The Group computes deferred taxes for all temporary differences between the carrying
amount and the tax base of its assets and liabilities and tax loss carry-forwards.  As it is not
permitted to recognize a deferred tax liability for goodwill,  the Group does not compute any
deferred taxes thereon. 
Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences and tax loss carry-forwards which exceed taxable temporary differences are only recognized to the extent that it is
probable that the company concerned will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the
associated benefit. 
Income tax is recognized in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items
recognized directly in equity,  in which case it is recognized in equity. 

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Notes 
EQUITY COMPENSATION BENEFITS Stock options were granted to members of the Executive
Board of adidas AG as well as to the managing directors / senior vice presidents of its affiliated
companies and to further senior executives of the Group in connection with the Management
Share Option Plan (MSOP) of adidas AG.  see also Note 32 The Company has the choice to settle
 potential obligation by issuing new shares or providing the equivalent cash compensation. 
When options are exercised and the Company decides to issue new shares,  the proceeds
received net of any transaction costs are credited to share capital and capital surplus.  In the
past,  the Company has chosen to issue new shares.  It is planned to maintain this methodology
in the future. 
In accordance with IFRS 2,  an expense and a corresponding entry to equity for equity-settled
stock options and an expense and a liability for cash-settled stock options is recorded. 
The Group has applied IFRS 2 retrospectively and has taken advantage of the transitional
provisions of IFRS 2 with respect to equity-settled awards.  As a result,  the Group has applied
IFRS 2 only to equity-settled awards granted after November 7,  2002,  that had not yet vested on
January 1,  2005 [Tranche V (2003)]. 
ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTIES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS
requires the use of assumptions and estimates that affect reported amounts and related disclosures.  Although such estimates are based on Management's best knowledge of current
events and actions,  actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates. 
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty
at the balance sheet date which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are outlined in the
respective Notes,  in particular goodwill see Note 11,  trademarks see Note 12,  provisions
see Note 16,  pensions
see Note 18 as well as deferred taxes
see Note 27. 

ANNUAL REPORT 2007 -- adidas Group

Cash outflow on acquisition 
Pre-acquisition carrying amounts were based on applicable IFRS standards. 
The following valuation methods for the acquired assets were applied:
- Inventories: The pro rata basis valuation was applied for estimating the fair value of acquired
inventories.  Realized margins were added to the book values of acquired inventories.  Subsequently,  the costs for completion for selling,  advertising and general administration as well as a
reasonable profit allowance were deducted. 

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Notes  Notes to the Consolidated Balance Sheet 
- Property,  plant and equipment: The 'comparison method" was used for acquired land by
considering the prices paid for comparable properties.  The 'direct capitalization method" was
applied for the valuation of all acquired buildings.  Annual rents which could be realized in the
future were discounted following adjustments for risk factors and deduction of applicable
operating costs.  The acquired machinery and equipment was valued utilizing the depreciated
replacement cost method.  The replacement costs were determined by applying an index to the
asset's historical cost.  The replacement costs were then adjusted for the loss in value caused
by depreciation. 
- Trademarks and other intangible assets: The 'relief-from-royalty method" was applied for
trademarks and technologies.  The fair value was determined by discounting the royalty savings
after tax and adding a tax amortization benefit,  resulting from the amortization of the acquired
asset.  For the valuation of licensing agreements,  customer relationships and order backlogs,  the
'multi-period-excess-earnings method" was used.  The respective future excess cash flows were
identified and adjusted in order to eliminate all elements not associated with these assets. 
Future cash flows were measured on the basis of the expected sales by deducting variable and
sales-related imputed costs for the use of contributory assets.  Subsequently,  the outcome was
discounted using the appropriate discount rate and adding a tax amortization benefit. 
- Long-term financial assets: The 'discounted cash flow method" was used for the valuation of a
participation.  Future free cash flows were discounted back to the valuation date using an
appropriate discount rate. 
The excess of the acquisition cost paid versus the net of the amounts of the fair values assigned
to all assets acquired and liabilities assumed,  taking into consideration the respective deferred
taxes,  was recognized as goodwill.  Any acquired asset that did not meet the identification and
recognition criteria for an asset was included in the amount recognized as goodwill. 
Based on the expected cost of sales and operating expenses synergy potential,  the goodwill
arising on this acquisition was allocated to the cash-generating units adidas and Reebok in an
amount of € 699 million and € 466 million,  respectively,  and was converted in functional currencies as appropriate. 
If this acquisition had occurred on January 1,  2006,  total Group net sales would have been
€ 102 billion and net income would have been € 448 million for the year ending December 312006. 
The acquired Reebok subsidiaries contributed € 92 million to the Group's operating profit for
the period from February to December 2006.  Contribution to net income cannot be disclosed due
to the advanced integration of financing and tax activities.

The majority of goodwill which primarily relates to the acquisition of the Reebok business in
2006 is denominated in US dollars.  A negative currency translation effect of € 80 million and
€ 88 million was recorded for the years ending December 31,  2007 and 2006,  respectively. 
From January 1,  2005,  goodwill is tested annually for impairment.  There was no impairment
expense for the years ending December 31,  2007 and 2006.  The Group determines whether
goodwill impairment is necessary at least on an annual basis.  This requires an estimation of
the fair value less costs to sell of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill is allocated. 
Estimating the fair value less costs to sell requires the Group to make an estimate of the
expected future cash flows from the cash-generating unit and also to choose a suitable discount
rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. 
Future changes in expected cash flows and discount rates may lead to impairments of the
accounted goodwill in the future.

At December 31,  2007,  trademarks related to the Reebok acquisition with indefinite useful
lives amounted to € 1285 billion (December 31,  2006: € 1436 billion).  They were estimated to
be indefinite due to the high degree of brand recognition as well as their long standing heritage. 
The trademarks are allocated to the cash-generating unit Reebok. 
The Group determines whether trademarks with indefinite useful life are impaired at least
on an annual basis.  This requires an estimation of the fair value less costs to sell of the cashgenerating units to which the trademark is allocated.  Estimating the fair value less costs to sell
requires the Group to make an estimate of the expected future brand-specific sales and appropriate arm's length royalty rates from the cash-generating unit and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.  There was no impairment
expense for the years ending December 31,  2007 and 2006. 
Future changes in expected cash flows and discount rates may lead to impairments of the
accounted trademarks in the future.

13 LONG-TERM FINANCIAL ASSETS Long-term financial assets include a 10 % investment in
FC Bayern München AG of € 77 million which remains unchanged from when the stake was purchased in July 2002.  This investment is classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value. 
This equity security does not have a quoted market price in an active market,  therefore other
methods of reasonably estimating fair value as at December 31,  2007 were used.  Dividends are
distributed by FC Bayern München AG instead of regular interest payments. 
Additionally,  long-term financial assets include investments which are mainly invested in
insurance products and are measured at fair value,  as well as loans. 
Fair value adjustments from impairment losses amounted to € 4 million and € 8 million for
the years ending December 31,  2007 and 2006,  respectively.  As in the prior year,  these are related to impairments of other financial assets to cover anticipated risks of default.  see also Note 26

15 BORROWINGS AND CREDIT LINES With settlement on October 8,  2003,  adidas issued a
€ 400 million convertible bond through its wholly-owned Dutch subsidiary,  adidas International
Finance B. V.  The bond was guaranteed by adidas AG and issued in tranches of € 50000 each
with a maturity up to 15 years.  The bond is,  at the option of the respective holder,  subject to
certain conditions,  convertible from and including November 18,  2003,  up to and including September 20,  2018,  into ordinary no-par-value bearer shares of adidas AG at the conversion price
of € 2550 which was fixed upon issue.  The coupon of the bond is 25 % and is payable annually in
arrears on October 8 of each year,  commencing on October 8,  2004.  The bond is convertible into
approximately 16 million no-par-value shares. 
The convertible bond is not callable by the issuer until October 2009.  It is callable thereaftersubject to a 130 % trigger between October 2009 and October 2012 and subject to a 115 % trigger
between October 2012 and 2015.  The convertible bond is unconditionally callable thereafter. 
Investors have the right to convert the bond in October 2009,  October 2012 and October 2015. 
The fair values of the liability component and the equity conversion component were determined on the issuance of the bond.  The fair value of the liability component,  included in longterm borrowings,  was calculated using a market interest rate of approximately 46 % for an
equivalent straight bond without conversion rights.  Due to the retrospective application of the
amendment to IAS 39 and IAS 32,  the liability and equity split of the convertible bond changed. 
As a result,  the liability component as at the date of issuance increased by € 711 million with
an equivalent decrease in equity.  The amount of the equity component,  which is included in
equity in the capital reserve,  amounts to € 441 million (less transaction costs of € 09 million). 
The liability component is valued using the 'effective interest method". 
The adidas AG share first traded above 110 % (€ 2805) of the conversion price of € 2550 on
more than 20 trading days within the last 30 trading days in the fourth quarter of 2004.  Consequently,  bond holders have had the right to convert their convertible bonds into equity since
January 1,  2005.  An early redemption or conversion of the convertible bond is currently not
expected. 

Prepaid expenses mainly include prepayments for long-term promotional contracts and service
contracts.  see also Note 31 and Note 22

The actuarial valuations of the defined benefit plans are made at the end of each reporting
period.  The assumptions for employee turnover and mortality are based on empirical data,  the
latter for Germany on the 2005 G version of the mortality tables of Dr.  Heubeck.  The actuarial
assumptions in Germany and in other countries are not materially different. 
As of January 1,  2005,  due to application of the amendment to IAS 19 'Employee Benefits"
issued in December 2004,  the Group recognizes actuarial gains or losses of defined benefit plans
arising during the financial year immediately outside the income statement in the statement
of recognized income and expense.  The actuarial gain recognized in the statement of recognized income and expense for 2007 was € 18 million (2006: € 2 million).  The cumulative recognized actuarial losses amounted to € 12 million (2006: € 30 million).  see also Note 21

Of the total pension expenses,  an amount of € 12 million (2006: € 7 million) relates to employees
in Germany.  Contributions to post-employment benefit plans for employees living in Germany for
the year ending December 31,  2008,  are expected to amount to € 7 million.  The pension expense
is recorded within the operating expenses whereas the production-related part thereof is recognized within the cost of sales. 

The calculations of recognized assets and liabilities from defined benefit plans are based upon
statistical and actuarial calculations.  In particular,  the present value of the defined benefit obligation is impacted by assumptions on discount rates used to arrive at the present value of future
pension liabilities and assumptions on future increases in salaries and benefits.  Furthermorethe Group's independent actuaries use statistically based assumptions covering areas such as
future participant plan withdrawals and estimates on life expectancy.  The actuarial assumptions
used may differ materially from actual results due to changes in market and economic conditions,  higher or lower withdrawal rates,  or longer or shorter life spans of participants and other
changes in the factors being assessed.  These differences could impact the assets or liabilities
recognized in the balance sheet in future periods.

 number of our consolidated companies.  Minority interests are attributable to three subsidiaries as at December 31,  of both 2007 and 2006.  see Shareholdings (Attachment II to these Notes)
These subsidiaries were mainly purchased as part of the acquisition of the Reebok business. 
In accordance with IAS 32,  the following minority interests are not reported within minority
interests: GEV Grundstücksgesellschaft Herzogenaurach mbH & Co.  KG (Germany),  as the company is a limited partnership,  and adidas Hellas A.  E.  (Greece),  as this minority is held with a put
option.  The fair value of these minorities is shown within other liabilities.  The difference between
the fair value and the minority interests is shown as goodwill less accumulated amortization. 
The result for these minorities is reported within financial expenses.

CONVERTIBLE BOND adidas International Finance B. V.  issued a convertible bond with a nominal
value of € 400000000 on October 8,  2003 divided into 8000 convertible bonds with a nominal
value of € 50000 each.  The convertible bond is due for repayment on October 8,  2018,  if not
previously repaid or converted into adidas AG shares.  adidas AG has assumed the unconditional
and irrevocable guarantee with respect to payments of all amounts payable under the convertible bond by adidas International Finance B. V.  for this convertible bond.  Furthermore,  adidas AG
has also taken over the obligation to the holders of the convertible bond to supply shares to be
delivered following conversion of a bond.  The convertible bond entitles the holder to acquire
shares in adidas AG at a conversion price of an original € 102 per share,  whereby the conversion
ratio results from dividing the nominal amount of a bond (€ 50000) by the conversion price ruling at the exercise date.  The conversion price has been meanwhile adjusted to € 2550 following
the stock split undertaken in 2006.  The conversion right can be exercised by a bond holder
between November 18,  2003 and September 20,  2018,  whereby certain conversion restrictions
apply.  When the conversion is exercised,  the shares are to be obtained from contingent capital
established by resolution of the Annual General Meeting of adidas AG on May 8,  2003 in the version of the resolution of the Annual General Meeting held on May 11,  2006.  adidas International
Finance B. V.  is entitled to repay the convertible bond fully on or after October 8,  2009 althoughin the period from October 8,  2009 through October 7,  2015 only to the extent the market value
of the shares of adidas AG amounts to at least 130 % (period from October 8,  2009 through October 7,  2012) or 115 % (period from October 8,  2012 through October 7,  2015) of the conversion
price valid at that time over a certain reference period of time (as set out in the bond conditions). 
The convertible bond was issued as a bearer bond and subscription rights of shareholders to the
bearer bonds were excluded.  The shareholders have no subscription rights per se to the shares
for which the holders of the bonds have rights,  due to security provided by contingent capital. 
There were 7999 bonds outstanding at December 31,  2007 and February 15,  2008,  respectively.

ANNUAL REPORT 2007 -- adidas Group 
182

Due to the short-term maturities of cash and cash equivalents,  accounts receivable and payable
as well as other current receivables and payables their fair values approximate their carrying
amount. 
The fair values of non-current financial assets and liabilities are estimated by discounting
expected future cash flows using current interest rates for debt of similar terms and remaining
maturities. 
Fair values of short-term financial assets measured at 'fair value through profit or loss" and
long-term financial assets classified as available-for-sale are based on quoted market prices in
an active market or are calculated as present values of expected future cash flows. 
The fair values of forward contracts and currency options are determined on the basis of the
market conditions at the reporting dates.  The fair value of a currency option is determined using
generally accepted models to calculate option prices.  The fair market value of an option is influenced not only by the remaining term of the option but also by further determining factors,  such
as the actual foreign exchange rate and the volatility of the underlying foreign currency base. 
The fair values of interest rate options at the reporting date are assessed by generally accepted
models,  such as the 'Markov functional model". 

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR THE HEDGING OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK The adidas Group
uses natural hedges and arranges forward contracts,  currency options and currency swaps to
protect against foreign exchange risk.  In 2007,  the Group contracted currency options with
premiums paid totaling of € 7 million (2006: € 11 million).  The effective part of the currency
hedges is directly recognized in hedging reserves and the acquisition costs of secured inventories,  respectively,  and posted into the income statement at the same time as the underlying
secured transaction is recorded.  An amount of negative € 10 million (2006: € 0 million) for currency options and an amount of negative € 51 million (2006: negative € 22 million) for forward
contracts were recorded in hedging reserves.  A total amount of € 12 million impacted net
income in 2007 (2006: € 27 million). 
The time value of the currency options not being part of the hedge in an amount of negative
€ 9 million (2006: negative € 9 million) was recorded in the income statement in 2007. 
The total net amount of US dollar purchases versus other currencies was US $ 30 billion
and US $ 32 billion in the years ending December 31,  2007 and 2006,  respectively. 
The notional amounts of all outstanding currency hedging instruments,  which are mainly
related to cash flow hedges,  are summarized in the following table:

The comparatively high amount of forward contracts is primarily due to currency swaps for
liquidity management purposes and hedging transactions. 

Net gains or losses on financial assets or financial liabilities held for trading include the effects
from fair value measurements of the derivatives that are not part of a hedging relationship,  and
changes in the fair value of other financial instruments as well as interest payments which
mainly relate to investment funds. 
Net gains or losses on loans and receivables comprise mainly impairment losses and reversals. 
Net gains or losses on financial liabilities measured at amortized cost include effects from
early settlement and reversals of accrued liabilities.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR THE HEDGING OF INTEREST RATE RISK In the last two years
the Group has switched concentration from short-term financing to long-term financing,  due to
increasing interest rates.  As a result,  the Group is better protected against rising interest rates. 
As in 2006,  no additional interest rate caps were entered into in 2007 and remaining maturing
interest rate caps amounting to approximately € 50 million were not renewed.  There were no
interest rate swaps entered into in 2007. 
Interest rate hedges which were outstanding as at December 31,  2007 and 2006,  respectively
expire as detailed below:

 total negative net fair value of € 61 million (2006: negative € 22 million) for forward contracts
related to hedging instruments falling under hedge accounting as per definition of IAS 39 was
recorded in hedging reserve.  The remaining net negative fair value of € 7 million (2006: positive
€ 3 million) mainly related to liquidity swaps for cash management purposes was recorded in
the income statement.  The total fair value of outstanding currency options related to cash flow
hedges. 
The fair value adjustments of outstanding cash flow hedges for forecasted sales will be
reported in the income statement when the forecasted sales transactions are recorded.  The vast
majority of these transactions are forecasted to occur in 2008.  Inventories were adjusted by
€ 22 million as at December 31,  2007,  which will be recognized in the income statement in 2008. 
In hedging reserves,  an amount of negative € 3 million is included for hedges of net investments in foreign entities.  This reserve will remain until the investment in the foreign entity is
divested. 
In order to determine the fair values of its derivatives that are not publicly traded,  the adidas
Group uses generally accepted finance-related economic models based on market conditions
prevailing at the balance sheet date. 

The above summary for 2007 includes the notional amount of one long-term US dollar interest
rate swap in an amount of € 68 million (2006: € 76 million),  two long-term cross-currency swaps
for an amount of € 33 million (2006: € 29 million) and three interest rate swaps for a total of
€ 279 million (2006: € 279 million).  Both cross-currency swaps and the one long-term US dollar
interest rate swap are classified as fair value hedges,  while the three interest rate swaps are
classified as cash flow hedges. 
The interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps had a negative fair value of
€ 10 million (2006: negative € 12 million) and a positive fair value of € 4 million (2006: € 3 million) as at December 31,  2007. 
The risks hedged with fair value hedges occur from financing with private placements in
US dollars,  Japanese yen and Australian dollars amounting to a notional equivalent of € 101 million (2006: € 105 million).  The aim of cross-currency swap hedges in Australian dollars and
Japanese yen was to turn the financing into euro and retain the financing method.  The intent of
the US dollar interest rate swap was to obtain variable financing.  The total negative € 7 million
fair value (2006: negative € 2 million),  which was recorded directly in the income statement as
incurred,  was compensated by positive fair value effects of the hedged items in an amount of
€ 6 million (2006: € 12 million). 
All euro-denominated interest rate swaps qualify as cash flow hedges pursuant to IAS 39. 
They relate to euro private placements with variable interest rates for a notional amount of € 279
million (2006: € 279 million).  The goal of these hedges is to lower exposure to increasing shortterm euro interest rates.  The negative fair value of € 1 million (2006: € 4 million) was credited in
hedging reserves.

working budget consists of promotion and communication spending such as promotion contracts,  advertising,  retail support,  events and other communication activities.  However,  it does
not include marketing overhead expenses.  In 2007,  marketing working budget accounted for
approximately 34 % (2006: 35 %) of the total operating expenses. 
Total depreciation and amortization expense for tangible and intangible assets (excluding
goodwill) was € 211 million and € 209 million for the years ending December 31,  2007 and 2006respectively.  Thereof,  € 7 million and € 16 million were recorded within the cost of sales as they
are directly attributable to the production costs of goods sold.

Interest income from financial instruments,  measured at amortized cost,  mainly consists of
interest income from bank deposits and loans. 
Interest income / expense from financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss
mainly includes interest payments from investment funds as well as net interest payments from
interest derivatives not being part of a hedging relationship.  Unrealized gains / losses from fair
value measurement of such financial assets are shown in other financial income or expenses. 
Interest expense on financial instruments measured at amortized cost mainly includes interest on borrowings and effects from using the effective interest method. 
Interest expense on provisions and non-financial liabilities particularly includes effects from
measurement of provisions at present value and interest on non-financial liabilities such as tax
payables. 
Other financial expenses include impairment losses on other financial assets amounting to
€ 4 million and € 8 million for the years ending December 31,  2007 and 2006,  respectively.  Also
included in other financial expenses are minority interests,  which are not recorded in equity
according to IAS 32.

27 INCOME TAXES adidas AG and its German subsidiaries are subject to German corporate
and trade taxes. 
For the years ending December 31,  2007 and 2006,  the statutory corporate income tax rate of
25 % plus a surcharge of 55 % thereon is applied to earnings.  The municipal trade tax is approximately 15 % of taxable income,  which is deductible in the determination of income for corporation tax purposes.  The tax rate reduction due to the German Tax Reform 2008 was taken into
account for the calculation of the deferred tax assets and liabilities of the German companies in
2007. 
For non-German companies,  deferred taxes are calculated based on tax rates that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the closing date.

The Group does not recognize deferred tax liabilities for unremitted earnings of non-German
subsidiaries to the extent that they are expected to be permanently invested in international
operations.  These earnings,  the amount of which cannot be practicably computed,  could become
subject to additional tax if they were remitted as dividends or if the Group were to sell its shareholdings in the subsidiaries.

The effective tax rate of the Group differs from an assumed tax rate of 40 % as follows:
TAX RATE RECONCILIATION

As a result of the acquisition of Reebok International Ltd.  (USA) and its subsidiaries in 2006 that
was accounted for under the purchase method see Note 4,  deferred tax liabilities were recorded
as the difference between the carrying amount and the tax basis of acquired assets. 
Group deferred tax assets recognized for actual existing and unused accumulated tax loss
carry-forwards amounted to € 203 million for the year ending December 31,  2007 and mainly
relate to the US tax group. 
Deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that the realization of the related benefit is probable.  Valuation allowances are established where this criterion is not met,  based on the
past performance and the prospects of the respective business for the foreseeable future. 
Valuation allowances,  which relate to deferred tax assets of companies whose realization of
the related tax benefits is not probable,  increased on a currency-neutral basis by € 4 million to
€ 71 million for the year ending December 31,  2007.  These amounts mainly relate to unused
foreign tax credits of the US tax group,  which expire in a relatively short period and cannot be
carried forward indefinitely.  Remaining valuation allowances relate to deferred tax assets of
companies operating in certain emerging markets,  since the realization of the related benefit is
not considered probable.

For 2006,  other non-deductible expenses include a tax benefit of € 21 million related to the
favorable resolution of international tax disputes for prior years. 
In 2007,  tax rate changes reflect changes enacted in German and non-German tax rates
which were utilized for the calculation of the deferred tax assets and liabilities.  The total change
relates mainly to a UK tax rate reduction effective in 2008. 

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Notes to the Consolidated Income Statement  Notes Additional Information 
ANNUAL REPORT 2007 -- adidas Group 
28 EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net income
attributable to shareholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the
year. 
Dilutive potential shares arose under the Management Share Option Plan (MSOP) of adidas
AG,  which was implemented in 1999 see Note 32.  As the required performance criteria for the exercise of the stock options of all tranches of the share option plan have been fulfilled,  dilutive
potential shares impact the diluted earnings per share calculation. 
It is also necessary to include dilutive potential shares arising from the convertible bond
issuance in October 2003 in the calculation of diluted earnings per share as at December 312007 and 2006,  respectively,  as the required conversion criteria were fulfilled at the balance
sheet date see Note 15.  As a result,  the convertible bond is assumed to have been converted into
ordinary shares and the net income is adjusted to eliminate the interest expense less the tax
effect.

NOTES ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

29 SEGMENTAL INFORMATION The Group operates predominately in one industry segment –
the design,  wholesale and marketing of athletic and sports lifestyle products.  The Group is currently managed by brands. 
Certain Group functions are centralized and an allocation of these functions to specific
segments is not considered to be meaningful.  This includes functions such as central treasuryworldwide sourcing as well as other headquarter departments.  Assets,  liabilities,  income and
expenses relating to these corporate functions are presented in the HQ / Consolidation column
together with other non-allocable items and intersegment eliminations. 
The Reebok segment includes the brands Reebok,  Reebok-CCM Hockey and Rockport.  The
Greg Norman license,  which was acquired with the Reebok business and subsequently sold in
November 2006,  was allocated to the TaylorMade-adidas Golf segment.  In 2007,  the remaining
retail activities were allocated to the Reebok segment.  Both the NBA and Liverpool licensed
businesses were transferred to brand adidas in the first half of 2006. 
Information about the Group's segments in accordance with the management approach is
presented on the following page. 
There are no intersegment sales between the brands.  Net sales to third parties are shown in
the geographic market in which the revenues are realized.  The global sourcing function is included in the HQ / Consolidation column.  Transactions between the segments are based on the
dealing-at-arm's-length principle. 
Segment assets include all operating assets and comprise mainly accounts receivableinventory as well as property,  plant and equipment and intangible assets.  Segment liabilities
comprise operating liabilities and consist principally of trade and other payables as well as
accrued liabilities and provisions.  Non-allocable items including financial assets or assets and
liabilities relating to income taxes and borrowings,  are included in the HQ / Consolidation
column. 
Capital expenditure,  amortization and depreciation relate to segment assets; the acquisition
of goodwill and the inception of finance leases do not affect capital expenditure.

Tranche V (2003)

1) Due to the share split effective May 2006,  one option is equivalent to four shares. 

The remaining contractual lives for stock options outstanding at the end of the period are
presented as follows: Tranche III (2001) until July 2008,  Tranche IV (2002) until July 2009 and
Tranche V (2003) until July 2010. 
For stock options outstanding at the end of the period it is not possible to disclose the range
of exercise prices because they are dependent on future share price development. 
No stock options were issued during the year under review. 
Stock options may only be exercised subject to the attainment of at least one of the following
performance objectives:
- (1) Absolute Performance: During the period between the issuance and exercise of the stock
options,  the stock market price for the adidas AG share calculated upon the basis of the total
shareholder return approach has increased by an annual average rate of at least 8 %. 

The stock options may only be exercised against payment of the exercise price.  The exercise
price corresponds to the arithmetical mean of the closing price of the adidas AG share over the
last 20 trading days of the respective exercise period,  less a discount,  based on the extent to
which the share price at exercise exceeded the absolute and relative performance hurdles outlined above.  In every case,  the exercise price shall be at least the lowest issue price as stated in
§ 9 section 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG),  currently € 100 (i, e.  € 400 per option). 
Option terms and conditions stipulate that the stock options may be used for existing common shares in lieu of new shares from the contingent capital,  or in the place of common shares
the discount is paid in cash. 
The new shares participate in profits from the beginning of the year in which they are issued. 

- (2) Relative Performance: During the same period,  the stock market price for the adidas AG
share must have developed by an annual average of 1 % more favorably than the stock market
prices of a basket of global competitors of the adidas Group and in absolute terms may not have
fallen.

GLOSSARY
AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPT (ADR) US-traded negotiable certificate of a foreign-based
company held by a US bank that entitles the holder to all dividends and rights of the underlying
stock.  ADRs provide a way for Americans to invest in foreign-based companies by buying their
shares in the USA instead of through an overseas exchange. 
ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES (ABS) Securities (bonds or notes) backed by loan receivablesaccounts receivable or other quantifiable assets. 
ASSET COVERAGE I & II The extent to which a company's non-current assets cover its debt
obligations.  They are expressed as a percentage and calculated as follows:
Asset coverage I (%)  (equity + non-current liabilities) / non-current assets. 
Asset coverage II (%)  (equity + non-current liabilities) / (non-current assets + inventories). 
ATHLETIC SPECIALTY A largely mall-based retail distribution concept in North America that
focuses primarily on selling sports and sports lifestyle products to consumers. 
BACKLOGS Also called order backlogs.  The value of orders received for future delivery.  At adidas
and Reebok,  most orders are received six to nine months in advance,  depending on the season. 
This information is used as an indicator of future sales performance. 
BASIC EARNINGS PER SHARE (BASIC EPS) Performance indicator used to gauge a company's
earnings per share,  based on the number of shares outstanding (excluding stock options,  as well
as options and conversion rights related to a convertible bond). 
Basic EPS  net income / weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. 

CLASSICS Products designed in an authentic heritage style,  targeting sports lifestyle consumers
who seek trendsetting streetwear with authentic origins. 
CLEARANCE SALES Revenues generated outside the course of normal business terms,  arising
from commercial decisions by management to clear excess stock usually through specific
channels and at a significant discount. 
CLIMA adidas apparel system encompassing the ClimaCool®,  ClimaLite®,  ClimaWarm® and
ClimaProof® technologies.  ClimaCool® is an integrated system of technologies that work
together to regulate the athlete's body temperature.  ClimaCool® is also utilized as a cooling
system in footwear.  ClimaLite® fabric pulls sweat away from the skin to the outer fabric face for
quick evaporation,  enhancing the body's natural temperature regulation.  ClimaWarm® is lightweight,  breathable insulation that keeps the athlete dry and comfortable in cold weather conditions.  ClimaProof® is breathable weather protection that keeps wind,  rain and snow out while
allowing heat and sweat to escape through evaporation. 
CO-BRANDED STORES adidas or Reebok stores that are co-branded together with a partner,  for
example a sports league such as the NHL or NBA (e.  g.  NBA Concept Shop in Istanbul,  Turkey). 
COMMERCIAL PAPER Tradable unsecured promissory notes issued for the purpose of shortterm financing.  A commercial paper is issued on an ongoing,  revolving basis with maturities
typically between seven days and 12 months or more. 
CONCESSION CORNERS Retail space that is fully operated by one brand within the adidas Group. 
This distribution channel mainly exists in Asian markets,  where no other established channels of
distribution exist.

BETA FACTOR Indicates a stock's relative risk.  A beta coefficient of more than one indicates that
the stock has a higher risk than the overall market.  Conversely,  a beta coefficient of less than
one indicates a lower risk. 

CONVERTIBLE BOND Corporate bond that can be exchanged for a specific number of shares
of a company's common stock.  Convertible bonds tend to have lower interest rates than nonconvertibles because they also accrue value as the price of the underlying stock rises.  In this
way,  convertible bonds reflect a combination of the benefits of stocks and those of bonds. 

BODY MAPPING Aligning Clima fabric and construction technologies with an athlete's physiological zones of heat and sweat production,  to optimize dryness and thermal comfort during
sport. 

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Distribution of rights and responsibilities among the primary stakeholders in a company,  in particular shareholders,  the Executive Board and the Supervisory
