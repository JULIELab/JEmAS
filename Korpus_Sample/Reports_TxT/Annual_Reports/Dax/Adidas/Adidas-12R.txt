Letter to the Shareholders
10 PASSION FOR SPORT

DEAR SHAREHOLDERS2002 was another great year for adidas-Salomon: Our brands grew stronger and became
more visible,  we successfully introduced exciting new products and we delivered excellent
operational and financial performance.  And all of this was achieved in a tough competitive
and economic environment. 
Our brands got terrific exposure as we dominated the world's two major sporting events
in 2002.  At the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City both Salomon and adidas were everywhere.  Together,  we sponsored more than 50% of all athletes,  who won nearly 200 medals. 
And at the FIFA World Cup 2002TM in Korea and Japan,  adidas scored another big victory. 
Market research showed that adidas was undoubtedly the most visible brand at the world's
largest sporting event,  estimated to have been seen by 44 billion cumulative viewers over
the course of the tournament. 
In our adidas Sport Performance division,  we launched two major footwear innovations: a3® and ClimaCool®.  Both greatly exceeded our internal expectations.  We sold more
than one million pairs of ClimaCool® and 500000 pairs of a3®.  In basketball,  the T-MAC
and the T-MAC 2 both became best-selling shoes in the USA something no adidas shoe
had done in six years. 

Herbert Hainer,  48 /// Chairman and Chief Executive Officer / German
Sport and business are basically the same.  To win,  you have to
have the right team,  passion for what you do and the commitment
to never take your eye off the ball. 

11

adidas Sport Heritage continued to grow at strong double-digit rates and is now a more
than € 900 million business.  In the last two years,  we have nearly doubled sales in this
division,  with trend-setters and style leaders around the world wearing our products. 
Our newest adidas division,  Sport Style,  got off to a powerful start at the Paris Fashion
Week in October.  Media,  retailers and spectators strongly praised our unique cooperation
with designer Yohji Yamamoto.  Consumers can buy these products this spring,  when they
are launched at exclusive fashion boutiques around the world. 
At TaylorMade,  we also received a strong reception from golfers for our revolutionary
new metalwoods the R500 Series.  This is already the number one played driver on the
US,  European and Japanese professional golf tours.  As a result of this success,  TaylorMade
is now the global leader in metalwood sales.  And our acquisition of the Maxfli golf ball
brand has further strengthened our golfing product range. 
Salomon continues as the number one winter sports brand,  despite two seasons of
tough snow conditions.  More importantly,  it is expanding into the all-important soft goods
category,  both with its own products and the newly acquired Arc'Teryx brand. 

Glenn Bennett,  39 /// Global Operations / American
To succeed in competition,  you need speed,  power
and agility.  That's the focus of Global Operations within
the adidas-Salomon Group. 

12 PASSION FOR SPORT LETTER TO THE SHAREHOLDERS

Our regions also delivered excellent performance.  Spurred by the World Cup,  sales in
Asia grew by more than 20% on a currency-neutral basis with Japan,  Korea and China
being the key drivers.  In North America,  our new approach to the market is producing
results and our turnaround is in full swing.  In local currency,  sales grew by 14% and yearend backlogs showed their highest rates since 1998.  In Europe,  our biggest region,  we
increased sales by another 4% despite especially tough conditions in our home market
Germany.  Standouts here were Italy and the UK.  In Latin America,  currency-neutral sales
grew more than 30%.  In euro terms,  however,  this positive development was undercut by
massive currency devaluation in Argentina and Brazil. 
We continued to align our marketing and operations activities more closely.  We now
have dedicated teams for all areas of our business: adidas Sport Performance,  adidas Sport
Heritage,  adidas Sport Style,  Salomon and TaylorMade-adidas Golf.  In addition,  we made
major headway in further increasing speed to market,  including taking 30 days out of the
footwear production process. 
Our work on social and environmental issues was widely acknowledged by stakeholders,  non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and other independent institutes.  We
were again rated as a leader in our industry by the Dow Jones Sustainability Group
Index and the FTSE4Good Europe Index. 

Ross McMullin,  47 /// North America / Canadian
In business as in sport,  strong leadership and outstanding
teamwork are critical for success. 

Manfred Ihle,  61 /// Legal and Environmental Affairs / German
The true sportsman knows that winning is only sweet when the
victory is achieved fairly and honestly. 

13

All of our efforts have paid off in superior financial performance.  Sales in 2002 grew by
7% to € 65 billion,  with currency-neutral double-digit increases coming from both North
America and Asia.  We surpassed our gross margin target range,  with a strong 432% of
sales.  We improved working capital as a percentage of sales.  We drove down debt by more
than € 180 million.  And most importantly,  we increased bottom-line earnings by 10%. 
Our successes are being widely recognized.  Consumers,  retailers and investors all see us
in a different,  much more positive light today than they have in several years.  To give one
example: for the second year in a row our share was the best performing stock in the
German blue-chip index DAX-30.  This is a feat which no other German company has ever
matched. 
While we have done many things right in 2002,  it's now time for us to go even further. 
We have a clear vision: passion for sport.  And we have a clear mission: to be the global
leader in the sporting goods industry.  In 2003,  we expect to grow sales and profitability in
all regions.  Our targets are revenue growth of around 5% and earnings growth of between
10 and 15%. 

Michel Perraudin,  55 /// Human ResourcesKey Projects and Corporate Services / Swiss
At adidas-Salomon,  what makes us unique is our
attitude we are committed to working together
as a team. 

14 PASSION FOR SPORT LETTER TO THE SHAREHOLDERS

We aim to reach a 20% share of the US footwear business in the next three to five
years.  We plan to expand our Group's leading position in Europe.  And we are striving for
leadership in Asia.  Of course,  there are uncertainties both large and small which will
always challenge us,  but the success of the past three years gives me great confidence that
our Group can meet the high expectations we've set for ourselves. 
Before I close,  I want to thank all of the adidas-Salomon employees for their dedication
and commitment over the last year.  Winning is a team effort,  and I am convinced that we
have just the right people in place to take our Group to the next level of performance. 
My thanks also to you,  our shareholders,  for the trust you continue to place in our
Management team. 
Today,  adidas-Salomon is a much better,  leaner and fitter organization.  We have successfully repositioned ourselves in the marketplace,  and have grown faster than many of our
competitors.  This is a long and tough race but each of us at adidas-Salomon is passionate
about winning it. 

Herbert Hainer
Chairman,  Chief Executive Officer

Robin Stalker,  44 /// Finance / New Zealander
Winning takes more than having a goal.  It's about creating
the right game plan and then finding the optimal balance
between the big picture and the details. 

Erich Stamminger,  45 /// Global Marketing / German
Our individual and collective passion for sport drives the
whole Group forward.  It always has and it always will.

TOP PERFORMER IN DAX-30 /// In 2002,  stock markets
worldwide were characterized by significant share price
decreases.  Within this very difficult environment,  the
adidas-Salomon share also declined 2%,  but nevertheless outperformed most of our competitors.  Ending the
year at € 8230,  the adidas-Salomon share was the top
performer in the DAX-30,  Germany's premiere stock
index,  which declined 44% in 2002.  Outperforming the
index by 42 percentage points,  this marked the first time
in the history of the index that one of its members was
the top performer for two consecutive years.  In additionadidas-Salomon's share price development also beat the
Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) World
Textiles,  Apparel and Luxury Goods index,  which comprises the Group's major competitors.  This index lost
8% in the course of the year. 

SHARE PRICE STABLE IN VOLATILE MARKETS /// After
strong 2001 share price performance (+28%),  profittaking characterized the adidas-Salomon share price
development at the beginning of 2002.  Share price
improvements in March through May were driven by
strong retailer and consumer response to the Group's
new technologies as well as short-lived indicators of
improving US consumer confidence.  As a result,  the
share price reached a 33-month high at the end of May. 
However,  accounting scandals in the USA and Germanyas well as disappointing quarterly results within the
sporting goods industry,  led to investor skepticism
towards the stock market in general and the industry
in particular.  This resulted in a dip in the stock price in
June and July.  These declines were partially offset by
increases at the beginning of August,  which were mainly
due to strong second quarter results released by adidasSalomon.  Profit warnings from competitors and athletic
specialty retailers in the USA as well as the shutdown
of the ports on the US West Coast and concerns about
possible military action in Iraq put further pressure on
the stock markets.  This led to substantial deterioration
of all leading indicators as well as the adidas-Salomon
share.  In October,  we experienced the year-low share
price at € 6428.  In the last two months of the year,  the
share price grew strongly.  Positive third quarter results
as well as an interest rate reduction in Europe and
continued appreciation of the euro all helped drive our
share price to € 8230 on December 30. 

HIGH TRADING ACTIVITY CONTINUES /// In 2002about 78 million adidas-Salomon shares were traded
on German stock exchanges including the electronic
trading system Xetra.  The average daily trading volume
was 307000 shares.  To increase overall trading efficiency
and in response to the low trading volume in Paris,  we
decided to discontinue our Euronext listing.  Effective
March 19,  2003,  the adidas-Salomon share will be
traded exclusively on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange
and the other eight regional exchanges in Germany. 
adidas-Salomon also has an unsponsored ADR program
in the USA according to Rule 144A,  which is limited to
qualified institutional investors. 

WEEKLY SHARE PRICE DEVELOPMENT1)

MEMBERSHIP IN HIGH-QUALITY INDICES /// The adidasSalomon share is included in a variety of indices which
act as indicators for the development of the respective
markets and regions.  Most importantly,  as one of the
30 largest exchange-listed companies in Germany,  our
share is included in the DAX-30,  Germany's premiere
stock index.  At the end of 2002,  our share was ranked
number 18 and 21 in the DAX-30 respectively,  as reported
by Deutsche Börse,  according to the two key criteriamarket capitalization and 12-month average turnover. 
Our share is also a member of the Dow Jones STOXX the Dow Jones EURO STOXX and the MSCI World index as
well as their corresponding sector indices.  This shows
that adidas-Salomon is represented in high-quality
indices around the world.  In addition,  the adidasSalomon share is also included in the Dow Jones
Sustainability Group Index and the FTSE4Good Europe
Index.  This is evidence of our successful efforts to combine strong financial performance with the commitment
to environmental sustainability,  a positive relationship
with our stakeholders and dedication to supporting
human rights (see Sustainability).

EXTENSIVE AND POSITIVE ANALYST COVERAGE /// The
relevance of our Group within the financial community
is also reflected in the extensive coverage of adidasSalomon by numerous financial institutions.  In 2002more than 35 banks released research reports on
adidas-Salomon on a regular basis.  Within the last three
months of the year,  more than half of these analysts
(52%) had issued a 'buy" recommendation for our share. 
Only 8% ranked our share in the 'sell" category,  while
40% recommended investors 'hold" our share. 
€ 100 DIVIDEND AT TOP END OF GROUP DIVIDEND
RANGE /// After paying a dividend of € 092 per share
in each of the last three years,  the adidas-Salomon
Executive and Supervisory Boards will recommend a
dividend of € 100 for the 2002 fiscal year to our shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on May 8,  2003. 
This increase of 9% versus the prior years amounts to the
highest dividend in the Group's history and reflects our
philosophy to share our Group's success with our shareholders.  With a total payout of approximately € 45 million
the proposal represents a payout percentage of 20%. 
This is at the top end of our dividend policy,  which
recommends a payout ratio of between 15 and 20% of
consolidated net income. 

26 THE GROUP OUR SHARE

PROPORTION OF INTERNATIONAL SHAREHOLDERS
GROWS IN 2002 /// Continuing the development of recent
years,  adidas-Salomon's shareholder structure showed
 clear trend towards an increasingly international
shareholder base in 2002.  The amount of invitations
to our Annual General Meeting in May 2002 distributed
on our behalf by banks indicates a total number of
around 95000 shareholders.  adidas-Salomon has a free
float of 100%. 
According to estimates based on our latest annual
ownership analysis conducted in June 2002,  institutional
investors currently account for 76% of the Group's 454
million outstanding shares (2001: 69%).  Smaller,  undisclosed holdings,  which mainly include retail investorsmake up 19% of adidas-Salomon's shares (2001: 21%). 
Of the known institutional investors,  North Americans
continue to be the largest group.  Their share ownership
increased to 31% in 2002 from 27% in 2001.  German
institutional investors account for 19% of outstanding
shares versus 16% in the prior year.  Other Europeans now
hold 22% of adidas-Salomon's shares compared to 24% in
2001.  Holdings of other international shareholders have
doubled to 4% in 2002 from 2% in 2001.  adidas-Salomon
Management,  which includes current members of the
Executive and Supervisory Boards,  holds less than 5% of
outstanding shares.  This compares to less than 10% in
2001. 

INVESTOR RELATIONS ACTIVITIES INCREASE /// At
adidas-Salomon,  we constantly strive to further improve
communication with both individual and institutional
investors.  In the course of 2002,  adidas-Salomon's
Management and the Investor Relations team visited a
large number of investors during road shows in EuropeNorth America and Asia.  In addition,  we frequently
participated in conferences,  spoke at retail investor
presentations,  held over 400 one-on-one meetings with
institutional investors and also met with shareholders'
representatives on several occasions.  In September
2002,  we hosted our third annual Investor Day in London
which included presentations from five Executive Board
members.  By presenting the latest product innovations
as well as Management's goals and strategies to
investors and financial analysts,  we continue to increase
adidas-Salomon's visibility within the financial community.  This supports our efforts to achieve a fair valuation
of the adidas-Salomon share on the stock markets.

Our Strategy /// THE adidas-Salomon STRATEGY IS FOCUSED ON CONTINUOUSLY DEVELOPING
AND STRENGTHENING OUR BRANDS.  WE AIM TO MAXIMIZE OUR BRANDS' IMPACT WITH CONSUMERS
AND ENHANCE BRAND PROFITABILITY ON THE BASIS OF FIVE STRATEGIC PILLARS THAT GUIDE
EVERYTHING WE DO. 

Group Strategy
30 STRATEGY

CONSUMER-ORIENTED STRUCTURE /// We believe that one of our competitive advantages
is in structuring our organization in a way that unites our brand values with the needs and
demands of our consumers.  This is a deliberate move away from the traditional industry
approach along footwear,  apparel and hardware lines.  We have already structured the
entire marketing and operations activities in this way.  Our next priority is to extend this
model to our global sales function,  and at the same time to increase our consumer research
to continually expand our knowledge about our primary target groups. 
DESIGN AND INNOVATION LEADERSHIP /// Consumer buying and brand perception in
the sporting goods sector are intrinsically linked to cutting-edge design coupled with
market-leading,  visible technologies that are easy to understand.  At adidas-Salomon,  we
are committed to keeping our product pipeline full with new,  close-to-market design and
technologies.  We plan to launch at least one major new technology or technological
evolution per year to excite consumers and demonstrate our continued commitment to
market innovation. 
DEVELOP LEADING POSITIONS IN ALL OUR MAJOR MARKETS AND CATEGORIES /// We
are in the business to win.  We strive to have number one or number two positions in all the
markets and categories that we compete in.  On a regional basis,  our efforts start in our
home market Europe,  where we are seeking to extend our leadership position with our
'Winning in Europe" program to drive both top- and bottom-line growth in the coming
years.  In North America,  our first goal is to achieve an undisputed number two position. 
With a footwear market share of 20% in the next three to five years.  In Asia,  we are striving
to become the market leader with top positions in the region's major markets.  And in Latin
America,  our goal is to be the fastest growing sporting goods supplier for the next five
years. 

EXCELLENCE IN EXECUTION /// Superior products and marketing are vital to success in
our industry,  but sales are often made on the basis of who consistently delivers on timeensures best quality and is willing to go the extra mile for retail partners.  These are areas
where our industry has a long way to go versus other industries,  and for adidas-Salomon
we are placing a high priority on executional exellence.  Our efforts to shorten and customize the global supply chain,  to ensure best-practice social and environmental standards
and ongoing commitment to customer service are just a few examples of our progress in
this area. 
FOCUS ON FINANCIAL HEALTH /// Our Group knows that while top- and bottom-line growth
is critical to our goal to be the global leader in the sporting goods industry,  performance
also needs to be measured by other criteria.  The indicators of financial health that are
highest priorities for us include operating margin,  working capital as a percentage of sales
and debt reduction.  We intend to make visible improvements to the operating margin for
each of the next three years.  Working capital as a percentage of sales should continue to
decrease annually during the same period.  And with respect to financial leverage,  our goal
is to reduce the Group's debt by at least € 100 million per year.

adidas /// AT adidas,  OUR ORGANIZATION IS MATCHED TO THE NEEDS OF THREE
GROUPS OF SPORT-ORIENTED CONSUMERS: > OUR SPORT PERFORMANCE DIVISION IS
AIMED AT ATHLETES AT ALL PERFORMANCE LEVELS,  > SPORT HERITAGE TARGETS
TREND-SETTERS SEEKING SPORT-INSPIRED STREETWEAR WITH AN AUTHENTIC
ORIGIN,  > AND SPORT STYLE FOCUSES ON YOUNG COSMOPOLITAN CONSUMERS
LOOKING FOR EXCLUSIVE,  FASHION-ORIENTED SPORTSWEAR PRODUCTS.  THIS
THREE-DIVISIONAL APPROACH HELPS US TO BEST DEVELOP AND MARKET INNOVATIVE
PRODUCTS,  MEETING THE NEEDS OF TODAY'S DIVERSE CONSUMERS. 

adidas SPORT PERFORMANCE /// adidas Sport Performance focuses on offering functional
and exciting products in all our sports categories.  Our top five priorities are runningfootball,  basketball,  tennis and training.  We have number one or two positions globally in
all of these categories. 
MAJOR INITIATIVES IN RUNNING /// Running is the world's largest footwear category
and an area where adidas has always been strong.  We strive to be the leader in designinnovation,  performance and,  ultimately,  in volume.  Our product pipeline is based on two
strong product families: ClimaCool® and a3®.  ClimaCool® is our 360° ventilated footwear
and apparel,  where we plan to sell more than two million pairs of footwear and two million
pieces of apparel in 2003.  a3®,  our revolutionary energy management footwear technologyis being expanded into new variations to come closer to meeting the needs of individual
athletes.  We will support these innovations and the rest of our strong running offering
with high-impact marketing around the world including marathons in Boston,  LondonBerlin,  Paris,  Milan and Amsterdam.  Other important running initiatives include tailored
solutions for our key accounts and athletic specialty retail partners,  and our industryleading,  made-to-measure 'mi adidas" customized footwear program. 
BASKETBALL SUCCESS CONTINUES /// Basketball is the fastest growing category in the
USA and is key to future growth prospects in the region.  In the last two years,  we have
nearly doubled the size of our basketball business.  In addition to utilizing our ClimaCool®
and a3® technologies,  powerful basketball symbols such as Tracy McGrady and Tim Duncan
are helping to propel product interest and sales.  In November,  we will release our T-MAC 3
as the next follow-up to our hugely successful Tracy McGrady-inspired basketball shoes. 

adidas /// PREDATOR ® MANIA
FOOTBALL BOOT

Brand Strategies
56 STRATEGY

FOCUS ON FOOTBALL /// The 2002 FIFA World Cup™ reconfirmed our leadership in football.  Our Predator® Mania football boot is recognized as the highest-caliber football product
in the world.  Our sponsorship of such teams as Bayern Munich,  Real Madrid,  AC MilanAjax Amsterdam or players such as David Beckham and Zinedine Zidane shows our skill in
selecting key partners.  We will be the dominant brand at the most prominent football
events of the next several years: the UEFA Champions League™,  the 2003 FIFA Women's
World Cup™ in China and the European Championships in Portugal in 2004.  And,  we are
already preparing for the next World Cup in Germany in 2006. 
TENNIS LEADERSHIP DRIVEN BY PRODUCT EXCELLENCE /// adidas is the world leader in
performance tennis footwear and apparel.  Creating performance products that set the
industry standard is adidas' trademark in the category.  Supporting adidas' leading market
position is a strong portfolio of young players including Marat Safin and Anna Kournikovaas well as our sponsorship of important events such as the Grand Slam tournament
Roland Garros. 

adidas COLOURS TO BRING EXCITEMENT TO SPORT PERFORMANCE APPAREL /// Training
apparel is a market segment that has been under pressure in the last few years as fashion
suppliers,  vertical retailers,  licensed athletic apparel and generic products have all become
important competitive elements in the market.  Previously,  this market had been dominated
only by sporting goods companies.  adidas Colours,  our new strongly-branded apparel linewill be introduced to retail on a bi-monthly basis in 2003.  It will be supported by our largest
print and outdoor advertising campaign ever. 
adidas SPORT HERITAGE SALES TO SURPASS € 1 BILLION IN 2003 /// The adidas Sport
Heritage division targets sports lifestyle consumers who seek trend-setting streetwear with
authentic origins.  This division started in 2000 with less than € 500 million in sales,  and has
been the fastest growing area of the adidas business over the last two years.  Sport Heritage
concept stores in exciting locations such as New York,  Berlin and Tokyo are helping us to
position these products directly with key sports lifestyle consumers.  In 2003,  we are targeting sales of € 1 billion with product focusing on our brand's unique heritage in sports such
as football,  Olympic sports,  tennis and basketball. 
adidas SPORT STYLE HITS THE MARKET IN 2003 /// The adidas Sport Style division is
bringing a new line of products to the market in 2003.  Our Y-3 collection,  developed with
designer Yohji Yamamoto,  is helping us extend our product appeal to young cosmopolitan
consumers who are looking for exclusive,  style-leading active sportswear products. 
Yamamoto's strong presence in this area allows us to expand the power of the adidas
brand.  In the first season,  distribution is limited to 150 fashion-oriented accounts in
Europe and North America.  We expect to grow this division at double-digit rates in 2004
and beyond.

Salomon /// AT SALOMON,  WE HAVE OUR ORIGINS IN WINTER SPORTS AND ARE THE
CLEAR MARKET LEADER IN THIS SECTOR IN TERMS OF SALES,  PRODUCT INNOVATIONS
AND RACING RESULTS.  DOMINATING THE 2002 OLYMPIC GAMES IN SALT LAKE CITY,  WE
ARE THE NUMBER ONE SUPPLIER OF SKI BOOTS,  BINDINGS AND CROSS-COUNTRY
PRODUCTS.  WE ALSO HOLD LEADING POSITIONS IN SKIS AND SNOWBOARDS.  WE ARE
NOW ALSO TAKING STRONG POSITIONS IN OUTDOOR FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL,  INLINE
SKATES,  SKATEBOARDS AND SURFING PRODUCTS. 

SALOMON: GROWING THE SOFT GOODS BUSINESS AS A STRATEGIC PRIORITY /// While
Salomon remains committed to delivering high-performance hardware,  our future growth
will also be driven by expanding our product profile in footwear,  apparel and accessories.  In
2001,  we launched our first Salomon apparel collection,  combining cutting-edge technical
functions,  such as 'motion fit" and body temperature management with contemporary
styling.  In 2002,  we again earned the prestigious ISPO award for outdoor footwear with the
XA-Pro adventure running shoe. 
MAVIC: HIGH-TECH BIKING PRODUCTS /// Mavic sets the standard as the leading brand
for high-end rims and wheels for mountain and road racing bikes.  In 2002,  we again
introduced major innovations in the product range.  In 2003 and beyond,  Mavic and adidas
Cycling will combine efforts to bring the strongest possible offering of both soft goods and
hardware to the market. 
BONFIRE: THE ULTIMATE IN SNOWBOARD APPAREL /// As a leader in snowboard-specific
features and innovations,  Bonfire's outerwear and streetwear lines represent a major leap
forward in fabric coating technologies.  Bonfire products are extremely waterproof and
highly breathable,  with features designed specifically for snowboarding.  At Bonfire,  our
ongoing focus is to create technical apparel for the wearer that is at home on the mountain
and on the street. 
ARC'TERYX: THE REFERENCE IN TECHNICAL OUTDOOR APPAREL /// Arc'Teryx,  an outdoor apparel and climbing equipment specialist,  was acquired by adidas-Salomon in 2002. 
Arc'Teryx is the hottest brand in North America's outdoor technical apparel market with a
strong track record of product innovation,  including harnesses,  performance backpacks or
most recently technical outerwear and layering systems.  Arc'Teryx sales and profits grew
significantly in 2002.  And looking ahead,  we will extend Arc'Teryx's success by continuously
developing unique and innovative apparel products for the most demanding outdoor sports
enthusiasts. 
CLICHÉ: SETTING TRENDS IN SKATEBOARDING /// Skateboarding is having a huge impact
on youth today.  In 2001,  Salomon acquired Cliché,  the leading European skateboard company.  In 2002,  we doubled Cliché sales and the brand received excellent exposure in all key
US and European skateboard publications.  In 2003,  Cliché will launch its first collection of
skateboard-specific footwear.

58 STRATEGY BRAND STRATEGIES

TaylorMade-adidas Golf /// EXCELLENCE IN GOLF REQUIRES A DEEP KNOWLEDGE
OF PLAYERS' NEEDS,  A WIDE PRODUCT OFFERING AND COMMITMENT TO INNOVATE. 
AND THIS UNIQUE COMBINATION DESCRIBES EXACTLY HOW TAYLORMADE-adidas GOLF
APPROACHES THE MARKET.  IN 2002,  WE BECAME THE WORLD'S LEADING METALWOOD
SUPPLIER.  WITH STRONG POSITIONS IN GOLF BALLS,  IRONS,  WEDGES,  PUTTERS,  BAGSFOOTWEAR AND APPAREL,  TAYLORMADE-adidas GOLF IS TRULY AN ALL-AROUND
SUPPLIER OF GOLF PRODUCTS.  OUR COMMITMENT TO CONTINUOUSLY INNOVATING OUR
PRODUCTS IN TANDEM WITH ATHLETES IS THE DRIVER OF THEIR STRONG SUPPORT
FOR TAYLORMADE-adidas GOLF PRODUCTS. 

EXPANDING FROM THE METALWOOD BASE /// TaylorMade is the world's largest supplier
of metalwoods.  With cutting-edge innovations such as the new R500 drivers,  TaylorMade
products are leading the industry.  To extend this success into other golf categories,  TaylorMade began to direct more of its product development and marketing resources toward
irons and wedges,  the next major segment of the golf equipment market.  New irons
launched at the end of 2002 are based upon the company's proprietary 'RAC" technology. 
RAC (Relative Amplitude Coefficient) which significantly improves the 'feel" of the TaylorMade irons and wedges and has been incorporated into all of the brand's premium irons
for 2003.  As a result,  double-digit growth is projected from this category in 2003. 
ROSSA PUTTERS ARE NEW /// In 2002,  TaylorMade introduced 'Rossa",  a premium line of
putters.  Used in 10 professional golf tour wins worldwide,  including the British Open,  the
Rossa line of putters has quickly developed a reputation for the performance and quality
demanded by elite players.  Rossa provides TaylorMade with a critical premium position on
world golf tours and among the top amateurs in the game. 
CONTINUED STRENGTH AT adidas GOLF /// adidas Golf footwear and apparel drive the soft
goods offering within TaylorMade-adidas Golf and this is an area that has been growing
rapidly for the last several years.  We believe there is still significant opportunity for us to
extend the adidas brand in golf products.  Strong endorsement partners including Sergio
Garcia and Retief Goosen support these products vigorously.  Performance rain gear will be
an important new product offering for the brand in 2003. 
MAXFLI: A NEW MEMBER OF THE TAYLORMADE-adidas GOLF FAMILY /// In 2002,  TaylorMade-adidas Golf began managing the marketing and distribution of the Maxfli and
Slazenger Golf brands under a license arrangement with Dunlop Slazenger Group,  providing TaylorMade-adidas Golf with a leading position in the golf ball category.  At the end
of the year,  we decided to end operations in the Slazenger business and to purchase the
Maxfli brand.  The Maxfli Noodle and the Maxfli Performance Series helped drive the Maxfli
brand to become the fastest growing ball brand in the USA in 2002,  with market share
increasing 71% in value terms.  In 2003,  we will continue to build on this promising start by
fully integrating the brand into TaylorMade-adidas Golf and expanding our distribution of
Maxfli products in Europe.

adidas-Salomon /// IN 2002,  adidas-Salomon
DELIVERED EXCELLENT TOP- AND BOTTOM-LINE RESULTS. 
NET SALES INCREASED 7% FROM € 61 BILLION IN 2001 TO
€ 65 BILLION IN 2002.  THE GROUP'S GROSS MARGIN GREW
07 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO 432% OF SALES.  THIS WAS
ACHIEVED DESPITE DIFFICULT RETAIL CONDITIONS IN ALL
MAJOR MARKETS.  THE GROUP'S OPERATING EXPENSES AS
 PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES GREW 11 PERCENTAGE
POINTS TO 359%.  AS A RESULT,  OPERATING PROFIT GREW
TO € 477 MILLION (2001: € 475 MILLION).  adidas-Salomon's
INCOME BEFORE TAXES WAS € 390 MILLION,  UP 4% VERSUS
€ 376 MILLION IN 2001.  LOWER MINORITIES ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE GROUP'S NET INCOME,  WHICH GREW
10% FROM € 208 MILLION IN 2001 TO € 229 MILLION IN
2002.  THIS REPRESENTS BASIC EARNINGS PER SHARE OF
€ 504 VERSUS € 460 IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  THESE RESULTS
ARE AT THE TOP END OF THE EARNINGS RANGE TARGETED
BY MANAGEMENT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR.  FOR
2003,  THE GROUP ANTICIPATES REVENUE GROWTH OF
AROUND 5%,  A VISIBLE OPERATING MARGIN IMPROVEMENT
AND EARNINGS GROWTH OF BETWEEN 10 AND 15%. 

ECONOMIC AND SECTOR DEVELOPMENT
STOCK MARKET LOSSES AND FEAR OF WAR IN IRAQ
CHARACTERIZE US ECONOMY /// 2002 was a year with
largely negative macroeconomic signals from all major
markets.  In the USA,  the economy experienced gross domestic
product (GDP) improvements at the beginning of 2002.  However,  substantial stock market losses,  fears with respect to
the anniversary of the September 11 attacks and uncertainties
surrounding possible military action in Iraq significantly
slowed down growth in the second half of the year.  As a
result,  GDP grew only 2% and consumer confidence,  which
declined in eight of the 12 months,  was at its lowest level in
nine years at the end of December 2002. 
STAGNANT ECONOMIES YIELD LOW CONSUMER SPENDING
IN EUROPE /// European economies showed little growth in
2002 with a GDP increase of less than 1% compared to the
prior year.  The drivers of this development include the deterioration of consumer sentiment due to the introduction of the
euro and corresponding price increases at the beginning of
the year,  rising unemployment as well as a decline in global
price competitiveness owing to the appreciation of the euro. 
Germany has been particularly weak,  with GDP growth of only
02%,  reflecting the worst economic development since 1993. 
NEGATIVE GDP DEVELOPMENT IN ASIA AND LATIN
AMERICA /// In Japan,  GDP growth was negative in 2002. 
Increases in exports and solid growth in private consumption
were more than offset by decreases in both public and private
investment.  Furthermore,  wholesale prices declined and
deflation persisted during the entire year.  In Argentina,  the
economy suffered a severe financial and banking crisis in
2002.  As a result,  GDP declined strongly compared to the
prior year and many other economies in the region were
impacted by spill-over effects. 

Management Discussion&Analysis
62 REPORTING

SPORTING GOODS SECTOR UNDER PRESSURE IN NORTH
AMERICA DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR ///
After a successful first half of the year among sporting goods
retailers,  low consumer confidence and the difficult economic
conditions led to disappointing back-to-school sales which
exacerbated an already strongly promotional environment in
North America.  In addition,  the US West Coast dock dispute
put further pressure on suppliers and retailers who had to
redirect shipments to ensure fall deliveries.  As a resultseveral athletic specialty retailers as well as smaller sporting
goods manufacturers were forced to issue sales and profit
warnings.  Nevertheless,  most of the major suppliers were
able to increase both their sales and earnings. 
MIXED CONDITIONS AT SPORTING GOODS RETAIL IN
EUROPE /// In Europe,  the picture for the sporting goods
market was mixed,  developing similarly to the national
economies.  While market conditions continued to be tough
throughout Central Europe with particular weakness in
Germany,  where the retail sector experienced the worst
trading conditions in more than 40 years,  athletic retail
showed some improvements in the UK,  France and Spain. 
WORLD CUP SPURS GROWTH IN ASIAN SPORTING GOODS
SECTOR /// In Japan and South Korea,  the retail environment
experienced World Cup-driven improvements which continued
throughout the year.  In addition,  expansion of retail doors in
China continued during 2002 mainly as a result of increased
consumer spending. 

GROUP BUSINESS PERFORMANCE
adidas-Salomon SALES REACH RECORD LEVEL OF € 65
BILLION /// Consolidated net sales for the Group grew 7%
from € 61 billion in 2001 to reach € 65 billion in 2002. 
Excluding first-time sales from Arc'Teryx,  Maxfli and
Slazenger Golf,  Group sales grew 5% from € 61 billion in
2001 to € 64 billion in 2002.  This is the highest level in the
Group's history and the eighth year of continued growth since
going public in 1995 and exceeds the Group's 3 to 5% sales
growth target range for 2002.  On a currency-neutral basisGroup sales increased 11%. 
BRAND GROWTH LED BY TAYLORMADE-adidas GOLFWHERE SALES CLIMB 30% /// From a brand perspectiveTaylorMade-adidas Golf again posted the most substantial
gains,  with sales up 30% (+37% currency-neutral) from
€ 545 million in 2001 to € 707 million in 2002.  This reflects
the strength of new product introductions,  in particular the
R500 Series drivers,  as well as the first-time inclusion of
Maxfli and Slazenger Golf revenues.  adidas sales grew 6%
(+10% currency-neutral) from € 48 billion to € 51 billion. 
Drivers of this growth were new Sport Performance footwear
technologies ClimaCool® and a3®,  basketball category sales
which grew nearly 50% year-over-year as well as continued
double-digit growth in the Sport Heritage division.  Salomon
sales declined 4% (–1% currency-neutral) from € 714 million
to € 684 million mainly as a result of poor winter conditions
and weak inline skate sales. 

NORTH AMERICAN SALES RISE TO € 20 BILLION /// In North
America,  sales for the Group grew 8% to € 20 billion in 2002
versus € 18 billion in the prior year.  On a currency-neutral
basis,  this represents a 14% increase.  Sales at TaylorMadeadidas Golf increased most significantly,  up 32% (+39%
currency-neutral).  In addition to the very strong reception of
the R500 Series drivers in the second half of the year,  sales
were helped by the first-time inclusion of the Maxfli and
Slazenger Golf brands.  At brand adidas,  sales grew 4% (+10%
currency-neutral) from € 13 billion in 2001 to € 14 billion in
2002.  This confirms the turnaround of adidas America,  where
sales growth was positive for the first time in four years. 
Salomon sales declined 4% from € 208 million in 2001 to
€ 199 million in 2002.  This decline,  however,  was a result of
the negative currency development.  Currency-neutral sales
grew 2%,  reflecting the strength of Mavic products in the
region as well as new Arc'Teryx sales.

ASIAN SALES REACH € 12 BILLION /// Asia was again the
fastest growing region for the Group.  Sales increased 16% to
reach € 12 billion in 2002 (2001: € 10 billion).  On a currencyneutral basis,  this increase was 23%.  adidas sales grew 20%
from € 726 million in 2001 to € 867 million in 2002,  driven
by vigorous growth of adidas in Japan,  which benefited from
the positive response to the 2002 FIFA World Cup™.  adidas
sales in South Korea,  China,  Hong Kong,  Taiwan and Malaysia
also continued to grow solidly.  TaylorMade-adidas Golf again
grew strongly (+24%) with substantial sales increases coming
from South Korea.  Salomon sales declined 25% in Asia,  as a
result of continued poor winter business and the over-stocked
outdoor footwear market in Japan.  In other Asian markets,  the
Salomon brand grew at double-digit rates,  albeit from a small
base. 
SALES IN EUROPE GROW 4% /// Sales for adidas-Salomon
in Europe grew 4% from € 31 billion to € 32 billion.  On a
currency-neutral basis,  this increase was 5%.  All brands
delivered positive growth.  Sales at brand adidas grew 4%
from € 26 billion in 2001 to € 27 billion in 2002,  primarily
as a result of solid performance in Italy,  UK,  Spain and
France,  driven by our strong footwear range.  Emerging
market sales also continued to grow substantially,  supported
in particular by sales growth in Russia and the Middle East. 
TaylorMade-adidas Golf was also one of the main drivers of
growth in Europe,  with sales up 34% from € 83 million in
2001 to € 111 million in 2002 following the excellent reception
of the new R500 Series drivers.  Salomon also grew,  with
European sales up 3%,  driven largely by increases in the ski
boot and nordic categories in an otherwise challenging winter
market.  In addition,  Mavic sales grew at double-digit rates. 

LATIN AMERICA SALES GROW STRONGLY ON A CURRENCYNEUTRAL BASIS /// In Latin America,  where revenues are
generated predominately by brand adidas,  sales declined 9%
in 2002 to € 163 million (2001: € 178 million).  However,  this
was due to the negative currency developments in the region. 
On a currency-neutral basis,  sales actually grew 31% as a
result of higher sales in Argentina,  Brazil,  Chile and Mexico. 
Salomon and TaylorMade-adidas Golf,  while only minor
components in overall sales,  continued to grow rapidly on a
currency-neutral basis. 
FOOTWEAR SALES UP 8% /// Net sales of footwear within the
adidas-Salomon Group grew 8% to reach € 29 billion in 2002
(2001: € 27 billion).  The strongest growth came from the
adidas Sport Performance basketball and football categories
as well as the Sport Heritage division,  where sales increased
by 36%,  15% and 22% respectively.  Our new footwear technologies ClimaCool® and a3® also helped the running
category grow 7% versus the prior year.  Footwear now
generates 44% of total Group sales,  reaffirming its position
as adidas-Salomon's most important product category.

were the adidas Sport Performance football and basketball
categories,  where sales grew 35% and 101% respectively. 
This reflects the strength of the adidas 2002 FIFA World
Cup™ activities as well as an extended product range in the
basketball category.  First-time inclusion of Sport Heritage
apparel for adidas and the Arc'Teryx brand within Salomon
also contributed positively.

ANOTHER YEAR OF DOUBLE-DIGIT GROWTH FOR HARDWARE SALES /// Hardware sales,  which primarily come from
the TaylorMade and Salomon brands,  again recorded the
strongest growth among product categories,  up 11% to
€ 14 billion versus € 13 billion in the prior year.  Growth in
this area came primarily from TaylorMade-adidas Golf as a
result of the strong introduction of the R500 Series drivers as
well as the first-time inclusion of Maxfli and Slazenger Golf
sales.  In addition,  adidas hardware which comprises bagsballs and protective equipment grew strongly following the
outstanding consumer response to the 2002 FIFA World Cup™
hardware offering.  These developments underscore adidasSalomon's position as the number one global supplier of
sports hardware products,  as measured by total net sales. 
Hardware sales represent 21% of total Group sales. 

LICENSEE REVENUES DECREASE /// Net licensee sales
decreased by 10% from € 642 million in 2001 to € 577 million
in 2002.  This was mainly due to the expiration of an adidas
licensee agreement in Argentina.  The resulting reduction
in licensee income,  however,  was offset by an increase in
consolidated net sales. 
COST OF SALES GROWS SLOWER THAN SALES /// At
adidas-Salomon,  the cost of sales is the amount we pay to
third parties or,  in particular at Salomon and TaylorMade,  for
material,  labor and tooling costs as well as manufacturing
overheads.  It also includes customs duties,  freight and
other expenses (e.g.  insurance,  other taxes) associated with
delivering our products from our manufacturers or our
factories to our sales organizations.  In 2002,  cost of sales
was € 37 billion,  up 5% from the € 35 billion level of 2001. 
This increase was less than Group sales growth.  adidasSalomon cost of sales per product was reduced in 2002,  in
particular in terms of labor costs as well as manufacturing
and administrative overheads,  reflecting the first tangible
benefits from our lean manufacturing programs.

communicated by Management in early 2002.  As a resultGroup gross profit rose 8% from € 26 billion in 2001 to
€ 28 billion in 2002.

GROSS MARGIN GAINS DRIVEN BY BRAND adidas /// The
improvement in the Group's gross margin was the result of a
10 percentage point gain at brand adidas from 382% in 2001
to 392% in 2002.  Drivers of this increase were the expansion
of adidas own-retail activities,  a lower level of clearance
sales,  higher clearance margins and,  most importantly,  an
improving product mix.  The improving euro / US dollar
exchange rate also impacted these figures.  However,  of the
total 10 percentage point gain,  we estimate the currency
impact to be less than 02 percentage points.  Offsetting this
improvement were gross margin declines at Salomon and
TaylorMade-adidas Golf.  At Salomon,  gross margin was down
31 percentage points from 438% in 2001 to 408% in 2002highlighting the continued weakness of the winter and inline
skate markets.  The TaylorMade-adidas Golf gross margin also
declined as a result of the heavily discounted golf market
offering in North America in the first half,  as well as the firsttime inclusion of the lower-margin golf ball business from
Maxfli and Slazenger Golf. 

66 REPORTING MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS /// GROUP BUSINESS PERFORMANCE

EUROPE AND ASIA DRIVE GROSS MARGIN GROWTH /// On
 regional basis,  gross margin improvement was driven by
Europe and Asia,  reflecting strong gains within brand adidas
as described above.  In Europe,  the gross margin grew 20
percentage points from 375% in 2001 to 395% in 2002.  In
Asia,  the gross margin increased 05 percentage points from
475% in 2001 to 480% in 2002.  In North America,  the gross
margin declined 06 percentage points from 373% to 368%. 
Strong improvements at brand adidas as a result of lower
clearance sales at better margins and increased own-retail
activities could not fully compensate for declines at TaylorMade-adidas Golf and Salomon.  In Latin America,  the gross
margin declined 09 percentage points from 408% to 399%impacted by negative currency developments. 
OPERATING EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES
INCREASE IN LINE WITH MANAGEMENT EXPECTATIONS ///
Operating expenses,  including selling,  general and administrative expenses (SG & A) and depreciation and amortization
(excluding goodwill),  grew 10% from € 21 billion in 2001 to
€ 23 billion in 2002.  As a percentage of net sales this equates
to 359% which is 11 percentage points higher than the 2001
level of 348%.  The increase was expected and reflects the
incremental expenses related to key strategic initiatives for
brand adidas,  including additional marketing expenses for the
2002 FIFA World Cup™,  the expansion of own-retail activities
and start-up costs associated with the purchase of the
remaining shares of adidas Italy.  Total incremental costs
were lower than the initially projected € 100 million.  As a
result,  operating expenses for brand adidas increased
11% from € 15 billion in 2001 to € 17 billion in 2002.  At
TaylorMade-adidas Golf,  operating expenses grew 24% from
€ 218 million in 2001 to € 271 million in 2002.  At Salomonoperating expenses declined 4% from € 251 million in 2001
to € 240 million in 2002,  following major efforts to implement
leaner structures in both marketing and R & D activities. 

MARKETING WORKING BUDGET REFLECTS WORLD CUP
EXPENDITURES /// The Group's marketing working budgetwhich is now evenly divided between advertising and promotional expenses,  was € 824 million and represented 126% of
net sales in 2002.  This is a 12% increase versus the 2001 level
of € 734 million (120% of sales). The main driver of this
growth was additional costs related to the 2002 FIFA World
Cup™ activities.  These expenditures were taken with a longterm view to further strengthen the competitive strategic
position of the Group's core brand.  At Salomon,  marketing
working budget expenditures were nearly stable versus the
prior year,  despite increased expenditures associated with
the addition of Arc'Teryx and the Winter Olympics in Salt
Lake City.  Marketing working budget as a percentage of sales
decreased at TaylorMade-adidas Golf despite the new R500
Series launch,  increased spending to strengthen TaylorMade's
professional tour dominance and new marketing expenditures
associated with the Maxfli brand.

EMPLOYEE NUMBER INCREASES IN STRATEGICALLY IMPORTANT AREAS /// At December 31,  2002,  adidas-Salomon
employed 14716 people.  This represents an increase of 6%
versus the previous year's level of 13941.  In 2002,  the largest
number of new employees came from the own-retail sector
and the integration of Arc'Teryx into the Group.  The majority
of our employees now work in sales,  logistics and own-retail
functions.  Personnel expenses (including production)
increased 9% from € 695 million in 2001 to € 758 million in
2002.  Costs which are directly attributable to production are
included within the cost of sales.  In 2003,  we project that the
continued expansion of our own-retail activities will again be
the major driver of increased personnel requirements.

OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDE ONE-TIME GAINS AND
LOSSES /// Operating expenses were impacted by one-time
gains of € 23 million,  which include the release of a legal
provision in the amount of € 15 million and income in the
amount of € 8 million related to the sale of land.  Offsetting
these gains,  however,  were one-time expenses for restructuring programs and legal provisions in the Group which were
also reported in 2002. 
OPERATING PROFIT IMPROVES DESPITE SPENDING ON KEY
INITIATIVES /// Operating profit for the Group increased from
€ 475 million to € 477 million in 2002.  Solid top-line growth
and gross margin improvements more than compensated
for the operating expense increases mentioned above.  On a
brand basis,  the adidas operating profit decreased by 3% from
€ 352 million in 2001 to € 343 million in 2002.  The Salomon
operating profit declined by 38% from € 63 million in 2001
to € 39 million in 2002.  The brand suffered from poor winter
sports conditions in several key markets,  which were partially
offset by continued strong performance at Mavic and growing
soft goods sales.  TaylorMade-adidas Golf had another excellent year with operating profit growing 19% from € 63 million
in 2001 to € 74 million in 2002,  driven by healthy revenue
gains in Asia,  the success of metalwoods and new product
introductions.  The Group's operating profit comparison was
also slightly impacted by the results of central hedging
activities that improved versus the prior year.  Detailed information on the sales and operational performance of the
individual brands is presented in this report (see note 27). 

OPERATING PROFIT GROWS IN ALL REGIONS /// In 2002the Group's positive operating profit development was
underpinned by improvement in all regions (see note 27).  In
Europe,  operating profit grew 6% from € 444 million in 2001
to € 471 million in 2002.  This was generated by operating
profit improvements at all brands.  In North America,  significant operating profit gains at brand adidas more than compensated for declines at Salomon and TaylorMade-adidas
Golf.  As a result,  the region's operating profit grew from € 161
million in 2001 to € 162 million in 2002.  In Asia,  operating
profit grew 11% from € 170 million in 2001 to € 189 million in
2002,  reflecting strong improvements at adidas and TaylorMade-adidas Golf.  In Latin America,  operating profit grew
50% from € 16 million in 2001 to € 24 million in 2002 as a
result of strict cost control at adidas in Latin America. 
ROYALTY AND COMMISSION INCOME UP 9% /// Royalty and
commission income increased by 9% from € 42 million in
2001 to € 46 million in 2002.  This was largely due to a higher
level of sales under licenses for products such as cosmetics
and eyewear,  in addition to higher royalty rates for these
products. 

GROWTH IN AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL DRIVEN BY
ACQUISITIONS /// Goodwill amortization increased by 12%
from € 40 million in 2001 to € 45 million in 2002.  The purchase of the remaining shares of adidas Italy and the acquisition of Arc'Teryx were the main drivers of this increase.  The
largest component of the Group's goodwill amortizationhowever,  continues to be the € 30 million related to the
acquisition of the Salomon group in 1997,  which is being
amortized over 20 years. 
FINANCIAL RESULT HELPED BY LOWER INTEREST
EXPENSES /// Financial expenses declined 14% from € 102
million in 2001 to € 87 million in 2002.  The decline was mainly
attributable to lower interest expenses as a result of lower net
borrowings and average interest rates,  which were partially
offset by higher non-cost-of-sales related exchange rate
effects. 
NO EXTRAORDINARY INCOME RECORDED IN 2002 /// In 2002no extraordinary income was recorded at adidas-Salomon. 
This compares with € 2 million in 2001. 
INCOME BEFORE TAXES INCREASES BY 4% /// Supported
by the favorable movement in the financial result,  income
before taxes increased by 4% from € 376 million in 2001 to
€ 390 million in 2002.  As a percentage of net sales,  income
before taxes declined by 02 percentage points from 62% in
2001 to 60% in 2002,  reflecting a healthy profitability level
despite incremental spending for the strategic initiatives
mentioned under operating expenses.

DOUBLE-DIGIT NET INCOME GROWTH FOR SECOND YEAR
IN A ROW /// Net income for the Group increased 10% from
€ 208 million in 2001 to € 229 million in 2002.  This result was
at the top end of the Group's targeted earnings range.  Solid
sales and gross margin improvements as well as a better
financial result were more than able to compensate for
additional expenses related to the strategic initiatives mentioned above.  Lower minorities and a more favorable tax rate
also contributed to the net income gain.  Minorities declined by
35% from € 21 million in 2001 to € 14 million in 2002 as a
result of the Group's acquisition of the remaining shares of
adidas Italy.  The tax rate improved by 11 percentage points
from 390% to 379%,  mainly due to a more balanced earnings
mix and reduced tax rates in several foreign jurisdictions.

range communicated by Management since the beginning
of 2002.  The Group's total number of shares outstanding
increased by 73300 shares in 2002 to 45422500,  as a result
of the first exercise period of Tranche II of the Management
Stock Option Plan (MSOP) of adidas-Salomon AG.  Diluted

adidas RESEARCH SPLIT BETWEEN TWO LOCATIONS /// For
brand adidas,  the majority of our research and development
activities are located in Herzogenaurach,  Germany,  and
Portland /Oregon,  USA.  Product design and product development for the Sport Heritage products and the Sport Performance categories running,  football,  tennis and training takes
place at the development center in Herzogenaurach,  while
design and development activities for the Sport Performance
category basketball are assigned to Portland.  This allows the
brand to best utilize the skills and resources of the headquarters team and those of our team in the largest market.  Sport
Style products are designed and developed in Herzogenaurach
and Tokyo.

SALOMON AND TAYLORMADE-adidas GOLF RESEARCH
CLOSE TO MARKET /// For Salomon and TaylorMade-adidas
Golf the research and development of products is located
at each brand's respective headquarters.  Salomon's
research and development as well as its marketing and
design activities are mainly concentrated at the Salomon
Design Center in Annecy,  France.  To remain close to its
consumers,  Salomon has additional product-specific design
centers in Montebelluna,  Italy,  for ski and snowboard bootsin Vancouver,  Canada,  for apparel (Arc'Teryx) and in PerthAustralia,  for new Salomon surfing products.  Research
and development activities for TaylorMade-adidas Golf are
centered in Carlsbad /California,  USA. 
THREE REVOLUTIONARY TECHNOLOGIES DRIVE 2002
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES /// In 2002adidas-Salomon launched three ground-breaking technologies: ClimaCool® footwear,  a3® footwear and the R500 Series
golf drivers.  ClimaCool®,  available in both adidas footwear
and apparel,  is a 360° ventilation and moisture management
system which keeps the body measurably cooler and drier. 
a3® is an energy management system developed for adidas
footwear.  The system cushions,  guides and drives the foot
through each stride,  providing optimized energy transfer. 
The TaylorMade R500 Series drivers utilize an expanded COR
zone for greater ball velocity and accuracy.  Each of these
technologies is patented and trademark-protected. 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURE VIRTUALLY
UNCHANGED IN 2002 /// In 2002,  expenditures for research
and development decreased by less than 1% to € 85 millioncompared to € 86 million in 2001.  In addition,  market
research and analysis was incurred as part of the Group's
operating expenses. 

FINANCE AND INVESTMENT
TOTAL ASSETS INCREASE /// In 2002,  total assets grew by
2% to € 43 billion versus € 42 billion in the prior year.  This
increase reflects the January acquisition of the remaining
50% stake in adidas Italy,  the July purchase of a 10% participation in the Bayern Munich football club,  and the December
purchase of the golf brand Maxfli. 
SUCCESSFUL WORKING CAPITAL MANAGEMENT /// As a
result of the focused working capital reduction initiatives
undertaken throughout 2002,  inventories at adidas-Salomon
were reduced by 7% from € 13 billion in 2001 to € 12 billion
in 2002.  On a currency-neutral basis,  inventories increased
1%,  which is significantly lower than year-end backlog growth. 
Improvements were recorded at all brands within the Group. 
The decrease in inventory levels at brand adidas was achieved
despite the double-digit growth in order books for the brand
at year-end.  Following successful clearance efforts,  particularly in the inline skate and soft goods categories,  Salomon
made strong progress in stock reduction,  offsetting the
addition of Arc'Teryx inventory.  Similarly,  inventory reductions
at TaylorMade-adidas Golf were largely able to compensate
for the first-time inclusion of Maxfli stock. 
INVENTORY STRUCTURE IMPROVES FURTHER /// At yearend 2002,  adidas current inventories,  which represent products from the current season,  comprised 76% of the brand's
overall stock level.  This was an improvement of 4 percentage
points versus the prior year and reflects the progress made in
global inventory management,  including careful order planning and focused clearance programs.  In addition,  clearance
margins were improved,  partly as a result of an increase in
adidas own-retail activities. 

70 REPORTING MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS /// RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

RECEIVABLES GROWTH COMPARES FAVORABLY TO SALES
DEVELOPMENT /// Receivables at adidas-Salomon increased
by 3% to € 13 billion in 2002 versus € 13 billion in the prior
year.  On a currency-neutral basis,  receivables increased by
14%.  This rate is below the Group's fourth quarter currencyneutral sales growth and reflects strict discipline in the
Group's trade terms management.  The portion of adidas
receivables not-yet-due improved further by 3 percentage
points from 75% to 78%.  The year-over-year receivables
comparison for brand adidas was flat,  with reductions in
Europe and Asia compensated by increases in the highly
competitive North American region.  As a result of lower
winter sports sales,  year-end receivable balances at
Salomon were reduced.  At TaylorMade-adidas Golf,  strong
sales growth in the last few months of 2002 due to the R500
Series introduction resulted in a significant year-over-year
increase in receivables. 

FIXED ASSETS INCREASE /// Fixed assets (including financial
assets) increased by 13% from € 11 billion in 2001 to
€ 12 billion in 2002.  This increase reflects strategic investments including the purchase of the remaining shares in
adidas Italy and the acquisitions of Arc'Teryx and Maxfli as
well as our 10% participation in the Bayern Munich football
club.  The expansion of adidas own-retail activities and the
completion of our headquarter facilities in North America
also caused fixed assets to increase. 
OTHER ASSETS INFLUENCED BY PARTICIPATION IN
BAYERN MUNICH /// Other current assets were unchanged
at € 267 million in 2002.  Non-current assets grew 35% from
€ 108 million in 2001 to € 145 million in 2002.  The increase
in non-current assets is mainly due to the purchase of a
participation in FC Bayern München AG for the amount of
€ 77 million. 

OTHER LIABILITIES INCREASE DUE TO FAIR VALUATION OF
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS /// Other current liabilities
increased 35% from € 110 million in 2001 to € 149 million in
2002.  Other non-current liabilities grew 45% from € 13 million
in 2001 to € 19 million.  Both these increases were caused
primarily by a decrease in the fair value of the Group's financial instruments (see note 21). 

EQUITY RATIO in % of total assets 
EQUITY RATIO IMPROVES FURTHER DESPITE NEGATIVE
CURRENCY IMPACT /// The Group's equity base was further
strengthened in 2002 despite negative currency effects.  Equity
rose 7% from € 10 billion in 2001 to € 11 billion in 2002.  The
majority of the net income was retained within the Group and
used to strengthen the equity base.  Negative effects came
from the translation of foreign subsidiaries' equity into euro at
year-end due to the decline in the US dollar and other foreign
currencies versus the euro.  As a matter of corporate policyadidas-Salomon hedges for the translation of the local balance sheets only under certain circumstances.  In such casesif certain criteria are met,  we may use changes in functional
currencies of foreign subsidiaries,  changes in the currency
denomination of their monetary assets,  or hedging with
forward contracts or options for this purpose.  In addition,  the
hedging reserve resulting from the fair valuation of financial
instruments used for product sourcing negatively impacted
the year-end equity balance (see note 21).  The equity ratio rose
by 11 percentage points from 243% in 2001 to 254% in 2002. 
Financial leverage,  the ratio of net borrowings to equityimproved 27 percentage points to 139% versus 165% in the
prior year.  This is a result of the Group's strong operational
cash flow,  used to reduce net borrowings.

CASH FLOW AND INVESTMENTS /// The Group's cash provided by operating activities is used for investing activities,  for
the reduction of debt and for the payment of dividends.  Cash
outflows for investing activities were € 325 million in 2002,  an
increase of 84% versus the 2001 level of € 177 million and
included the purchase of tangible,  intangible and financial
assets.  Spending for property,  plant and equipment such as
investments in adidas own-retail activities and in the headquarter facilities in North America decreased by 29% from
€ 160 million in 2001 to € 114 million in 2002.  Cash outflows
for intangible assets were € 151 million versus € 42 million
in 2001 and included the acquisition of the remaining shares
of adidas Italy and the purchase of the Maxfli golf brand in
December 2002.  The net cash used for acquiring subsidiaries
in an amount of € 20 million is related to the acquisition of
the Canadian outdoor specialist Arc'Teryx,  and the purchase
of Salomon Danmark ApS,  a former distribution partner for
Salomon products in Denmark.  These companies have now
been fully integrated into adidas-Salomon.  The Group's
financial assets increased with the purchase of a 10% stake in
the Bayern Munich football club for € 77 million in July 2002. 
NET BORROWINGS REDUCED BY € 181 MILLION /// Net
borrowings at December 31,  2002 were € 15 billion,  down
11% or € 181 million versus € 17 billion in the prior year. 
This represents the Group's lowest debt level in five years. 
Positive currency effects influenced Group borrowing levelscontributing roughly half of the improvement.  Excluding these
effects,  net borrowings were reduced in line with Management
targets despite the Group's strategic participation in Bayern
Munich as well as the purchase of Arc'Teryx,  the buyout of the
remaining shares of adidas Italy and the acquisition of
Salomon Danmark ApS. 

72 REPORTING MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS /// FINANCE AND INVESTMENT

FINANCING STRATEGY AND NET BORROWINGS /// The
length and diversification of Group credit lines and instruments were further improved in 2002,  despite market trends
towards reduced lending commitments and the avoidance of
maturity extensions for existing commitments.  Utilization of
available credit facilities for the Group was 45% at the end of
2002 versus 52% at the end of 2001.  This improvement highlights the Group's reduced overall borrowings as well as a
slight increase in outstanding credit lines and instruments. 
Other signals of our improved financing structure include
the extension of maturities for the vast majority of adidasSalomon medium-term credit lines from 2005 to 2006. 
Longer-dated private placements with the Group were also
in high demand amongst both domestic and international
investors.  The volume of longer-term private placements
increased strongly,  representing € 560 million of funding in
2002.  The maturities of outstanding private placements
extend now up to 2012.  In addition,  the Group's on-balancesheet asset-backed securities (ABS) program proved to be
 consistent source of funding with nearly equal utilization
rates throughout the year,  and the Group's commercial paper
programs continued to deliver a significant amount of attractively priced funding. 
FAVORABLE INTEREST RATE DEVELOPMENT /// In 2002adidas-Salomon maintained the existing interest rate options
as protection against rising interest rates.  Within this shelterwe were able to participate in the continuous interest rate
reduction throughout the year by contracting the vast majority
of our financing for very short-term periods.  The weighted
average interest rate on the Group's borrowings fell from
45% in 2001 to 32% in 2002.

adidas SALES TOP € 5 BILLION FOR THE FIRST TIME /// In
2002,  adidas net sales increased 6% to € 51 billion compared
to € 48 billion in the prior year.  No new companies were
consolidated into brand adidas sales in 2002,  so all growth
is organic.  On a currency-neutral basis,  this increase was
10%.  Growth came from all regions,  with particular strength
coming from Asia and North America,  where sales grew 20%
(+26% currency-neutral) and 4% (+10% currency-neutral)
respectively.  From a divisional perspective,  sales grew in both
the Sport Performance (+3%) and Sport Heritage (+23%)
divisions.  Own-retail activities also contributed meaningfully
to top-line growth. 
SPORT PERFORMANCE GROWTH DRIVEN BY BASKETBALLFOOTBALL AND RUNNING /// Sales in the Sport Performance
division (previously named the adidas Forever Sport division)
grew 3% in 2002 from € 41 billion in 2001 to € 42 billion in
2002.  This is the largest division within the Group and now
contributes 82% of brand adidas revenues.  The strongest
growing product category in the division was basketballwhere sales increased 46% in 2002 as a result of strong
product introductions including the T-MAC,  T-MAC 2 and All
Day All Night.  In addition,  the Group's leading market position
in football was further strengthened with excellent productswhich were highlighted at the 2002 FIFA World Cup™. 
SPORT HERITAGE SALES GROW 23% /// At € 904 millionsales from the Sport Heritage division (previously named
adidas Originals) were again the largest component of brand
adidas growth,  increasing more than 23% versus € 736 million
in 2001.  As a result,  Sport Heritage now makes up 18% of
brand adidas sales.  Footwear sales in the Sport Heritage
division grew 22% from € 686 million in 2001 to € 837 million
in 2002.  Apparel and accessories,  which were first introduced
as a full collection in 2002,  contributed € 68 million to adidas
sales.

SALES UP IN BOTH FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL /// Looking
at sales from a product perspective,  adidas footwear sales
grew 9% (+14% currency-neutral) from € 25 billion in 2001
to € 27 billion in 2002.  Sales grew 22% in the Sport Heritage
division,  which serves as a strong indicator of brand perception.  In addition,  both football and basketball grew at strong
double-digit rates,  reflecting the acceptance of our marketing
initiatives in these categories.  In apparel,  sales grew 2% (+5%
currency-neutral) from € 21 billion in 2001 to € 22 billion in
2002.  The Sport Performance categories basketball and
football led this growth with increases of 101% and 35%
respectively.  adidas hardware sales which include ballsbags,  socks and protective gear increased 17% from
€ 185 million in 2001 to € 217 million in 2002,  as a result
of the strong response to 2002 FIFA World Cup™ product
introductions. 
adidas OWN RETAIL AN IMPORTANT DRIVER IN TOP-LINE
GROWTH /// An increasingly important part of brand adidas
revenues is own-retail activities.  Own retail within adidas
consists of four major components: concept stores,  concession corners in developing markets,  factory outlets and
Internet sales.  In 2002,  adidas operated 162 concept stores
(2001: 120).  These stores market Sport Performance and /or
Sport Heritage products directly to the consumer.  adidas
concession corners,  which number 269 (2001: 288),  provide
sales infrastructure in the developing markets,  in particular in
Asia.  Factory outlets,  which are utilized to optimize clearance
activities for brand adidas,  are located in North America and
Europe and currently number 174 (2001: 157).  Internet sales
are available at www, adidas, com.  adidas own-retail activities
made up 8% of brand sales in 2002,  up from 7% in the prior
year.  This represents an increase of 16% from € 354 million
in 2001 to € 410 million in 2002.  This was driven both by
comparable sales growth and new store openings.  These
sales are not intended to exceed 10% of adidas sales in the
medium term. 

GROSS MARGIN IMPROVEMENT REFLECTS BETTER
PRODUCT MIX AND LOWER CLEARANCE /// The adidas
gross margin improved by 10 percentage points from 382%
in 2001 to 392% in 2002.  Drivers of this improvement were
increased own-retail activities as described above,  lower
clearance sales and an improving product mix.  Despite the
heavily promotional retail environment in the USA,  adidas
gross margin increased in all regions except Latin America.

As a percentage of net sales,  this represents an increase of
16 percentage points from 309% in 2001 to 325% in 2002. 
Marketing expenses associated with the 2002 FIFA World
Cup™,  the expansion of adidas own-retail activities and startup costs related to the purchase of the remaining shares of
adidas Italy were the drivers of this increase.  As a result of
these developments,  adidas operating profit decreased 3% to

adidas BRAND SALES GROW 4% IN EUROPE /// Sales for
brand adidas in Europe increased 4% from € 26 billion in
2001 to € 27 billion in 2002.  On a currency-neutral basissales grew 4%.  The strongest gains came from Italy,  where
sales grew nearly 20%,  on the heels of a new business modelfollowing the Group's purchase of the remaining shares of
adidas Italy.  Solid gains were also recorded in the UK,  Spain
and France.  In Central Europe,  in particular Germany,  sales
declined in 2002 although performance improved in the
second half of the year.  In the Emerging Markets,  which
comprise our activities in Eastern Europe and Africa,  revenues continued to grow at double-digit rates,  with particularly strong gains in Russia.  Increased key account activity
and adidas own-retail activities also drove positive top-line
growth. 

FOOTWEAR SALES IN EUROPE UP 7% /// On a product category basis,  adidas sales in Europe increased most significantly in footwear,  up 7% from € 12 billion in 2001 to
€ 13 billion in 2002.  On a currency-neutral basis,  this
increase was 8%.  Growth drivers were the Sport Heritage
division,  where sales rose 17% year-over-year,  and the Sport
Performance categories football and running,  which grew
22% and 8% respectively.  This growth correlates strongly to
the Group's strong marketing activities around the 2002
FIFA World Cup™ and the introduction of the ClimaCool®
and a3® running technologies.  Sales of tennis and training
footwear declined as a result of lower tennis participation in
countries such as Germany,  Spain and Italy and due to a
general shift from training to running footwear purchases
among consumers.

adidas APPAREL SALES IN EUROPE NEAR STABLE THANKS
TO STRONG WORLD CUP INITIATIVES /// European apparel
sales were stable at € 13 billion in 2002.  On a currencyneutral basis,  this was a decrease of 1%.  Football apparel
delivered strong growth,  with sales increasing 27% year-overyear reflecting Europe's World Cup fever.  Double-digit sales
gains were also recorded in the basketball category,  albeit
from a very small base.  Sport Heritage apparel also got off
to a strong start in Europe,  the category's most important
region.  These improvements,  however,  were offset by a
decline in Sport Performance training apparel,  which
although down 7% versus the prior year was significantly
better than the overall market development in the category. 
OWN-RETAIL ACTIVITIES AND LOWER CLEARANCE SALES
HELP adidas GROSS MARGIN IN EUROPE /// The adidas
gross margin in Europe was 400%,  up 20 percentage points
versus 2001 when the gross margin was 380%.  The main
drivers of this improvement are lower clearance saleshigher price points and increased own-retail activities in
Europe.  In addition,  the improving product mix also helped
margin development in the region. 

HIGHEST YEAR-END BACKLOG GROWTH SINCE 1997 /// At
the end of 2002,  orders in Europe were up 10%.  On a currency-neutral basis,  this improvement was 12%.  This is the
highest year-end backlog growth for the region since 1997. 
Footwear is the main driver of this improvement,  with backlogs up 20% (+23% currency-neutral).  Apparel orders grew
1% (+3% currency-neutral).  The difference between euro and
currency-neutral figures reflects particularly strong growth
in the UK and other countries not included in the European
Union Euro Zone.  Backlogs are growing at solid rates in all
major markets.  As a result,  adidas expects mid-single-digit
sales growth in Europe for 2003.

adidas DEVELOPMENT IN NORTH AMERICA
DOUBLE-DIGIT CURRENCY-NEUTRAL SALES GROWTH IN
NORTH AMERICA /// adidas sales in North America grew 4%
from € 13 billion in 2001 to € 14 billion in 2002.  Restated on
 currency-neutral basis,  sales increased by 10%.  In 2002adidas was again confronted with a difficult retail market in
North America.  Nevertheless,  the basketball category grew
strongly,  led by the number one selling T-MAC (February) and
T-MAC 2 (November and December).  These were the brand's
first and second top selling shoes in the USA in over six years
(according to the SportsScan data provider),  highlighting
the growing support for the brand and the category within
North America.  Additionally,  the brand's two new footwear
technologies ClimaCool® and a3® also drove strong performance in the running category.  Own-retail sales grew
solidly in the region,  in particular at concept stores and on
the Internet.  Clearance activities were down substantially in
2002,  reflecting significantly improved inventory management
in the region. 

BASKETBALL FOOTWEAR SALES IN NORTH AMERICA GROW
45% /// By product category,  adidas footwear sales increased
8% from € 818 million in 2001 to € 884 million in 2002 (+14%
currency-neutral).  Sales grew most strongly in the Sport
Heritage division,  where revenues increased 19% year-overyear.  Strong sales were also recorded in the Sport Performance basketball and running categories,  which grew 45%
(+56% currency-neutral) and 10% (+18% currency-neutral)
respectively.  On a currency-neutral basis,  only training and
kids sales declined versus the prior year,  where the product
offering has yet to prove its competitive positioning in the
broader market. 
CURRENCY-NEUTRAL adidas APPAREL SALES IN NORTH
AMERICA GROW FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 1998 ///
adidas apparel sales in North America declined 2% from
€ 489 million in 2001 to € 480 million in 2002.  Currencyneutral,  apparel sales grew 3%.  The Sport Performance
basketball category led sales growth with revenues up 118%
year-over-year (+128% currency-neutral),  reflecting excellent
response to the new apparel line.  Tennis also grew stronglywith apparel sales growing 24% versus the prior year.  The
Sport Heritage division also delivered solid double-digit
growth,  albeit from a very low base.  On a currency-neutral
basis,  only training sales declined versus the prior year.  This
reflects the impact of the strong licensed apparel market in
the USA and the extremely promotional environment for kids
products. 
IMPROVING PRODUCT MIX AND LOWER CLEARANCE
SALES DRIVE GROSS MARGIN IMPROVEMENTS IN NORTH
AMERICA /// The gross margin in North America improved
11 percentage points to 359% in 2002 versus 348% in 2001. 
Lower clearance sales at higher margins,  improving margins
at own retail and a better product mix were all important
contributors to this development. 

78 REPORTING MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS /// adidas DEVELOPMENT IN NORTH AMERICA

DOUBLE-DIGIT CURRENCY-NEUTRAL SALES GROWTH
EXPECTED IN NORTH AMERICA IN 2003 /// Sales in 2003 will
again grow at double-digit rates.  Footwear will continue to be
the primary growth driver,  with particularly strong gains in
the athletic specialty channel.  Both basketball and running
will be solid growth categories for adidas in North America. 
Year-end backlogs for the region were down 3% in euro
terms,  but up 15% on a currency-neutral basis,  highlighting
the strong devaluation of the US dollar over the last year.  This
represents the fifth consecutive quarter of positive currencyneutral backlog growth in the region.  On a product basisfootwear orders were down 2% in euro terms (+16% currencyneutral).  Apparel backlogs were down 6% but actually grew
12% on a currency-neutral basis.  As a result of this backlog
development,  we are confident that we will continue to grow
at double-digit rates on a currency-neutral basis in North
America.

adidas DEVELOPMENT IN ASIA
SALES MOMENTUM CONTINUES FOR adidas IN ASIA /// From
 regional perspective,  the adidas brand grew most vigorously
in Asia in 2002.  Brand sales were up 20% to € 867 million
from € 726 million in 2001.  On a currency-neutral basis,  this
growth was 26%.  Brand sales in the region have tripled in the
last four years.  The largest component of this increase was
again sales improvement at adidas Japan which not only
gained substantial momentum from our sponsorship of 2002
FIFA World Cup™ hosts Japan,  but also delivered over 20%
organic growth.  In addition to these gains,  South Korea,  Hong
Kong,  Taiwan and,  in particular,  China all delivered solid
improvements.  Smaller markets such as New Zealand,  India
and Malaysia also showed impressive growth rates,  enabling
adidas to strengthen its leading position in these markets. 
adidas SALES IN ASIA GROW IN BOTH FOOTWEAR AND
APPAREL /// The main growth driver of adidas sales in Asia
was footwear,  which grew 19% from € 371 million in 2001 to
€ 442 million in 2002.  Strongest performance was delivered
by the Sport Heritage division,  where sales were up 40% yearover-year,  reflecting the high demand for such products in
Japan and Hong Kong.  Solid growth also came in the Sport
Performance football category,  where World Cup excitement
helped push footwear sales up 23% versus the prior year. 
In apparel,  sales grew 20% from € 316 million in 2001 to
€ 380 million in 2002 following the success of our World Cup
products.  Sales in the football apparel category grew an
impressive 101% year-over-year.  The only decline recorded
in footwear or apparel in the region was in the very small
tennis apparel category,  as a result of lower participation
rates in Japan. 

GROSS MARGIN FOR adidas IN ASIA GROWS STRONGLY ///
The gross margin for adidas in Asia improved by 10 percentage points from 445% in 2001 to 455% in 2002.  This is the
highest regional gross margin,  with improvements coming
from most major markets. 
adidas IN ASIA SET TO DELIVER CURRENCY-NEUTRAL
GROWTH AGAIN IN 2003 /// In 2003,  we are expecting continued strong growth from adidas in Asia.  With two major sporting events the Men's World Cup in rugby and the Women's
World Cup in football we expect to generate continued high
visibility for the brand in our major regional markets.  This will
allow adidas to strengthen its performance image,  following
the solid success of the 2002 FIFA World Cup™.  The Sport
Performance running and basketball categories are expected
to generate the most vigorous growth in the region.  In addition,  double-digit increases in the Sport Heritage division are
also anticipated in Asia.  Order backlog development supports
this vision,  with orders up 11% in euro terms or 22% on a
currency-neutral basis.  Footwear is again expected to be the
driver of growth for the region,  with backlogs up 28% in euros
or 40% on a currency-neutral basis.  Apparel backlogs,  which
were down 2% in euros,  grew at 7% on a currency-neutral
basis.

CURRENCY-NEUTRAL adidas SALES IN LATIN AMERICA
GROW 31% /// Latin America sales declined 9% from
€ 174 million in 2001 to € 158 million in 2002.  This declinehowever,  was driven solely by negative currency effects.  On a
currency-neutral basis,  sales grew 31% with strong increases
in Brazil and Mexico. 
UNDERLYING FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL SALES GROW IN
LATIN AMERICA /// adidas footwear sales in Latin America
declined by 11% from € 122 million in 2001 to € 109 million
in 2002.  On a currency-neutral basis,  this represents an
improvement of 26% and was driven mainly by the region's
largest footwear category: running.  In this category,  sales
declined 19% (+20% currency-neutral).  Sport Heritage products also sold strongly in the region,  with sales up 32% (+70%
currency-neutral) signaling strong brand momentum in the
region.  Apparel sales declined by 6% from € 42 million to
€ 40 million.  Currency-neutral,  this represents an improvement of 41% year-over-year.  The two major drivers of this
improvement were growing sales in the football and training
categories,  where sales grew 1% (+40% currency-neutral) and
declined 1% (+40% currency-neutral) respectively versus the
prior year.  On a currency-neutral basis,  no category in the
region declined versus the prior year.

OUTLOOK FOR adidas IN LATIN AMERICA CONTINUES TO BE
CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC /// Although order taking in Latin
America is less formalized than in other regions of the worldinitial discussions with customers suggest that currencyneutral sales are expected to grow in Latin America during
2003.  Currency effects,  however,  continue to be significantwhich makes euro-based targets difficult to quantify.  The
primary drivers of this growth will be improved brand
positioning in major markets as well as increased adidas
own-retail programs.  The Group also expects to continue to
improve local sourcing efforts in the region,  which will drive
margin improvements and reduce risks related to currency
fluctuations. 

adidas GROSS MARGIN IN LATIN AMERICA DECLINES ///
The gross margin decreased by 08 percentage points in Latin
America,  from 406% in 2001 to 397% in 2002.  This again was

ARC'TERYX CONTRIBUTES TO THE TOP LINE /// Net sales for
the Salomon brands decreased by 4% from € 714 million in
2001 to € 684 million in 2002.  On a currency-neutral basisthis decline was only 1%.  Excluding the first-time inclusion
of € 26 million from Arc'Teryx,  Salomon sales declined
8% (–5% currency-neutral) from € 714 million in 2001 to
€ 658 million in 2002. 
NEGATIVE SALES DEVELOPMENT DRIVEN BY POOR INLINE
SKATE AND WINTER MARKETS /// Sales of winter productswhich currently make up 69% of Salomon sales (2001: 69%)
declined 5% (–2% currency-neutral) as a result of difficult
market conditions.  Excess inventories at retail following a
difficult 2001/2002 winter market,  combined with little snow
in Europe at the beginning of the 2002 / 2003 season,  hindered
Salomon winter sales.  Summer products,  which comprise
31% of Salomon sales (2001: 31%),  also declined in 2002 as
anticipated,  as a result of the extremely poor global inline
skate market and continued difficulties of the brand in Japan. 
At Mavic,  bike component sales grew 28%,  faster than any
other part of the Salomon business. 

SOFT GOODS SALES RISE 11% /// Hardware sales for
Salomon in 2002 were € 526 million or 77% of total sales
(2001: 80%).  This represents a decline of 8% versus the
previous year's € 571 million level.  Key products in this area
include alpine skis,  bindings and boots as well as cycling
products,  inline skates and snowboard products.  Soft goodswhich consist of Salomon,  Bonfire,  Cliché and Arc'Teryx
footwear,  apparel and accessories,  generated € 159 million
or 23% of Salomon sales in 2002 (2001: 20%),  up 11% from
€ 143 million in 2001.  Strong sales at Arc'Teryx and the
continued introduction of Salomon's own apparel line led to
58% revenue growth for apparel in 2002.  In the medium termsoft goods sales are expected to grow to 50% of total Salomon
sales. 
SALES GROWTH IN ALL REGIONS EXCEPT ASIA /// Despite
an overall decline in sales,  currency-neutral sales grew in
three of the four Salomon regions in 2002.  In EuropeSalomon's largest market,  sales were up 3% from
€ 383 million in 2001 to € 395 million in 2002,  with growth in
bike components,  soft goods and winter sports more than
balancing the decline in inline skates.  In North Americasales declined 4% from € 208 million in 2001 to € 199 million
in 2002.  On a currency-neutral basis,  this represents an
increase of 2% and is primarily related to higher soft goods
sales in the region.  In Asia,  sales declined 25% (–18% currency-neutral) from € 112 million in 2001 to € 84 million in
2002,  reflecting the severely depressed winter sports and
outdoor footwear markets in Japan.  In Latin America,  sales
declined 14% from € 4 million to € 3 million,  which equates
to a 45% increase on a currency-neutral basis. 

GROSS PROFIT DECLINE REFLECTS POOR MARKET CONDITIONS /// The gross profit declined 11% from € 313 million
in 2001 to € 279 million in 2002.  This is due to lower margins
at Salomon as a result of the lower percentage of winter
goods and Japanese sales in total revenues and higher
clearance sales in the inline skate categories.  In additiongross profit was affected by the first-time inclusion of
Arc'Teryx sales,  which carry a lower average margin than
other Salomon products.  As a result,  Salomon margin was
408%,  down 31 percentage points from the previous year's
level of 438%. 
OPERATING EXPENSES DECREASE /// Operating expenses
at Salomon decreased 4% from € 251 million in 2001 to
€ 240 million in 2002.  This improvement was driven by lower
marketing and R & D overheads throughout the brand,  in
particular as a result of the closure of the Salomon Design
Center in Boulder/ Colorado,  USA.  As a result of the brand's
lower sales,  operating expenses as a percentage of net sales
was constant with the prior year at 351%.  The operating
profit for Salomon declined 38% from € 63 million in 2001
to € 39 million in 2002. 

SALES GROWTH TO RETURN IN 2003 /// Because of the
strong seasonality of Salomon's business and the often shortterm nature of orders within the winter sports industry,  we do
not provide backlog information for the Salomon family of
brands.  However,  net sales of Salomon brand products are
expected to increase in 2003,  as a result of higher Salomon
soft goods sales.  Arc'Teryx will continue to drive strong
apparel growth for Salomon.  In addition,  surfing products will
be launched for the first time in 2003.  These high-tech products are being developed in Perth,  Australia and are expected
to boost brand awareness but deliver only low revenues in
2003.  On the other hand,  the winter sports and inline skate
categories are expected to remain under pressure.  We expect
that,  in addition to these challenging market conditionscurrency pressures will continue to impact gross margins. 
Although the vast majority of Salomon products are manufactured in Europe,  over 40% are sold in other regions,  which
have all experienced currency devaluation versus the euro
in recent months.  As a result,  cost of sales is expected to
increase significantly in 2003,  which will directly impact the
Salomon gross margin.  To combat these challenges,  further
cost controls have been put in place at Salomon.

STRONG ORGANIC GROWTH AT TAYLORMADE-adidas GOLF
AS WELL AS EXCELLENT MAXFLI AND SLAZENGER GOLF
SALES /// Net sales at TaylorMade-adidas Golf grew
30% from € 545 million in 2001 to € 707 million in 2002.  On
 currency-neutral basis,  sales grew 37%.  The first-time
inclusion of Maxfli and Slazenger Golf sales impacted sales
figures,  particularly in North America where the brands
are primarily marketed.  Excluding Maxfli and Slazenger
Golf sales,  TaylorMade-adidas Golf sales grew 12% from
€ 545 million in 2001 to € 610 million in 2002.  On a currencyneutral basis,  this increase was 18% and is the highest sales
growth among Group brands. 
METALWOODS SALES GROW 24% /// In particular,  TaylorMade metalwoods sales were up 24% from € 280 million in
2001 to € 348 million in 2002.  This is the industry's largest
and most important category.  As a result of this growthTaylorMade-adidas Golf is now the world leader in annual
metalwoods sales.  The R500 Series,  a new line of metalwoods
which help to optimize the swing characteristics of individual
golfers,  was the primary contributor of growth in the category. 
In 2002,  the TaylorMade R500 Series drivers were the leading
drivers on the US,  European and Japanese professional golf
tours.  Sales in the category were also helped by continued
strong sales of the 300 Series metalwoods.  Metalwoods
comprise nearly 50% of TaylorMade-adidas Golf sales. 

STRONG PUTTER AND GOLF APPAREL DEVELOPMENT ///
Putter sales at TaylorMade-adidas Golf were strong in
2002,  following the very successful introduction of the new
Rossa putter line.  As a result,  putter sales grew 60% from
€ 11 million to € 18 million.  Golf apparel,  marketed under
the adidas Golf and TaylorMade brands,  also grew 10%
from € 39 million to € 43 million as a result of continued
expansion of distribution throughout the golf market. 
Declines in other categories were driven by lower sales in
North America,  as a result of the highly promotional golf
market and flat participation rates. 

HIGHEST SALES GROWTH IN NORTH AMERICA REFLECTS
STRONG UNION WITH MAXFLI /// On a regional basis,  the
largest revenue growth in 2002 came from North Americawhere currency-neutral sales grew 39%.  In euros,  this
increase was 32% growing from € 289 million in 2001 to
€ 382 million in 2002.  These gains were largely driven by the
first-time inclusion of sales from Maxfli and Slazenger Golfwhich are positioned most strongly in North America.  As a
result of this strong addition,  the Group decided to purchase
the Maxfli brand at the end of 2002.  Organic sales from
TaylorMade-adidas Golf grew 3% (+9% currency-neutral)largely as a result of the strong uptake of the R500 Series
drivers following their introduction in the second half of the
year. 
DOUBLE-DIGIT SALES GROWTH CONTINUES IN EUROPE AND
ASIA /// In addition to its strong showing in North AmericaTaylorMade-adidas Golf grew solidly in Europe and Asia.  In
Europe,  sales grew 34% (+35% currency-neutral) from
€ 83 million in 2001 to € 111 million in 2002.  This reflects
the positive response to the R500 Series drivers and the
expanding putters category,  which made major advances this
year with the introduction of the Rossa putter.  In Asia,  sales
grew 24% (+32% currency-neutral) from € 172 million to
€ 214 million reflecting particularly strong performance in
South Korea. 

OPERATING PROFIT GROWS 19% /// Operating profit for
TaylorMade-adidas Golf increased 19% from € 63 million in
2001 to € 74 million in 2002.  This occurred despite additional
expenses associated with the launch of the R500 Series
drivers and marketing activities to support the Maxfli and
Slazenger Golf brands. 
SALES AND PROFITABILITY GROWTH EXPECTED AGAIN
IN 2003 /// In late 2002,  adidas-Salomon purchased the
Maxfli golf brand but chose not to exercise an option for the
Slazenger Golf brand.  Elimination of the Slazenger business
from 2003 TaylorMade-adidas Golf sales will reduce revenues
by approximately € 25 million and have a short-term dampening effect on growth prospects for the family of golf brands. 
In spite of the elimination of Slazenger,  we are confident that
sales for the other brands in the golf division will continue
to develop positively.  Although backlogs are measured very
differently in golf,  making them a less reliable indicator than
in other sports categories,  the Group remains confident that
sales will develop positively.  adidas Golf and the TaylorMade
irons category,  in particular,  are expected to grow strongly. 
Operating profits will also rise as a result of improved gross
margins coupled with lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales. 

GROSS PROFIT AT RECORD LEVEL /// TaylorMade-adidas Golf
gross profit increased 23% to surpass € 300 million for the
first time ever.  2002 gross profit was € 345 million versus
€ 281 million in the prior year.  The gross margin was 488%down 27 percentage points versus the record level of 515%
in 2001.  This decline reflects lower margins in North Americawhich resulted from the very promotional golf market.  In
addition,  the new golf ball business introduced with Maxfli
and Slazenger Golf carries a lower margin than the overall
TaylorMade-adidas Golf business.

Risk Management /// AS A RESULT OF OUR INTERNATIONAL GROWTH AND PROFIT TARGETS,  adidas-Salomon
IS CONTINUOUSLY CONFRONTED WITH A VARIETY OF
GLOBAL AND LOCAL BUSINESS RISK FACTORS.  THESE
RISKS CAN BE INTERNAL OR EXTERNAL,  AND IF NOT
APPROPRIATELY MANAGED MAY AT TIMES NEGATIVELY
INFLUENCE THE GROUP'S GOALS,  STRATEGIES,  BRAND
IMAGE,  OR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND HEALTH.  TO
ADDRESS THESE RISKS,  adidas-Salomon HAS CREATED
AND UTILIZES A COMPREHENSIVE RISK MANAGEMENT
SYSTEM.  THE MAJOR ELEMENTS OF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT INCLUDE THE IDENTIFICATION,  ANALYSIS,  REPORTING AND COMMUNICATION OF RISKS. 

RISK MANAGEMENT PHILOSOPHY /// Risks are a part of
business,  and our focus is to balance risk awareness with
the need to identify,  create and fully exploit opportunities. 
adidas-Salomon approaches risk management by:
> Fully integrating it into day-to-day business functions at
all organizational levels. 
> Configuring our organization to allow for early identificationevaluation,  effective communication and management
of risk.  This requires suitable action for risk avoidancereduction,  transfer or acceptance,  and continuous
monitoring. 
> Preparing and implementing an appropriate reporting
structure and contingency plans to reduce the potential
risk impact to an acceptable level. 
> Requiring participation in risk management from managers
and employees at all levels of the Group.  In particular,  the
Executive and Supervisory Boards support the development of a pro-active,  forward-looking risk management
culture within all brands and regions of the Group. 

RISK IDENTIFICATION AND ANALYSIS /// The international
sporting goods industry is highly competitive and success
depends on the correct assessment of future trends and
challenges.  Management continuously gathers and analyzes
business intelligence,  including a qualitative assessment of
the future business environment,  in order to best identify
strategies to avoid or lower risk.  The major risks inherent
either to the Group specifically or to the sector in which we
operate are as follows:
CONSUMER SPENDING /// The sporting goods industry is
sensitive to changes in the economic environment.  Recessioninflation and political instability often result in considerable
changes in consumer sentiment and buying behavior.  This can
result in lower sales and /or profits,  however we believe that
the sporting goods industry tends to be less subject to these
influences than other consumer goods sectors.  In addition,  we
believe that our geographical sales are balanced in such a
way as to compensate for consumer spending shortfalls in
individual countries from having a critical impact on the
stability of our Group's business. 
CONSUMER PREFERENCES AND BRAND IMAGE /// The
image of our brands and overall consumer preferences can
affect how well our products are accepted.  Changes in consumer sentiment with respect to brand identity,  competitors'
products and market trends have a potential impact on sales
and margins.  To manage this risk,  we conduct market and
trend research regarding design,  quality,  image and price
point issues.  We continuously work on the development of
technology and design innovations to ensure that our products
are up-to-date and that they meet consumer needs and
expectations. 

adidas COLOURS /// PARKA

86 REPORTING MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS /// RISK MANAGEMENT

MARKETING COSTS /// Strengthening and expanding a strong
brand identity requires considerable expenditure in terms of
marketing and other forms of communication.  Because the
impact of marketing campaigns cannot be fully predicted in
advance,  product launches are subject to considerable financial risk.  Working with top-tier marketing and advertising
agencies to create messages and thoroughly evaluating major
campaigns allows us to minimize the risk of disappointing
results. 
PRODUCTION AND SUPPLY /// The vast majority of adidasSalomon products are produced by independent factories in
accordance with our technical and design specifications. 
Inferior quality and /or delivery delays can impact Group
revenue and reputation.  To mitigate this risk,  adidas-Salomon
employs more than 100 quality control officers who monitor
factory performance.  Detailed product cost analyses are
performed both before purchase and over time to ensure
competitive pricing and identify opportunities for further
margin improvements.  Regular benchmarking of all
suppliers identifies optimal product allocation,  cost,  quality
and delivery performance.  To avoid over-dependence on
individual suppliers,  we maintain relationships with
numerous and geographically diverse manufacturers,  all
of whom adhere to our best practice standards. 

CURRENCY /// adidas-Salomon largely outsources production
to the Far East (Southeast Asia and China) where sales are
transacted in US dollars.  As a result,  70 to 80% of the sourcing volume over the last three years was incurred in US
dollars.  The percentage of sales revenues in US dollars and
other non-euro currencies is significantly lower,  with about
half of the Group's sales denominated in European currencies.  Changes in exchange rates,  especially the relation
between the US dollar and the euro,  therefore have the
potential to markedly affect revenues.  To reduce exposure in
these areas,  natural hedges are applied wherever possible. 
The transactional currency risk is concentrated at our
sourcing entities,  which invoice Group companies primarily
in their local currencies.  As protection,  the Group hedges
currency risk for a period up to a maximum of three selling
seasons,  using a combination of forward contracts and
options.  Until early 2002,  we concentrated our hedging on
forward contracts,  with a smaller share of options-based
hedges.  At a very early stage in the decline of the US dollarwe shifted our concentration to options-based hedging
instruments,  which provide downside protection while,  at the
same time,  leaving enough room for participation in further
favorable exchange rate developments. 

87

FINANCING NEEDS /// Due to high debt levels that are largely
related to the acquisition of the Salomon group in 1997interest rate changes can have a significant impact on adidasSalomon's financial position and earnings.  For example,  we
estimate that a 1% increase or decrease in average interest
rates could affect after-tax earnings by € 11 million over a
12-month period.  To minimize this risk,  the vast majority of
our borrowings are protected with interest caps against a
major rise in interest rates.  Under this protection,  the risk is
closely monitored and managed with appropriately structured
financing,  further interest rate hedging or other derivative
products (see note 21).  Financing and currency risk are largely
managed centrally at Group level. 
SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS /// We have
continuing responsibilities to our workers and the physical
environment.  Malpractice in these areas can have a significant impact on the reputation and operational efficiency of
our Group and its suppliers.  Our Social and Environmental
Affairs (SEA) team monitors the factories of adidas-Salomon
suppliers to ensure compliance with social,  environmentalhealth and safety standards,  creating and implementing
action plans to ensure improvements where necessary. 
The most sustainable way to enforce compliance with our
Standards of Engagement is by providing constant trainingcommunication and consultation for our suppliers' management and their workers.  For this reason,  the SEA team has
increased its focus on training our business partners in
developing systems for self-governance,  in addition to monitoring them. 

adidas /// CALIBRATE RUNNING SHOE

88 REPORTING MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS /// RISK MANAGEMENT

LEGAL MATTERS /// As a global corporation,  adidas-Salomon
operates under a wide variety of legal and regulatory frameworks.  Finding solutions for various legal matters in numerous countries entails risk for the Group,  especially in the
formulation of contracts,  the resolution of corporate legal
issues and the taking of legal action.  To manage these tasksinternal and external specialists are assigned to these
matters.  Based on all outstanding litigation,  we believe that
the ultimate liabilities resulting from any claims will not
materially affect the consolidated financial position of the
Group. 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION AND PIRACY ///
For adidas-Salomon,  the protection of product innovationspatents,  technologies and designs is crucial.  Products such
as footwear and apparel are frequently manufactured and
distributed by third parties in violation of adidas-Salomon
trademark rights.  To reduce the risks inherent in violation of
industrial property rights,  which may lead to lost sales and
brand image impairment,  we have created significant internal
resources to battle brand infringement.  These teams work
closely with international institutions (such as customs
authorities) in countries where these violations occur. 

PRODUCT LIABILITY /// As a supplier of consumer productsadidas-Salomon can face legal action if and when defective
products are sold.  Apart from the financial consequences of
product liability cases,  for which we have adequate insurance
cover,  these cases may damage market perception of our
products,  resulting in image impairment.  Through intensive
quality control we seek to minimize these risks. 
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY /// adidas-Salomon utilizes a
complex network of communications and applications in its
business activities.  Therefore natural disaster,  criminal
mischief or IT mismanagement could result in a severe
disruption of our business.  We have employed various
methods to mitigate these risks and prevent or minimize
such disruptions.  These actions include but are not limited
to hardware and software experts,  firewall and encryption
technologies,  and contingency business continuity planning. 
PROPERTY /// adidas-Salomon products are manufacturedshipped and stored all over the world.  Physical damage to
premises,  production units and warehouses can lead to
business interruption.  These risks are mitigated by a variety
of loss prevention measures which include working with
reliable suppliers and logistics providers who guarantee high
safety standards.  adidas-Salomon also maintains sufficient
insurance cover to prevent financial loss in the event of such
damage. 

RISK REPORTING /// adidas-Salomon regularly reviews
specific risks within these areas.  The Group's risk reporting
practice includes a systematic reporting framework,  ensuring
that timely,  accurate and relevant information is available for
the respective decision makers.  This process begins with an
assessment of the risk probability and the classification of
those risks according to the likelihood of their occurrence and
possible consequences. 
The Group carefully considers the financial impact of risks
on the forecasted earnings of each respective brand and
regional business unit for the current financial year as well
as for the longer term.  This process is supported by an
integrated controlling organization throughout all levels of
the Group. 

RISK COMMUNICATION /// In addition to risk identificationwe believe that fast and effective communication of risks
across all appropriate functions and levels is necessary to
ensure the required cooperation and decision-making
support to optimally manage exposure.  This occurs not only
in regular reports and business reviews but also in everyday
communication.  When appropriate,  this information is also
communicated externally. 
SAFEGUARDING THE ONGOING BUSINESS /// Despite
obvious business risks,  adidas-Salomon is operationally and
financially strong,  with sizable assets and liquidity.  We are
constantly working to reduce and transfer risk as much as
appropriate.  For example,  in 2002 we founded a captive
insurance company (adidas International Re Ltd. ) in Dublinwhich will commence its business activities in 2003,  helping
to improve risk management and better utilize the Group's
financial resources. 
With respect to the current business outlook,  no immediate risks have been identified which could jeopardize the
Group's ongoing business health and viability.  The Group's
equity capitalization and earning power form a solid basis for
our future business development.  We have taken appropriate
precautions against typical business risks that could negatively
affect our financial standing and profitability situation.

WILL HELP US DELIVER STRONG TOP- AND BOTTOM-LINE

AND FINANCIAL HEALTH OF THE GROUP.  WITH STRONG
BRAND MOMENTUM,  NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND MARKETING
INITIATIVES,  WE EXPECT TO GROW adidas-Salomon
REVENUES BY AROUND 5% AND DELIVER EARNINGS
GROWTH OF BETWEEN 10 AND 15%. 

INTERNATIONAL MARKETS REMAIN UNDER PRESSURE ///
Given the difficult environment at the beginning of the yearmajor improvements in the overall global economic performance are unlikely for 2003.  The ongoing tension in the Middle
East and its uncertain outcome puts the recovery of global
markets at risk.  As a result,  the current consensus among
leading economists is that economic growth will proceed at a
low level in 2003.  For the USA,  a slight improvement seems to
be possible from the second half going forward,  driven by
further tax reductions and continued low interest rates. 
Nevertheless,  GDP is expected to grow at a level lower than in
2002.  In Europe,  with GDP growth of around 15% in 2003
most economists project a small improvement compared to
the prior year.  At the same time,  the prospects for Germany
are not as promising,  partly due to its high dependence on
world trade and the exchange rate.  The growth prospects for
Asia and in particular for South East Asia and India will be
tightly linked to global security issues and the possible war
in Iraq.  However,  GDP growth in Japan continues to be uncertain.  In Latin America,  the macroeconomic instability is
expected to continue throughout 2003. 
SPORTING GOODS SECTOR OUTLOOK MIXED /// The outlook
for the sporting goods sector in 2003 remains mixed.  Despite
the negative macroeconomic developments in the USA,  it is
anticipated that low interest rates and low unemployment will
act as anti-cyclical cushions for consumer spending.  As a
result,  the general retail environment is expected to improve
in the second half of the year.  However,  uncertainty remains
because of the ongoing situation in the Middle East.  The
market for winter products will be as difficult as it was in
the prior year due to the persistent poor snow conditions in
Europe and Asia early in the season.  While the golf market
should offer sustainable growth opportunities in Asia and
Europe,  the US golf business will be challenging going forward given the recent declines in the number of golf rounds
played and the extremely promotional environment at retail. 

90 REPORTING MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS /// OUTLOOK

DOUBLE-DIGIT INCREASES IN THE USA AND ASIA DRIVE
adidas-Salomon SALES GROWTH /// In 2003,  we strive to
sustain healthy top-line expansion.  This means that Group
sales are projected to grow around 5% in 2003 with currencyneutral growth coming from all regions.  In particular,  doubledigit sales increases in North America and Asia will be major
contributors.  The strong momentum of our brands in America
will continue and we expect to again deliver double-digit
growth in footwear and to significantly accelerate growth in
apparel as well.  In Asia,  growth is likely to be characterized
by continued strong adidas brand momentum in Japanfollowing the very successful 2002 FIFA World Cup™ activities. 
Greater China will be another important source of growth in
the region.  In Europe,  adidas-Salomon is targeting moderate
overall gains,  supported by substantial improvements in key
markets such as Italy and the UK as well as further growth
with key accounts.  In Latin America,  moderate sales
increases are expected,  although growth in the region is
uncertain because of regional effects tied to financial crises
in several key markets. 

FOOTWEAR INNOVATIONS CONTINUE TO GENERATE STRONG
GROWTH FOR adidas SPORT PERFORMANCE /// Within the
adidas Sport Performance division,  our two new footwear
technologies are undergoing major modernization and commercialization in 2003.  As a result,  the strong brand momentum and reputation for product innovation will continue in
2003.  ClimaCool®,  our 360° ventilated shoe which reduces
foot moisture and heat,  will be supported by a global marketing campaign in four key sports categories: running,  basketball,  tennis and training.  It will also be expanded into apparel. 
As a result,  we are projecting sales of at least two million
pairs of ClimaCool® shoes and two million pieces of ClimaCool® apparel.  a3®,  the second technological innovation from
adidas,  cushions the foot but additionally guides the foot to
optimal footstrike and encourages energy management
during sport.  This exciting footwear,  which is being introduced
in three variations heel,  forefoot and twinstrike (combines
heel and forefoot technology) will again be highlighted as
part of our marathon series sponsorship in the spring and
summer. 

DOUBLE-DIGIT GROWTH CONTINUES AT adidas SPORT
HERITAGE /// The Sport Heritage division,  which was up by
23% in 2002,  will continue to grow at double-digit levels in
2003.  As a result,  we anticipate sales of at least € 1 billion. 
The apparel and accessories category introduced in 2002
will continue to outpace footwear growth and is expected to
generate € 100 million (up from € 68 million in 2002). 
Growth will also be supported by own-retail activities,  with
the opening of five new Sport Heritage stores in 2003. 
adidas SPORT STYLE SALES BEGIN /// Sales in the adidas
Sport Style division will begin in the first quarter of 2003. 
Footwear,  apparel and accessories products will be sold
exclusively at 150 retail partners in major metropolitan areas. 
Both 2003 sales and expenses for this division will be in the
low double-digit million euro range.  adidas Sport Style is
projected to be profitable by 2004 and will not comprise more
than 5% of overall brand adidas sales in the long term. 

BASKETBALL CATEGORY TO LEAD adidas SPORT PERFORMANCE GROWTH /// Sales development in the adidas Sport
Performance division will again be driven by strong performance in the basketball,  running and football categories.  In
basketball,  where sales are expected to grow most stronglythe T-MAC and a strong product offering in the mid-price
point category are expected to help the category grow most
strongly.  Running,  led by the expansion of our two revolutionary new footwear technologies ClimaCool® and a3® is
also expected to grow at double-digit rates.  In football,  the
Women's World Cup in China will continue to generate excitement for football and adidas products.  Positive sales growth
but at lower rates is also expected in the training and tennis
categories. 

adidas ORIGINALS ///

SALOMON GROWTH TO RETURN IN 2003 /// 2003 will be
another important year for the repositioning of Salomon
towards a more seasonally-balanced group of brands.  In
particular,  we will put much stronger emphasis on footwear
and apparel products,  which we believe should play an important role in Salomon's future profitability.  On a regional levelthe strongest growth will come from North America as a
result of the improving outdoor footwear sales and the continued strength of Arc'Teryx.  Product category increases are
again likely to be highest for apparel,  where Salomon's multibrand strategy and in particular Arc'Teryx will allow Salomon
to expand its outdoor technical apparel at double-digit rates. 
Inline skate sales are expected to decline in light of the global
softening of this market. 
OPERATING PROFIT GROWTH TO CONTINUE AT TAYLORMADE-adidas GOLF DUE TO STABLE SALES DEVELOPMENT
/// At TaylorMade-adidas Golf,  2003 is expected to be a year of
business stabilization following the rapid growth of the last
three years.  Successful integration of the Maxfli brand is critical to this effort.  adidas Golf footwear and apparel categories
are likely to generate the highest growth rates,  capitalizing on
the strength of the adidas brand in our golf business.  Other
products to watch include the R500 Series and TaylorMade's
new line of RAC irons. 

GROSS MARGIN TARGET NARROWED TO BETWEEN 42 AND
43% /// The adidas-Salomon Group plans to deliver gross
margins in a range of 42 to 43% during 2003.  This represents
 tighter range than we have given for the last two years and
reflects our confidence in the Group's ability to continue to
improve its product mix and increase its proportion of adidas
own-retail sales.  Gross margin in Europe will also be helped
by the improving euro / US dollar exchange rate,  although it is
likely that a portion of this improvement will be compensated
for by gross margin declines associated with lower Japanese
yen / US dollar and pound sterling / US dollar exchange rates
and concessions that may need to be given to European
retailers as sourcing prices decline.  As a result of these
developments,  adidas-Salomon is now targeting near stable
gross margins in 2003. 

OPERATING MARGIN IMPROVEMENT EXPECTED /// Operating
expenses as a percentage of net sales are expected to decline
in 2003.  In 2003 and beyond,  strict cost control will continue to
be a top priority throughout all divisions of the Group as part
of our ongoing efforts to achieve further efficiency improvements.  Cost-saving initiatives will gradually reflect selective
structural organization changes.  One example of this is the
'Winning in Europe" project that is expected to significantly
streamline the adidas Europe organization over the next three
years.  As a result,  operating margin is expected to improve in
2003. 
NET INCOME TO INCREASE 10 TO 15% /// As a result of all
the positive developments mentioned above,  we expect an
acceleration of the Group's earnings growth in 2003.  We are
targeting 10 to 15% net income growth.  The primary drivers of
this increase will be top-line improvements,  a constant gross
margin and an improving operating margin. 
CAPITAL EXPENDITURE WILL BE STABLE /// In 2003capital expenditure for the Group is expected to be between
€ 150 million and € 200 million and should remain relatively
constant for the next few years.  Major projects for the year
include the expanded adidas own-retail activities and global
supply chain improvements,  in particular IT hardware and
software. 
EFFECTIVE CASH FLOW MANAGEMENT REMAINS A MANAGEMENT PRIORITY /// The further optimization of working
capital levels and continued careful scrutiny of capital investments will remain a top Management priority in 2003.  We are
committed to reducing working capital as a percentage of
net sales in 2003 and beyond.  It is adidas-Salomon's goal to
further decrease net borrowings by at least € 100 million per
year for the Group going forward. 

92 REPORTING MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS /// OUTLOOK

2003 AND BEYOND /// 2003 will clearly be another important
year for adidas-Salomon.  The Group has exciting innovations
and events to showcase its products in 2003.  In the medium
term,  adidas-Salomon strives to extend its market-leading
position in Europe,  expand its share of the US footwear
market to 20% and continue to deliver significant sales
increases in Asia.  Further cost control is also expected
to support continued earnings growth.  Improving our
management of working capital and reducing debt remain
important Group priorities.  And in 2004,  adidas-Salomon will
again introduce a major technological footwear innovation
to the market,  which will help continue positive top-line
development.

Corporate Governance Overview /// THE LAST
YEAR REPRESENTED A MAJOR MILESTONE FOR adidasSalomon IN OUR EFFORTS TO ENSURE RESPONSIBLE AND
VALUE-ORIENTED CORPORATE MANAGEMENT.  CONTINUING
OUR ENDEAVORS TO GUARANTEE A HIGH STANDARD OF
TRANSPARENCY WITH REGARD TO THE GOVERNANCE OF
adidas-Salomon,  WE DEVELOPED THE adidas-Salomon
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES.  THESE PRINCIPLES
DOCUMENT OUR COMMITMENT TO STRENGTHENING THE
RIGHTS OF SHAREHOLDERS,  TO UPHOLDING TRUE AND
FAIR TRANSPARENCY AND REPORTING STANDARDS AS
WELL AS MAKING THE COMPOSITION,  RESPONSIBILITIES
AND FUNCTIONING OF THE EXECUTIVE AND SUPERVISORY
BOARDS CLEAR EXTERNALLY. 

 TRADITION OF STRONG CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
PHILOSOPHY /// Good corporate governance has always been
an integral part of the adidas-Salomon business philosophy. 
Over the years,  we have consistently made major efforts in
communicating and increasing transparency about our Group. 
For example,  the Social and Environmental Report,  that we
have regularly published since 2000,  reflects our commitment
not only to improve issues related to the environment and
working conditions but also to ensure transparency in these
areas.  In 2002,  we further increased our focus on responsible
and value-oriented corporate management.  We established a
Corporate Governance working group,  comprised of members
of the Executive and Supervisory Boards.  This working group
developed adidas-Salomon's Corporate Governance Principles,  based on the German Corporate Governance Code as
well as on the recommendations of other internationally
recognized codes of best practice.  In December 2002,  the
Executive and Supervisory Boards issued the adidas-Salomon
Declaration of Compliance with the German Corporate
Governance Code.  The adidas-Salomon Corporate Governance
Principles were approved by the Executive and Supervisory
Boards in January 2003.  A full text version of these documents is available on our corporate website at www, adidasSalomon, com. 
SHAREHOLDERS' RIGHTS /// Our shareholders exercise their
rights at the Annual General Meeting according to the 'one
share one vote one dividend" principle.  They ratify the
actions of the Executive and Supervisory Boards as well as the
appropriation of retained earnings.  In addition,  the Annual
General Meeting approves changes in the adidas-Salomon
Articles of Association. 
To encourage maximal Annual General Meeting interestwe webcast our Annual General Meetings via the Internet.  In
2002,  we were also among the few German companies to offer
 video transmission in German and English of the Annual
General Meeting in its entirety,  including the discussion
between our shareholders and Management.  Moreover,  a
representative can be reached during the Annual General
Meeting to exercise shareholders' voting rights in accordance
with their instructions.

SUPERVISORY BOARD /// The adidas-Salomon Supervisory
Board is composed of 12 members who are diverse in their
professional background and nationalities.  Six members are
elected by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting
and six members are elected by the employees pursuant to
the German Co-Determination Act (MitBestG).  The term of
office of the current Supervisory Board members will expire
at the end of the Annual General Meeting in May 2004. 
The role of the Supervisory Board is to advise and supervise the Executive Board in the management of the Group. 
The Supervisory Board is involved in all decisions of fundamental importance to the Group.  It appoints and dismisses
the members of the Executive Board.  The members of the
Supervisory Board receive a fixed remuneration that is
approved by the Annual General Meeting and incorporated
into the Articles of Association.  We report the cumulative
remuneration of the Supervisory Board in the notes to the
consolidated financial statements (see note 31) and on our
corporate website. 

SUPERVISORY BOARD COMMITTEES /// In order to increase
the efficiency of its work and better handle complex issuesthe Supervisory Board of adidas-Salomon AG has established
three committees:
> The General Committee deals with Executive Board personnel matters. 
> The Mediation Committee submits proposals to the Supervisory Board regarding the appointment and the dismissal
of Executive Board members in cases where the majority
of two-thirds of the Supervisory Board necessary for an
appointment or a dismissal is not achieved. 
> The Audit and Accounts Committee,  set up in 2003,  handles
issues of accounting and risk management,  the necessary
independence required of the auditors,  the issuing of the
audit mandate to the auditors,  the determination of auditing focal points and the fee agreement.  The auditors shall
disclose to the Audit and Accounts Committee without
delay any issues that could potentially affect their impartiality or require their eventual disqualification. 
For specific information on the activities of these committees
in 2002,  please see the Supervisory Board report. 

EXECUTIVE BOARD /// The adidas-Salomon Executive Board
is comprised of seven members who reflect the diversity and
the international nature of the Group.  The Executive Board
develops the adidas-Salomon strategy and ensures its implementation.  It guarantees appropriate risk management and
risk control within the Group (see Risk Management).  The
Executive Board also explains deviations in the actual business development versus original plans and targets.  The
remuneration of the members of the Executive Board is made
up of a fixed salary and a variable component.  The variable
component is linked to individual and Group performance. 
In addition,  members of the Executive Board receive stock
options not to exceed 10% altogether of the total issued under
the Group's Management Stock Option Plan (MSOP) (see note
30).  This plan provides additional compensation when
absolute and /or relative performance targets for the development of the adidas-Salomon share price occur.  We report the
cumulative remuneration of the Executive Board in the notes
to the consolidated financial statements and on the corporate
website,  subdivided according to fixed,  performance-related
and long-term incentive components (see note 31). 

AVOIDING CONFLICT OF INTEREST /// The Executive and
Supervisory Board members are required to act in the best
interests of the Group and shall not pursue personal interests
in their decisions.  Each member of the Executive Board is
required to disclose any potential conflicts of interest to the
Supervisory Board without delay and to inform the other
members of the Executive Board accordingly.  Should the
occasion arise,  the Supervisory Board will report these conflicts and how they have been dealt with to the Annual General
Meeting.  Any consultancy or service agreements concluded
between a member of the Supervisory Board and adidasSalomon AG requires the approval of the Supervisory Board. 
The amounts paid under such agreements will be disclosed
cumulatively in the annual report.  All transactions between
the Group companies and Executive Board members as well
as between Executive Board members and persons or companies with whom they have a close association must comply
with customary standards for arm's length business practice
and require the approval of the Supervisory Board. 

COOPERATION BETWEEN THE BOARDS /// An important
component of good corporate governance is open dialog and
constant cooperation between the Executive and Supervisory
Boards.  By tradition,  our Executive and Supervisory Boards
have had a constructive and efficient working relationship in
the best interests of the Group.  Rules of Procedure for both
Boards underpin,  among other things,  this collaboration.

(D & O Policy). 

IMPROVING TRANSPARENCY /// At adidas-Salomon,  we are

alerts Internet users automatically regarding major adidasSalomon upcoming events.  We publish all key financial
information in English and German and make it accessible on
the Group's website.  In addition to detailed information about

DISCLOSURE OF DIRECTORS' DEALINGS AND CHANGES
TO SHAREHOLDER STRUCTURE /// Pursuant to §15 a of the
German Securities Trading Act (WpHG),  our Executive and
Supervisory Boards are bound to disclose without delay the
purchase and sale of adidas-Salomon shares should this
surpass € 25000 in 30 trading days.  This information is
made available in the corporate governance section of our
corporate website.  adidas-Salomon has not received any
notification of such transactions to date.  Pursuant to § 21
section 1 WpHG,  adidas-Salomon has to inform the financial
community regarding major changes in the shareholder
structure,  as soon as an investor acquires,  exceeds or falls
below 5%,  10%,  25%,  50% or 75% of the voting rights in the
Group.  This occurs on the corporate website and in a national
journal for statutory stock market notices in Germany upon
notification from the respective shareholder. 
COMPLIANCE WITH THE GERMAN CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
CODE /// adidas-Salomon welcomes the German Corporate
Governance Code that was implemented in February 2002with the aim to make Germany's corporate governance rules
transparent for both domestic and international investors and
thus strengthen confidence in the management of German
corporations.  Our Group complies with the German Corporate
Governance Code recommendations and suggestions with the
following exceptions:
> adidas-Salomon's D & O liability insurance does not include
 deductible for Executive and Supervisory Board members
(Corporate Governance Code,  § 338). 
> Our Articles of Association do not specify an age limit for
the members of the Executive and Supervisory Boards
(§ 512 / 541). 

> In order to ensure the necessary independence of the
work of the Supervisory Board members,  the Articles of
Association do not provide performance-related compensation nor a special compensation for committee work. 
adidas-Salomon publishes the compensation for advisory
or agency services stating the total amount of such compensation as well as the total number of Supervisory Board
members who have rendered corresponding advisory or
agency services (§ 545). 
> Until 2002,  the tasks listed under § 532 of the Corporate
Governance Code were performed by the entire Supervisory Board.  The Supervisory Board will set up an Audit and
Accounts Committee that assumes these responsibilities in
2003 (§ 532). 
> The German Corporate Governance Code recommends
reporting the shareholdings of individual Executive and
Supervisory Board members if these directly or indirectly
exceed 1% of the shares issued by a company.  It also
recommends reporting the holdings of the Executive and
Supervisory Boards if the entire holdings of all members
of the Executive and Supervisory Boards exceed 1% of the
shares issued by a company.  adidas-Salomon reports such
shareholdings as soon as they exceed 5% (§ 66). 
> In 2002,  prior to submitting a proposal for the election
of the auditor,  the Supervisory Board did not obtain a
statement from the auditor saying whether,  and where
applicable,  which professional,  financial and other
relationships existed between the auditor and its executive
bodies on the one hand and the Group and the members
of its executive bodies on the other hand.  The Supervisory
Board will,  however,  request such statements starting in
2003 (§ 721). 

OUTLOOK /// Establishing relevant corporate governance
principles is an ongoing process,  which improves with time
and in response to new laws and standards.  At adidasSalomon,  we are committed to continuously developing and
improving our Corporate Governance Principles.  Our Corporate Governance Officer regularly monitors the conformity of
adidas-Salomon with compliance rules and reports to the
Executive and Supervisory Boards.  All relevant corporate
governance information is available on our corporate website.

Supervisory Board Report ///

98 REPORTING CORPORATE GOVERNANCE /// SUPERVISORY BOARD REPORT

DEAR SHAREHOLDERS /// In the year under review,  the
Supervisory Board dealt in detail with the business,  financial
position and strategic orientation of the adidas-Salomon
Group.  It regularly advised the Executive Board in matters
concerning the running of the business and oversaw the
management of adidas-Salomon AG.  The Executive Board
kept the Supervisory Board regularly informed about the
position of the Group,  corporate policy and matters relating
to major business transactions.  The Supervisory Board
performed its tasks laid down by law and the Articles of
Association and was directly involved in all decisions of fundamental importance.  The Chairman of the Supervisory Board
also maintained regular contact with the Executive Board
between the Supervisory Board meetings and was kept
informed about the current business situation. 
In five joint meetings with the Executive Board,  the Supervisory Board reviewed in detail the business and financial
development of the adidas-Salomon Group as well as the
individual operational units and the major Group companies. 
The external auditor attended the annual financial statements
meeting of the Supervisory Board and the meetings where
the quarterly financial statements were presented.  The
meeting attendance rate of the Supervisory Board members
in the year under review was 98%.  No Supervisory Board
member participated in less than half of the meetings.  The
Supervisory Board approved urgent transactions by way of
two resolutions by circular vote. 

MAIN TOPICS COVERED BY THE SUPERVISORY BOARD ///
At the beginning of the year,  the Supervisory Board approved
the budget and investment plan for the adidas-Salomon
Group.  In March,  the Executive Board presented to the
Supervisory Board the main focus of the future marketing
strategy and the strategic orientation of the Group.  In Maythe Supervisory Board gave its approval to issuance of the
fourth tranche of the stock option plan (MSOP) for management executives of adidas-Salomon AG and its affiliated
companies.  The development of sales and earnings for the
Group and the individual operational units was the subject
of regular consultations.  In August,  the Executive Board
informed the Supervisory Board in detail about business
development and the future business strategy in the USA.  The
new Sport Style division developed with Yohji Yamamoto was
the subject of review by the Supervisory Board in November. 
Furthermore,  the Supervisory Board approved the planned
acquisition of the Maxfli brand (golf balls and golf accessories)
from Dunlop Slazenger Group Ltd. 
The Executive Board and the Supervisory Board welcome
the German Corporate Governance Code.  They have discussed
the Code in depth.  In the year under review,  the Executive
Board and the Supervisory Board established a working
group to develop Corporate Governance Principles for adidasSalomon AG.  In December,  the Executive Board and Supervisory Board issued a joint Declaration of Compliance on the
German Corporate Governance Code. 

EXAMINATION OF THE 2002 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ///
KPMG Deutsche Treuhand-Gesellschaft Aktiengesellschaft
Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft,  Frankfurt am Main,  has
audited the financial statements of adidas-Salomon AG for
the year under review prepared by the Executive Board in line
with the provisions of the German Commercial Code (HGB)
as well as the management report.  The auditor issued an
unqualified opinion thereon. 
As in the previous year,  consolidated financial statements
were prepared in compliance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS).  Under the provisions of § 292a
HGB,  these financial statements exempt adidas-Salomon AG
from drawing up consolidated financial statements in accordance with German Commercial Law.  The auditor issued an
unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements
and the management report. 
The financial statements and the auditor's reports were
presented to all the members of the Supervisory Board in
good time.  They were discussed in detail at the meeting of
the Supervisory Board on March 10,  2003.  The auditor
was present at the annual financial statements meeting. 
He reported on the material results of the audit and was
available for the provision of supplementary information. 
Having examined the consolidated financial statementsthe financial statements of adidas-Salomon AG,  the
management reports and the proposal put forward by the
Executive Board regarding the appropriation of retained
earnings,  the Supervisory Board approved the results of the
audit.  At its meeting on March 10,  2003,  the Supervisory
Board approved the financial statements and the consolidated
financial statements.  The Supervisory Board also agreed with
the proposal put forward by the Executive Board regarding
the appropriation of retained earnings. 

COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES /// In the year under review the
Supervisory Board had two standing committees. 
The General Committee dealt with personnel matters
related to the Executive Board on seven occasions in 2002,  in
meetings and by way of resolutions by circular vote. 
The Mediation Committee,  formed in accordance with
§27 section 3 of the German Co-Determination Act (MitBestG)submits proposals to the Supervisory Board regarding the
appointment or dismissal of Executive Board members if the
two-thirds Supervisory Board majority necessary for an
appointment or dismissal is not achieved.  This committee did
not meet in 2002. 
CHANGES ON THE EXECUTIVE BOARD /// At the Supervisory
Board meeting held on August 6,  2002,  the Supervisory Board
appointed Mr.  Ross McMullin as a member of the Executive
Board of adidas-Salomon AG with effect from September 12002. 

OUTLOOK /// In 2002,  the targets adidas-Salomon set for
itself were achieved and even partly exceeded.  The results
that are stated in this annual report illustrate top operational
and financial performance.  It is clear that the conditions
created in the prior year have led to strong success in 2002. 
The Supervisory Board believes that in the future the Group
will continue to succeed in meeting its established targets. 
At the beginning of the 2003 fiscal year,  the Executive Board
and the Supervisory Board approved the adidas-Salomon
Corporate Governance Principles,  which are largely in conformity with the German Corporate Governance Code.  The
Corporate Governance Working Group will further develop
these principles on an ongoing basis with regard to possible
changes to the Code.  Furthermore,  the Supervisory Board
set up an 'Audit and Accounts Committee" in 2003,  whose
duties will include dealing with matters relating to financial
reporting and risk management,  as well as the required
independence of the auditor and the determination of the
main points of focus for the audits. 
We appreciate the tremendous work of the Executive
Board,  the Management Boards of the Group companies,  the
Works Council and all employees and thank them for their
ongoing commitment.

104 REPORTING

ALIGNING ACTIVITIES AND SHARING BEST PRACTICE /// In
2002,  Global Operations reorganized its activities to better
service the large portfolio of brands at adidas-Salomon.  As a
result,  our consumer-oriented structure was extended to
Global Operations in an effort to align its activities more
closely with the Group's marketing and sales endeavors.  This
meant closely intertwining our supply chain operations with
each of our divisions versus a traditional organizational
structure aligned by product type (e.g.  footwear,  apparel and
hardware).  By working more closely with marketing and sales
colleagues,  we are now able to better and more quickly
understand and react to unique customer and consumer
preferences.  At the same time,  critical corporate functions
such as sourcing,  global supply chain and administration
continue to be managed at the Group level.  This allows us to
capitalize on our Group leverage to enlist the best suppliersfactories and third-party logistics providers in the industry
in getting products made and delivered to our customers. 
As a result of this reorganization,  our product is now more
reflective of our brand values,  internal communications have
improved dramatically and we are sharing best-practice
methods throughout the Group. 
WORKING TOGETHER WITH SUPPLIERS /// With the vast
majority of our products being produced by independent
manufacturers,  our relationship to suppliers is critical to the
Group's success (see Risk Management).  Our supply chain
utilizes three different types of suppliers.  The first group
consists of suppliers who have a direct contractual business
relationship with us.  By contrast,  subcontractors are companies that have been subcontracted by our suppliers and do
not have a direct business relationship with adidas-Salomon. 
The third group consists of local sourcing companies,  which
source and manufacture products for local markets,  rather
than Group-wide distribution.  We provide all of our suppliers
with detailed technical and design specifications for the
production and delivery of our products.  In addition,  we
enforce strict quality control and inspection procedures. 
Such procedures include the regular presence of our more
than 100 quality control officers in these factories during
the manufacturing process.

1%.  The largest footwear factory produced approximately 14%
of the footwear purchased by adidas-Salomon in 2002. 
APPAREL PRODUCTION AROUND THE GLOBE /// Apparel
production is less concentrated geographically than footwear. 
Indonesia and China were the largest sourcing countriesrepresenting 18% and 16% of total apparel production.  The
remaining 66% was produced by independent manufacturers
in other Asian countries,  Europe and the Americas with
31%,  23% and 12% respectively.  No single apparel factory
produced more than 10% of our total apparel purchases in
2002. 
HARDWARE PRODUCED CLOSE TO MARKET /// With respect
to hardware,  adidas-Salomon focuses on producing close to
major markets.  Salomon hardware is largely manufactured
by subcontractors in Romania.  Additionally,  Salomon,  Mavic
and Cliché also maintain own production sites in Francewhich concentrate on high-end products and new technological developments.  The majority of TaylorMade's golf club
components are produced in China and then assembled by
TaylorMade in the major markets.  All golf balls marketed by
TaylorMade-adidas Golf are produced by the Dunlop
Slazenger Group in the USA. 

CONSOLIDATING THE SUPPLIER BASE TO CUT COSTS AND
SPEED UP DELIVERY /// For 2003 and beyond,  we strive to
strengthen the relationships with our key supply partners by
further consolidating our supplier base.  This will give us
more influence with these vendors,  enabling us to better drive
our quality initiatives as well as our cost saving and delivery
performance efforts.  Since 2000,  we have reduced the number
of our footwear suppliers by more than 35%.  While we will
continue this consolidation process in the future,  concentration is now being placed on reducing the number of our
apparel suppliers. 
LEAD-TIME REDUCTION AS A GROUP PRIORITY /// At adidasSalomon,  supply chain management means optimizing the
delicate balance between costs,  quality and delivery performance,  and this is a major priority for us.  This is why our
Global Operations activities are currently focused on two key
areas: lead-time reduction and new supply chain models. 
Lead times in the footwear industry average 15 to 18 monthswith 12 months elapsing for the product creation cycle and
another three to six months for order placement,  raw material preparation,  manufacturing and delivering products to
retail.  Shortening the product creation process and accelerating procurement is enabling us to create products best
tailored to meet current market needs and improve customer
service in terms of both faster time to market and competitiveness.  This will help us to reduce inefficiencies,  improve
quality and minimize costs.  At the same time,  enhanced
lead times contribute to the Group's goal of tight inventory
management. 

LEAN MANUFACTURING PRINCIPLES LEAD TO MEASURABLE SUCCESS /// At the end of 2002,  footwear lead times
have already been reduced significantly.  More than 80% of our
footwear volume is being produced in 60 days,  as opposed to
90 days in 2001 and as long as 120 days two years ago.  This
success is primarily attributable to the introduction of lean
manufacturing principles,  which have eliminated non-valueadding activities throughout the entire manufacturing process. 
In addition,  we improved our labeling,  packaging and special
handling capabilities at various points throughout the supply
chain.  This has enabled us to bypass internal warehousing
and speed up product to retail.  While our efforts to further
reduce footwear lead times will continue throughout 2003a primary focus will be on reducing apparel manufacturing
lead times by 25% in 2003. 
CUSTOMIZING THE SUPPLY CHAIN /// The creation of customized supply chain solutions is as important as lead-time
reduction.  These activities enable us to effectively service the
varying needs of our customers and capitalize on unique
market and product opportunities.  Over the past two yearswe have successfully executed tailored programs for over
500000 pairs of shoes across 15 different models including
products such as the SL2 running shoe and the T-MAC
basketball shoe.  In 2003,  we will also introduce customized
supply chain solutions in apparel.  Lead times have been
reduced by as much as two-thirds,  helping us capitalize on
immediate market opportunities.  In addition to bringing
incremental top-line growth to our business,  these
programs are also significantly enhancing our service to
key retailers.  We believe this business model is scalable
and can be used to drive ongoing growth.  In the future,  we
will not only continue to offer retailers the existing solutionsbut will put resources into developing these programs even
further to meet more specific needs and create a sustainable
competitive advantage.

Sustainability /// WE ARE DEDICATED TO FOLLOWING
AND ENCOURAGING BUSINESS PRACTICES THAT ARE
SOCIALLY AND ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE.  THIS
APPROACH APPLIES BOTH TO THE GROUP'S OWN ACTIVITIES AND TO ITS SUPPLY CHAIN.  WE BELIEVE THAT THIS
WILL ALLOW US TO ESTABLISH A SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS
MODEL,  WHILE ENHANCING THE VALUE OF OUR BRANDS. 

SETTING STANDARDS /// adidas-Salomon's own code of
conduct,  the Standards of Engagement (SOE),  is based on
the conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO)
and the model code of conduct of the World Federation of
the Sporting Goods Industry (WFSGI).  The SOE details our
requirements regarding labor,  health,  safety and environmental issues in our suppliers' factories and forms the foundation
for our international factory-monitoring program. 
ENSURING COMPLIANCE /// Our department for Social and
Environmental Affairs (SEA) works to ensure that best practices are being followed.  The SEA team is comprised of
30 experts with specialized knowledge of the labor laws and
safety regulations in the countries where they work.  SEA
team members visit suppliers at factory and subcontractor
level internationally and locally to monitor and determine
compliance levels and identify common problems,  with
particular emphasis on facilities which have been identified
as high-risk.  Risk assessments cover a variety of factorsincluding product type,  number of workers,  record of compliance and commitment to standards.  During 2002,  1148 audits
involving management and worker interviews in their native
languages or with a local translator,  document review and
facility inspections were conducted at different levels in our
supply chain.  In the event of non-compliance with our SOEfactory management together with our SEA team develops
action plans and sets deadlines for compliance and further
improvements.  If a factory persistently fails to meet SOE
standards,  business relations are terminated.  This course of
action is a last resort and occurred 14 times in 2002.  However,  whenever possible,  adidas-Salomon prefers to stay in
partnership and to work from the inside to help encourage
factory improvements.

VERIFYING RESULTS /// Through our membership in the Fair
Labor Association (FLA),  an independent monitoring organization headquartered in the US,  adidas-Salomon externally
verifies the Group's global compliance activities.  The FLA
completed its first year of factory monitoring in August 2002by which time more than 220 external audits were verified by
FLA monitors,  including 42 external audits at adidas-Salomon
contracted factories. 
TRAINING AND EDUCATION /// We believe that the best way
to enforce compliance with our SOE is by providing constant
training,  communication and consultation for our suppliers'
management and their workers.  In 2002,  our level of compliance training was consistently maintained at the same high
level as the previous year. 
MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS /// We consider management
systems important to our ability to anticipate and meet growing social,  environmental,  health and performance expectations.  Because of this,  we actively encourage our business
partners to pursue the opportunity for certification with
internationally recognized standards such as those of the
International Standardization Organization ISO 9000 and
14001 for quality and environmental management and OHSAS
18000 (Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series). 
At our production site in Scheinfeld,  Germany,  we established
an environmental and quality management system that
obtained a certificate in accordance with the Environmental
Management and Audit Scheme of the European Union
(EMAS II) and ISO 9000.  The adidas Suzhou factory,  part of
our subsidiary in China,  received ISO 14001 certification in
2002.  There are three footwear suppliers' factories in Asia
certified to OHSAS 18000 and ISO 14001.  Additionally,  several
suppliers in the Americas gained ISO 9000 and ISO 14001
certification in 2002. 

INCREASING INVOLVEMENT /// We actively and systematically cooperate with our numerous stakeholders,  involving
them in key social and environmental decisions so that we
can best balance interests,  build consensus and enhance the
transparency of our business.  December 2001 marked our first
formal stakeholder meeting,  held in Hong Kong with several
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in attendance. 
Expanding on this experience,  we organized two stakeholder
meetings in 2002: one in Europe and one in North America. 
We invited participants from other companies,  trade associations,  trade unions,  social investment funds,  sustainability
institutes,  universities,  certification organizations,  and various
NGOs involved in human rights to participate.  Each meeting
was moderated and recorded by independent facilitators. 
RECOGNITION /// adidas-Salomon is an industry leader on
sustainability issues.  In 2002,  after thorough analysis by Dow
Jones of the Group's social,  environmental and financial
performance,  adidas-Salomon was included in the Dow Jones
Sustainability Group Index (DJSGI) for the third consecutive
year.  The DJSGI is a global sustainability index,  which tracks
the performance of leading sustainability-driven companies. 
adidas-Salomon was additionally included in the FTSE4Good
Europe Index,  which selects companies on the basis of
ongoing commitment to environmental sustainability,  strong
financial performance,  a positive relationship with stakeholders and dedication to upholding and supporting human rights. 
More information regarding sustainability topics can be

 DIVERSE MIX OF BACKGROUNDS /// We believe that having
 varied cross-section of cultures,  ages and backgrounds
represented within adidas-Salomon strengthens our Group. 
44% of total employees are women and 56% are men,  with
20% women and 80% men having executive management
positions.  At our headquarters in Herzogenaurach,  we have
more than 300 international employees from over 40 countries.  And to ensure the Group's closeness to the main target
group,  our employees are young: The average age is 33.  This
pattern holds true for the whole Group.  The majority of our
employees work at brand adidas.  Production activities at
Salomon,  however,  elevate their number of employees. 
Regionally,  the employee split largely reflects the Group's
proportion of sales.  Despite our diverse backgrounds,  what
unites all adidas-Salomon employees is our passion for
competition and a sporting lifestyle. 
REWARDING PERFORMANCE /// To ensure our continued
ability to attract,  motivate and retain the best people,  we
undertake considerable efforts in devising appropriate compensation plans.  The most important step in terms of compensation in 2002 was the implementation of a homogeneous
compensation philosophy and structure across the Group. 
Internal evaluations and external benchmarking form the
basis for the global harmonization of our compensation
programs.  Despite the relative youth of our employees,  the
average length of service is six years.  This proves that our
efforts are delivering results. 

COMMITTED TO LONG-TERM CAREER DEVELOPMENT ///
At adidas-Salomon,  we believe that education and learning
are critical to the long-term success of our Group.  With
personnel /management development programs,  we strive to
ensure that our employees continue to grow and learn.  These
programs include management training courses,  as well as
'future leader programs" such as 'Campus Europe" that
will commence in 2003 and provides management training
to promising talents within Europe.  We also attach great
importance to the education of young employees.  At our
headquarters in Germany,  for example,  38 apprentices and
15 trainees are currently enjoying solid,  diverse and international 'on the job" training in various departments and
divisions of the adidas-Salomon Group. 
Our programs are supported by internal and external
providers for training as well as e-learning tools.  In 2002,  we
implemented an Internet-based learning program giving our
employees worldwide the possibility to independently improve
their computer skills focused on their specific needs.  These
courses are very popular amongst our employees.  As a
result,  we intend to extend this program to other areasincluding language courses which hold high priority at
adidas-Salomon.

BALANCING WORK AND HOME LIFE /// Different people have
different needs especially when it comes to balancing their
work and private responsibilities.  To meet the requirements
of different personal and job-related needs,  adidas-Salomon
has developed a flexible working hours model 'Flexitime A

the basic certificate for the 'Occupation and Family Audit"
awarded by the non-profit Hertie Foundation in Germany.  We
are continuing to work on a number of initiatives in this area
including the implementation of our 'Work-Life Balance

APPRECIATION AND OUTLOOK /// 2002 was an exciting year
in which,  despite tough markets,  adidas-Salomon achieved
tremendous results.  The Management would like to thank all
employees for their magnificent support,  cooperation and
commitment this year.  In addition to the programs mentioned
above,  important Human Resources priorities in 2003 include
formalizing succession planning within the Group and further
rolling out our HR system solutions.

Executive Board Statement ///
The Executive Board of adidas-Salomon AG is responsible for the compilation,  completeness and
accuracy of the Group's annual consolidated financial statements,  the description of the economic
development and the management discussion and analysis as well as the other information
presented in the annual report.  The consolidated financial statements 2002 were prepared in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) adopted by the International
Accounting Standards Board (IASB).  The consolidated financial statements also comply with
§ 292a German Commercial Code (HGB),  which exempts adidas-Salomon AG from the obligation of
reporting consolidated financial statements under German GAAP.  The management discussion and
analysis additionally complies with the requirements of the German Commercial Code (HGB). 
To ensure accuracy and reliability of the underlying information,  the content of the consolidated
financial statements is based on the information reported in accordance with Group-wide uniform
guidelines which are consistent for all companies included in consolidation.  The integrity of the
reporting process and risk management systems is safeguarded by effective internal control
systems established under the direction of the Executive Board which is in compliance with the
German Act regarding the Control and Transparency of Company Divisions (KonTraG).  As a
consequence,  a true and fair view of the Group's financial position,  results of operations and cash
flows and its reporting thereon is assured and the Executive Board is in a position to recognize
potential investment risks and negative developments at an early stage and take appropriate
countermeasures. 
In accordance with a resolution adopted by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in
2002,  KPMG Deutsche Treuhand-Gesellschaft Aktiengesellschaft WirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaftFrankfurt,  was appointed as independent auditor to audit adidas-Salomon's consolidated financial
statements and management discussion and analysis contained in this annual report. 
The Supervisory Board examines the consolidated financial statements,  the management
discussion and analysis as well as the audit report at its meeting on the annual consolidated financial statements.  The results of these reviews are described in the supervisory board report.

Independent Auditor's Report ///
We have audited the consolidated financial statements,  comprising the consolidated balance sheetthe consolidated income statement and the notes to the consolidated financial statements and the
statements of changes in shareholders' equity as well as cash flows prepared by adidas-Salomon
AG for the business year from January 1 to December 31,  2002.  The preparation and the content of
the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are the responsibility of the Company's Management.  Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with German
auditing regulations and German generally accepted standards for the audit of financial statements
promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW).  Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit such that it can be assessed with reasonable assurance whether the consolidated
financial statements are free of material misstatements.  Knowledge of the business activities and
the economic and legal environment of the Group and evaluations of possible misstatements are
taken into account in the determination of audit procedures.  The evidence supporting the amounts
and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements is examined on a test basis within the
framework of the audit.  The audit includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by Management,  as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated
financial statements.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In our opinion,  the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the net assetsfinancial position,  results of operations and cash flows of the adidas-Salomon Group for the business year in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. 
Our audit,  which also extends to the group management report prepared by the Company's
Management for the business year from January 1 to December 31,  2002,  has not led to any reservations.  In our opinion on the whole the group management report provides a suitable understanding of the Group's position and suitably presents the risks of future development.  In addition,  we
confirm that the consolidated financial statements and the group management report for the
business year from January 1 to December 31,  2002 satisfy the conditions required for the
Company's exemption from its duty to prepare consolidated financial statements and the group
management report in accordance with German law.

 /// GENERAL
The accompanying consolidated financial statements of adidas-Salomon AG (in the following also
the 'Company") and its subsidiaries (collectively the 'adidas-Salomon Group",  'adidas-Salomon" or
the 'Group") are prepared in accordance with accounting principles adopted by the International
Accounting Standards Board (International Financial Reporting Standards 'IFRS" formerly IAS).

Eight subsidiaries have not been included in the consolidated financial statements in 2002
(2001: nine subsidiaries),  since they have no or little active business and are insignificant to the
financial position,  results of operations and cash flows.  The shares in these companies are
accounted at cost. 
 schedule of the shareholdings of adidas-Salomon AG is shown in Attachment I to these
notes.  A collective listing of these shareholdings in accordance with § 285 No. 11 and § 313 section
 and 3 of the German Commercial Code will be filed with the Commercial Register at the Local
Court in Fürth (Bavaria). 
Consolidation of equity is made in compliance with the book value method by offsetting the
initial investments in subsidiaries against the relevant equity portion at fair value held by the parent
company as at acquisition date. 
All significant intercompany transactions and balances,  and any unrealized gains and losses
arising from intercompany transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial
statements. 

Currency Translation
Assets and liabilities of the Group's non-euro functional currency subsidiaries are translated into
euro at closing exchange rates at the balance sheet date.  Revenues and expenses are translated at
the average exchange rates for the year.  All cumulative differences from the translation of equity
of foreign subsidiaries resulting from changes in exchange rates are included in a separate caption
within shareholders' equity without affecting income. 
In the individual financial statements of Group companies,  monetary items denominated in a
foreign currency are generally measured at closing exchange rates at the balance sheet date.  The
resulting currency gains and losses are recorded directly in income. 
 summary of exchange rates to euro for major currencies in which the Group operates is as

Effective January 1,  1999 the European Monetary Union commenced and the exchange rates
between the participating currencies and the euro were irrevocably fixed.  On January 1,  2002 the
euro officially replaced the local currency in all European Monetary Union countries. 
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments,  interest and currency options,  as well as forward
contracts,  to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks.  In accordance with its
treasury policy,  the Group does not hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. 
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognized in the balance sheet at cost and subsequently measured at their fair value.  The method of recognizing the resulting gain or loss is
dependent on the nature of the item being hedged.  On the date a derivative contract is entered intothe Group designates certain derivatives as either a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset
or liability (fair value hedge),  a hedge of a forecasted transaction (cash flow hedge) or a hedge of a
net investment in a foreign entity. 

Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedgesand that are 100% effective,  are recognized in equity.  If there is no 100% effectiveness,  the deviating
amounts are recognized in net income.  Amounts deferred in equity are transferred to the income
statement in the same periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects the income
statement.  For derivative instruments designated as a fair value hedge,  the gain or loss on the
derivative and the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item are recognized immediately in net
income. 
Certain derivative transactions,  while providing effective economic hedges under the Group's
risk management policies,  do not qualify for hedge accounting under the specific rules of IAS 39. 
Changes in the fair values of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting
under IAS 39 are recognized immediately in the income statement. 
Hedges of net investments in foreign entities are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. 
If the hedging instrument is a derivative (e.g.  a forward contract) or for example a foreign currency
borrowing,  any currency gains and losses in the derivative and all gains and losses arising on the
translation of the borrowing are recognized in equity. 
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging
instruments and hedged items,  as well as the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.  This process includes linking all derivatives designated as
hedges to specific forecasted transactions.  The Group also documents its assessment,  both at the
hedge inception and on an ongoing basis,  whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items. 
The fair values of forward contracts and currency options are determined on the basis of the
market conditions on the reporting dates.  The fair values of interest rate options on the reporting
date are assessed by the financial institutions through which these options had been arranged. 
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents represent cash and short-term,  highly liquid investments with maturities of three months and less. 
Receivables
Receivables are stated at nominal amounts less allowances for doubtful accounts.  These
allowances are determined on the basis of individual risk assessment and past experience of
losses. 

121

Inventories
Merchandise and finished goods are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value.  Costs are
determined using a standard valuation method which approximates the first-in,  first-out method
or the average cost method.  Costs of finished goods include cost of raw materials,  direct labor and
manufacturing overheads.  The lower of cost or net realizable value allowances are computed
consistently throughout the Group based on the age and expected future sales of the items on hand. 
Property,  Plant and Equipment
Property,  plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.  Depreciation is
computed on a declining balance or straight-line basis on useful lives as follows:

Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets
Acquired goodwill and intangible assets are valued at cost less accumulated amortization. 
Goodwill is the excess of the purchase cost over the fair value of the identifiable assets and
liabilities acquired.  Goodwill arising from the acquisition of a foreign entity and any fair value
adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities of that foreign entity are treated as
assets of the reporting entity and are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the date of the
initial consolidation. 
Amortization is calculated on a straight-line basis with the following useful lives:

Expenditures for internally generated intangible assets are generally expensed as incurred
since they do not qualify for recognition. 
Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.  Significant renewals and
improvements are capitalized. 
Investment Property Held for Sale
Investment property held for sale is measured initially at cost.  For the subsequent measurement
the Group applies the cost model. 
Impairment
In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the costs of long-lived assets are impairedan evaluation of recoverability is performed.  An exceptional write-down is made if the carrying
amount exceeds the recoverable amount. 
Finance Leases
If under a lease agreement substantially all risks and rewards associated with an asset are transferred to the Group,  the asset less accumulated depreciation and the corresponding liability
are recognized at the fair value of the asset or the lower net present value of the minimum lease
payments. 

122 FINANCIAL ANALYSIS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (IFRS) /// NOTES

Research and Development
Research costs are expensed as incurred.  Development costs are also expensed as incurred and
are not capitalized due to the short product life cycle of sporting goods. 
The Group spent approximately € 85 million and € 86 million on product research and development for the years ending December 31,  2002 and 2001 respectively. 
Investments
The Group classifies its investments into the following categories: trading,  held-to-maturity and
available-for-sale. 
During the reporting period the Group did not hold any trading or held-to-maturity investments. 
Investments intended to be held for an undefined period of time,  which may be sold in
response to liquidity needs or changes in interest rates,  are classified as available-for-sale.  These
are included in other non-current assets and in cash and cash equivalents. 
Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of the
purchase and re-evaluates such designation on a regular basis. 

All purchases and sales of investments are recognized on the trade date.  Costs of purchases
include transaction costs.  If the fair value of available-for-sale investments can be measured
reliably,  they are subsequently carried at fair value.  Realized and unrealized gains and losses
arising from changes in the fair value of these investments are included in the income statement in
the period in which they arise.  Equity securities for which fair values cannot be measured reliably
are recognized at cost less impairment. 
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognized initially at the proceeds received,  net of transaction costs incurred.  In
subsequent periods,  borrowings are stated at amortized cost using the effective interest method. 
Any difference between proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognized
in the income statement over the terms of the borrowings. 
Other Liabilities
Other liabilities are recorded at their settlement amount. 
Provisions
Provisions are recognized where a present legal or constructive obligation has been incurred
which is likely to lead to an outflow of resources which can be reasonably estimated. 
Pensions and Similar Obligations
Provisions for pensions and similar obligations comprise the provision obligation of the Group
under defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans.  The obligation under defined benefit
plans is determined using the projected unit credit method in accordance with IAS 19 (revised
2000).  The Group does not recognize actuarial gains or losses of defined benefit plans as income
and expenses according to the corridor approach of IAS 1992 (revised 2000) within the range of
10% of the present value of the defined benefit obligation. 
Recognition of Revenues
Sales are recorded net of returns,  discounts,  allowances and sales taxes when title passes based
on the terms of the sale. 
Royalty and commission income is recorded based on the terms of the contracts. 
Advertising and Promotional Expenditures
Production costs for media campaigns are shown under prepaid expenses until the advertising
takes place for the first time,  after which they are expensed in full.  Significant media buying costs
(e.g.  broadcasting fees) are expensed over the original duration of the campaign on a straight-line
basis. 

Promotional expenses,  including one-time upfront payments for promotional contracts,  are
expensed pro rata over the term of the agreement. 
Interest
Interest is recognized as an expense or income as incurred. 
Income Taxes
Current income taxes are computed in accordance with the rules for taxation established in the
countries in which the Group operates. 
The Group computes deferred taxes for all temporary differences between the carrying amount
and the tax basis of its assets and liabilities and tax loss carryforwards. 
Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences and tax loss carryforwards
which exceed taxable temporary differences are only recognized to the extent that it is probable that
the company concerned will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the associated benefit. 
Equity Compensation Benefits
Share options are granted to members of the Executive Board of adidas-Salomon AG as well as to
the Managing Directors/Senior Vice Presidents of its affiliated companies and to further senior
executives of the Group in connection with the management share option plan (MSOP) of adidasSalomon AG.  The Company has the choice to settle a possible obligation by issuing new shares
or a cash compensation.  When the options are exercised and the Company decides to issue new
shares,  the proceeds received net of any transaction costs are credited to share capital and capital
surplus,  and no personnel expenses are recorded.  In the case of a cash settlement,  the difference
between the exercise price and the fair value of the shares are debited to income. 
Long-term Incentive Plans
The Group has established various long-term incentive plans which offer key employees a stockbased compensation,  including stock appreciation rights ('SARs").  Compensation costs for the
difference between the exercise price and the fair value of the SARs is recognized in the financial
statements when the SARs are exercised. 
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of assumptions
and estimates that affect reported amounts and related disclosures.  Although these estimates are
based on Management's best knowledge of current events and actions,  actual results ultimately
may differ from those estimates.

 /// FRAMEWORK FOR ACCOUNTING POLICIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH IFRS AND EXPLANATION
OF MAJOR DIFFERENCES COMPARED WITH GERMAN ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The major differences between the accounting policies and consolidation methods according to
IFRS and German law as set out in § 292a section 2 No.  4b) of the German Commercial Code (HGB)
are outlined below. 

Deferred Taxes
Deferred tax assets must be included to their full extent.  This also applies to tax loss carryforwards
which can be offset against future profits for tax purposes and which are thus to be reflected as
deferred tax assets.  Deferred tax assets are to be reviewed for their realization regularly and are to
be written down if appropriate. 

a) Framework for Accounting Policies in Accordance with IFRS
The accounting policies of entities in accordance with IFRS are based on the objective of providing
investors with decision-relevant information. 
Based on the assumption that decision-relevant information should be provided to investors,  it
follows that accounting policies should be aimed at showing an entity's operating results,  rather
than determining the amount of distributable profits whilst bearing in mind the need for protection
of creditors. 
As a rule,  accounting policies in accordance with IFRS have a lower level of prudence than
German accounting policies,  which leads to the following major differences:
> Minimization of possibilities for establishing and releasing hidden reserves;
> The consistency requirement (recognition,  valuation,  classification,  consolidation) is to be strictly
followed; changes in accounting policies are only permitted if it can be proven that the change
leads to an improvement in the fair presentation of the financial statements;
> Economic substance has precedence over legal form.  The principle of substance over form has a
stronger influence in accounting policies in accordance with IFRS than in German GAAP. 

Pension Provisions
Pension provisions are to be calculated actuarially using the projected unit credit method.  Use
of the German tax-based entry-age-normal method (§ 6a German Income Tax Act EStG) is not
permitted. 
Expected wage and salary increases until pensionable age are to be considered when calculating the pension liability to beneficiaries under the scheme.  Capital market interest rates are to
be used to discount the amounts,  which can partly offset this increase,  as the rate can be higher
than the 6% used for tax purposes in Germany (§ 6a EStG).  Pension provisions are to be calculated
for beneficiaries as soon as they become scheme members.  Appropriate fluctuation rates should
be used when considering the provisions needed for this group of beneficiaries. 

b) Description of Major Differences in Accounting Policies Compared with German Accounting
Policies
The major differences in accounting policies in accordance with IFRS compared with German
accounting policies in the consolidated financial statements of the Group are as follows:
Unrealized Profits Included in the Income Statement
Although the realization principle is a specific part of IFRS,  in contrast to German accounting
policies 'unrealized" profits must be included in the income statement in certain cases.  The following balance sheet items are translated at foreign exchange rates ruling at the end of the year even
if this leads to an 'unrealized" profit compared with using the exchange rate at the booking date:
> Foreign currency receivables and liabilities;
> Derivative financial instruments to the extent they do not represent a hedge;
> Available-for-sale securities. 

124 FINANCIAL ANALYSIS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (IFRS) /// NOTES

Other Provisions and Accruals
Provisions and accruals may only be set up to cover obligations to third parties.  Internal accruals
are not permitted. 
Accounting for Leases
In contrast to the use of German tax-based leasing provisions,  IFRS requirements more often
lead to leased items being recognized in the balance sheet of the lessee rather than of the lessor. 
IFRS requires the contractual party which is the economic owner and which thus has the major
share of risks and opportunities arising from use of the item being leased to recognize the lease in
its balance sheet. 
Minority Interests
Minority interests may not be included as part of Group shareholders' equity in the consolidated
balance sheet.  They must be shown as a separate item between third-party capital and shareholders'
equity.

Depreciation expense was € 84 million and € 80 million for the years ending December 312002 and 2001 respectively. 
Prepaid expenses relate mainly to promotion agreements and service contracts. 
Investment property held for sale relates to parts of the land of the former 'Herzo Base" in
Herzogenaurach.  This land was bought in 1998 and is owned by the GEV Grundstücksgesellschaft
Herzogenaurach mbH & Co.  KG.  The part to be sold is not needed in the future by adidas-Salomonthe remaining portion is being used for the adidas-Salomon international headquarters 'World of
Sports",  which is included under property,  plant and equipment.  The area to be sold is currently
lying idle and has a size of 77 hectares.  According to the 'Urban Design Contract",  signed with the
town Herzogenaurach in December 2001,  the land is to be split in a housing area (31 hectares),  an
industrial area (19 hectares),  a public area (24 hectares) and other areas (3 hectares).  The fair value
of this investment property cannot be determined reliably at the current time as the land is not yet
developed,  and a binding land-use plan and building permits do not yet exist.  However,  the Group
estimates that the range of the fair value for the undeveloped land could be up to € 50 million. 
To secure an appropriate market value,  the Group decided in 2002 to pursue development and
commercialization under the control of GEV Grundstücksgesellschaft mbH & Co.  KG based on the
results of the economic evaluations during the concept phase. 
Information regarding forward contracts as well as currency and interest options is also

service contracts (see also notes 29 and 20). 
Financial assets include a 10% participation in FC Bayern München AG of € 77 million which
was concluded in July 2002.  This participation is recorded at cost including transaction costsas this equity security does not have a quoted market price in an active market and other methods
of reasonably estimating fair value as at December 31,  2002 are inappropriate or unworkable.

13 /// BORROWINGS AND CREDIT LINES
Despite the decrease of borrowings in 2002,  it has been the policy of the Group to continue the high
level of financing agreements,  with further improvement in the quality and maturity profile of these
arrangements.  The Group has continued its diversification among different sources of financing
and succeeded in increasing its funding through private placements to € 560 million (2001: € 225
million),  with maturities of up to 10 years.  The global on-balance-sheet asset-backed security (ABS)
program,  under which € 147 million were outstanding at the end of 2002 (2001: € 155 million)was extended for another year to maintain a remaining life of five years. 
Gross borrowings declined in 2002 by € 192 million while the longer-term credit facilities
were increased by € 441 million.  As all borrowings with short-term maturities which are backed
by longer-term arrangements are reported as long-term borrowings,  the Group no longer reports
short-term borrowings.  Long-term borrowings include bank borrowings,  commercial paper,  financing under the ABS program and private placements. 
Under the € 750 million German multi-currency commercial paper program and the
€ 300 million Belgian treasury notes program,  the Group had a total nominal amount outstanding
of € 234 million at December 31,  2002 (2001: € 280 million). 
Borrowings are denominated in a variety of currencies in which the Group does business.  The
largest portions of effective net borrowings (before liquidity swaps for cash management purposes)
as at December 31,  2002 are denominated in euro (542%; 2001: 571%) and US dollars (297%;
2001: 310%). 
Month-end weighted average interest rates on borrowings in all currencies ranged from 30 to
34% and from 33 to 53% for the years ending December 31,  2002 and 2001 respectively. 
As at December 31,  2002 the Group had cash credit lines and other longer-term financing
arrangements totaling € 35 billion (2001: € 34 billion); thereof unused credit lines accounting
for € 19 billion (2001: € 17 billion).  In addition,  the Group had separate lines for the issuance of
letters of credit in an amount of approximately € 06 billion (2001: € 07 billion). 

127

The committed medium-term credit lines as well as the private placement documentation
contain a negative-pledge clause and a minimum equity covenant.  As at December 31,  2002,  actual
shareholders' equity was well above the amount of the minimum-equity covenant. 
The amounts disclosed as borrowings represent outstanding borrowings under the following
arrangements with aggregated expiration dates as follows:

In 2002,  the Group contracted a sale and leaseback transaction which resulted in an operating
lease.  In this context,  a one-time profit of € 8 million was realized within selling,  general and
administrative expenses. 
Finance Leases
The Group also leases several premises for administration,  warehousing,  research and development as well as production,  which are classified as finance leases. 
The net carrying amount of these assets of € 10 million and € 12 million is included in property,  plant and equipment as at December 31,  2002 and 2001 respectively.  Interest expense was
€ 1 million (2001: € 1 million) and depreciation expense was € 3 million (2001: € 3 million) for the
year ending December 31,  2002. 
The minimum lease payments under these contracts over their remaining terms which extend
up to 2011 and their net present value are as follows:

21 /// FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Management of Foreign Exchange Risk
The Group is subject to currency exposure,  primarily due to an imbalance of its global cash flows
caused by the high share of product sourcing invoiced in US dollars,  while sales other than in US
dollars are invoiced mainly in European currencies,  but also in Japanese yen,  Canadian dollars and
other currencies.  It is the Group's policy to hedge identified currency risks arising from forecasted
transactions when it becomes exposed.  In addition,  the Group hedges balance sheet risk selectively. 
Risk management is conducted by using natural hedges and arranging forward contractscurrency options and currency swaps.  At an early stage in the decline of the US dollar in spring
2002,  the share of options was significantly increased to create more potential for utilizing benefits
from the expected further decline. 
In 2002,  the Group contracted currency options with premiums paid in a total amount of
€ 122 million (2001: € 31 million).  As currency options serve as cash flow hedges for future product transactions,  the related premiums are recorded in income at the same time as the underlying
transaction is recorded.  The total amount of option premiums,  which was charged to income in
2002,  is € 40 million (2001: € 137 million).  Paid option premiums (as part of the total capitalized
fair value) in an amount of € 114 million and € 23 million were deferred as at December 31,  2002
and 2001 respectively. 
The total net amount of US dollar purchases against other currencies is unchanged at
$ 12 billion in the years ending December 31,  2002 and 2001 respectively. 

The total increase is mainly due to the increased use of short-term swaps to optimize the
Group's cash management (€ 81 million increase year-over-year). 
Out of the total amount of outstanding hedges,  the following contracts relate to the coverage
of the biggest single exposure,  the US dollar:

The decrease in fair values is the result of the US dollar vs.  euro development from 088
(December 31,  2001) to 105 (December 31,  2002) which in turn has a beneficial impact on future
product costs.  Out of the negative fair value of € 100 million of forward contracts,  € 140 million
relate to hedging instruments falling under hedge accounting as per definition of IAS 39,  split into a
negative fair value of € 157 million from cash flow hedges and a positive fair value of € 17 million
from net investment hedges.  The total fair value of outstanding currency options relates to cash
flow hedges. 
The fair value adjustments of outstanding cash flow hedges for forecasted sales will be reported in the income statement when the forecasted sales transaction is recorded,  the wide majority
being forecasted for 2003.  A minority of cash flow hedges refers to an embedded derivative within a
specific contract and will be transferred from equity to the income statement at specified payment
dates up to 2008 as per the contract.  The embedded derivative is not separated from the host
contract,  as the economic characteristics and risk of the embedded derivative are closely related to
the host contract.  Other significant embedded derivatives do not exist at the balance sheet date. 
In addition,  adidas-Salomon hedges part of its net investment in Salomon & Taylor Made Co. Ltd.,  Tokyo (Japan) with forward contracts.  A related gain of € 14 million in 2002 is recognized in
equity. 
Management of Interest Rate Risk
It has been the policy of the Group to concentrate its financing on short-term borrowings,  but to
protect against liquidity risks with longer-term financing agreements,  and to protect against the
risk of rising interest rates with interest rate caps.  In view of the continuing decline of the borrowings,  no additional caps were arranged in 2002. 
As part of a low-cost resetting strategy of euro caps with expiration dates in the years 2006 and
2007 to lower protected interest rates,  the Group sold floors in the notional amount of € 04 billion
with an average strike rate of 36% in 2001.  To prevent possible opportunity losses from these floors
in an environment of generally declining interest rates,  the floors were widely neutralized with
offsetting transactions at an average rate of 32% in the course of 2002. 
The interest rate hedges which were outstanding at the end of 2002 and 2001 respectively
expire as detailed below:

Operating expenses include expenses for sales,  marketing and research and development,  as well
as for logistics and central finance and administration.  In addition,  they include depreciation on
tangible and amortization on intangible assets,  with the exception of goodwill amortization and
other depreciation and amortization which is included in the cost of sales. 
 significant part of the operating expenses comprises the Marketing Working Budget.  The
Marketing Working Budget consists of promotion and communication spending such as promotion
contracts,  advertising,  retail support,  events and other communication activities,  however it does
not include marketing overhead expenses.  For the year 2002,  Marketing Working Budget accounted
for approximately 35% (2001: 35%) of the total operating expenses. 
Total depreciation and amortization expense for tangible and intangible assets (except for
goodwill) was € 114 million and € 108 million for the years ending December 31,  2002 and 2001
respectively.  Thereof € 17 million and € 18 million were recorded within the cost of sales as they
are directly attributable to the production costs of goods sold.

Above instruments had a negative fair value of € 3 million and a positive fair value of € 1 million

Some of the instruments qualify as cash flow hedges pursuant to IAS 39.  The related negative
change in fair value of € 4 million was debited in equity and will be expensed according to interest
rate developments in parallel to the underlying hedged item.  The negative change in the fair
value of the remaining instruments of € 2 million was recorded directly in the income statement,  as
incurred.

In general,  adidas-Salomon AG and its German subsidiaries are subject to corporate and trade
taxes. 
From January 1,  2001 onwards a corporate tax rate of 25% plus a surcharge of 55% thereon
is applied to earnings.  The corporate tax rate will be temporarily increased to 265 % for 2003 in
order to help to support the victims of the floods in Eastern Germany in 2002.  The municipal trade
tax is approximately 15% of taxable income,  which is deductible in the determination of income
for corporation tax purposes.  The Group uses a blended tax rate of 38% and 37% for the measurement of future consequences of temporary differences related to its German operations which
affect 2003 and 2004 and beyond respectively.

Deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that the realization of the related benefit
is probable.  Based on the past performance and the prospects of the respective business for the
foreseeable future,  valuation allowances are established where this criterion is not met. 
Valuation allowances refer to deferred tax assets of companies which are operating in the
start-up phase or certain emerging markets,  since the realization of the related tax benefits is not
probable.  Further,  adidas Salomon North America Inc.  has tax loss carryforwards,  which can in
part only be utilized in limited annual amounts through to 2007,  for which a valuation allowance is
established for amounts in excess of income projections. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if they relate to the same fiscal authority.  Hence

The Group does not recognize deferred tax liabilities for unremitted earnings of non-German
subsidiaries to the extent that they are expected to be permanently invested in international
operations.  The earnings could become subject to additional tax if they were remitted as dividendsor if foreign earnings were loaned to the subsidiary,  or if the Group were to sell its shareholdings in
the subsidiaries. 
The Group estimates that the distribution of these earnings in their entirety would have
resulted in € 7 million and € 9 million of additional withholding taxes as at December 31,  2002 and
2001 respectively.

NOTES ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
27 /// SEGMENTAL INFORMATION
The Group operates predominately in one industry segment,  the design,  wholesale and marketing of athletic and sports lifestyle products.  The Group is currently managed by brands and on the
basis of a regional structure. 
Certain functions of the Group are centralized and an allocation to specific segments is not
considered to be meaningful.  This includes mainly central treasury,  worldwide sourcing and global
marketing as well as other headquarter departments.  Assets,  liabilities,  income and expenses
relating to these corporate functions are presented in the Headquarter/Consolidation column
together with non-allocable items and the intersegment elimination. 
Compared to the 2001 annual financial statements,  the aggregation of the segments has been
reorganized.  In accordance with Management responsibility and internal reporting,  Mavic is no
longer reported as a separate segment category.  The Mavic brand is now included in Salomon. 
At the beginning of January 2002,  the Group took over distribution and licensing rights for the
Maxfli and Slazenger Golf brands from the Dunlop Slazenger Group.  Sales and earnings from
these brands are included in the TaylorMade-adidas Golf segment.  In December 2002,  the Group
purchased the Maxfli brand (see also note 11),  whereas the distribution and licensing rights for
Slazenger Golf were terminated. 
In addition,  the Group took over the brand Arc'Teryx (see also note 4) which is reported under
the Salomon segment.

Net sales to third parties are shown in the geographic market in which the revenues are
realized.  Intersegment sales represent sales to operational units not belonging to the same region;
the global sourcing function is shown in the Headquarter/Consolidation column.  There are no sales
between the brands. 
Transactions between the segments are based on the dealing-at-arm's-length principle. 
Segment assets include all operating assets and comprise mainly accounts receivable,  inventory,  property,  plant and equipment as well as intangible assets.  Segment liabilities comprise
operating liabilities and consist principally of trade and other payables and accrued liabilities and
provisions.  Non-allocable items include goodwill,  financial assets,  assets and liabilities relating to
income taxes and borrowings,  which are included in the Headquarter/Consolidation column. 
Capital expenditure,  amortization and depreciation relate to segment assets; the acquisition of
goodwill and the inception of finance leases do not affect capital expenditure.

Management Stock Option Plan (MSOP) adidas-Salomon AG
On May 20,  1999 the Annual General Meeting resolved to increase the nominal capital of adidasSalomon AG conditionally by up to € 3500000 through the issuance of not more than 1367187
no-par-value shares (Contingent Capital I) for the granting of stock options to members of the
Executive Board of adidas-Salomon AG as well as to the Managing Directors/Senior Vice Presidents
of its affiliated companies as well as to further senior executives and executives of adidas-Salomon
AG and of its affiliated companies.  On May 8,  2002,  the shareholders resolved to extend the term
of the subscription rights granted under the stock option plan to up to five years. 
Under the stock option plan adopted by the shareholders of adidas-Salomon AG on May 201999 and amended by resolution of the Annual General Meeting on May 8,  2002,  the Executive
Board has been authorized to issue non-transferable stock options for up to 1367187 no-par-value
bearer shares to the above-mentioned persons including the Executive Board until August 27,  2004. 
The granting of stock options can take place in tranches that shall not exceed 25% of the total
volume for each fiscal year. 
There is a two-year vesting period for the stock options and a term of approximately five years
upon their respective issue. 
The following stock options have been issued so far:

The stock options can only be exercised subject to the attainment of at least one of the following performance objectives. 

(1) Absolute Performance:
During the period between the issue and exercise of the stock options,  the stock market price for
the adidas-Salomon share calculated upon the basis of the Total Shareholder Return Approach –
has increased by an annual average of at least 8%. 
(2) Relative Performance:
During the same period,  the stock market price for the adidas-Salomon share must have developed
by an annual average of 1% more favorably than the stock market prices of the major competitors
of adidas-Salomon globally and in absolute terms may not have fallen. 
The stock options can only be exercised against payment of the exercise price.  The exercise
price corresponds to the arithmetical mean of the closing prices of the adidas-Salomon share
over the last 20 trading days of the respective exercise period,  less a discount,  which is composed
of the absolute and relative performance components.  In any case,  the exercise price shall be at
least the lowest issue price as stated in § 9 section 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG)currently € 256. 
The option terms and conditions stipulate that the stock options can be used for existing
common shares in lieu of new shares from the contingent capital,  or in the place of common shares
the discount is paid in cash.
