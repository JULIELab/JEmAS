ⅷ PRESIDENT'S LETTER

What a year !

In 1996,  adidas surged past records of
business growth as well as consumer and
trade acceptance.  It's a tribute to adidas
people worldwide,  and we are proud of their
achievement last year,  as well as of their
commitment to build upon that momentum. 
Together,  we will maintain our momentum
towards achieving our mission to be the
best sports brand in the world. 

In 1996,  fans everywhere couldn't miss
adidas as they watched their favorites on the
field.  The year was an outstanding year for
adidas in the sports arenas,  as the company
consistently worked to create opportunities
for brand visibility on the international sports
scene.  Thousands of athletes wearing the
adidas colors successfully took part in the
top championships worldwide: Germany
triumphed at soccer's Euro '96 wearing
head-to-toe adidas outfits,  and over 220
medals were won at the Olympic Games in
Atlanta by athletes who chose adidas as
their brand for footwear and/or apparel.  To
further enhance brand visibility in soccer and
track and field,  adidas signed on as Official
Sponsor and Licensee of the FIFA World
Cup FRANCE '98 and the International
Amateur Athletic Federation.  In signing on for
soccer's World Cup,  adidas made history as
the first-ever sponsor of this event in the
sports brand category,  assuring it unique
and universal visibility for what is expected
to be the world's most-watched sports
event this century.  To ensure continuing
visibility in all fields,  adidas scouted and
signed exceptional young athletes including
Kobe Bryant in basketball,  Anna Kournikova
in tennis and Alessandro del Piero in soccerthe promising sports stars of the future. 

The year 1996 also marked an exciting turning point in our product history with the


launch of the Feet You Wear footwear range. 

The philosophy behind Feet You Wear is
simple and powerful: based on the fundamental observation that the foot is at its
best in its natural state,  adidas designed a
shoe which offers athletes the biomechanical properties of the foot in a high-performance shoe.  The current range,  which

breakthroughs remains strong and enduring. 
It is a heritage that will continue to power its
trajectory in the marketplace race worldwide.

it belongs in the top league at the very

heritage and our motivation.  That tradition –

That is also the meaning behind our new

There couldn't have been a more striking
demonstration of adidas' continuing commitment to excellence in sport than the threestripe brand's vivid and visible presence at
Atlanta's Olympic Games in the summer of
1996.  The Games also provided an ideal
podium for adidas' Olympic champions'
product testimonials in the truest sense of 
brand mission as 'the best sports brand in
the world" in the eyes of the world's champions.  Outside the Olympic arena,  a major
advertising campaign featured all-time favorite Olympic champions,  bringing images of
adidas' unique Olympic heritage to millions
of homes around the world.  The campaign
struck a chord of the continuity of adidas'
Olympic heritage.  It did so by linking Olym

ⅷ ADIDAS IN THE SPORTS ARENA:



 H E R E A D I D A S I S AT H O M E

In 1996,  adidas demonstrated,  perhaps
more than ever before,  why its name
truly is synonymous with sports.  The
brand and its products were present
all over the world's best sports fieldsin addition to the Summer Olympic
Games,  and on the most promising
athletes.  Because adidas helped make
sports history in 1996,  it's worth reviewing those twelve months,  sport by sport:

Soccer Euro '96: adidas outfitted five
teams in this event,  and was once again
able to associate its name with that of a
grand winner when Germany took home the
coveted trophy after a thrilling final against
the Czech Republic.  The new Predator and
Traxion shoes and the eye-catching new
jerseys worn by many of the players on the
field gave adidas visibility; the win gave
adidas even more credibility as the world's
top soccer brand. 

adidas' image also was reinforced by
 powerful pan-European advertising campaign 
featuring 
favorite 
adidas 
soccer 
players,  such as England's Paul GascoigneItaly's Alessandro del Piero,  France's Marcel
Desailly and Germany´s Matthias Sammer. 

In the fall,  we made history with the
announcement that adidas would become
the first-ever sports brand to be an Official
Sponsor of the World Cup FRANCE '98.  In
addition,  adidas became a World Cup supplier and licensee.  So,  not only will adidas be
visible as the World Cup sports brand at
what should be the most-watched sporting
event of this century,  our associations create
an array of business opportunities with
licensed products.  The first licensed products already hit the French market before
Christmas 1996,  and the big international
rollout will start with the Spring/Summer
1997 collection.

the development of athletics on a worldwide

 GIANT STEP AHEAD

Why is it that simple ideas seem so
ingenious? It's often because the creative
ideas that work best require a genius to turn
them into reality; that's the hard part. 

Adi Dassler,  the founder of adidas,  was one
of those geniuses who knew how to tame
the devil in the detail to make great ideas
work the way he imagined. 

Adi Dassler was so passionate about sport
that he dedicated his life to imagining
sports shoes that would enable athletes
to perform better by helping the foot a
perfectly calibrated mechanism to work as
it was designed to do.  Shoes like the Copa
Mundial,  Handball Spezial or Grand Slam
followed the foot's own design.  Another
example is adidas' 'Torsion' design,  which
allows the forefoot and heel to act independently in the same way as the foot itself
moves.  In fact,  the 'Torsion' concept is the
forerunner to adidas' giant step forwardFeet You Wear,  launched in 1996,  and
already a success. 

Feet You Wear is based upon a simple
observation: the foot in its natural state is the
athlete's optimal 'footwear',  whether torsionning,  bending,  pushing,  revolving,  or
gripping the ground.  The ultimate sports
shoe is one that will enhance the foot's function without altering it in any way.  Feet You
Wear is adidas' answer to the challenge.  It is
the product of a total comprehension of the
foot's function plus a thorough understanding of athletes' requirements,  translated into
 unique design through technological innovation applied creatively.

Feet You Wear is a no-frill,  pure-performance
shoe,  which,  we know from our testing,  both
in the lab and on the field,  makes a difference to the athlete.  The difference is not only
in fit and comfort but in actual athletic performance and safety.  In fact,  Feet You Wear
is demonstrating once again the wisdom in
adidas' design philosophy that form should
follow function. 

The success of Feet You Wear with the

followed by more products in other athletic
categories.  The Equipment Top Ten 2000

and proximity to the surface,  any athlete will
feel more confident and perform better. 
What's more,  because the Feet You Wear
design supports the natural contours of the
foot,  instead of trying to supplement its function,  it should reduce ankle,  knee and hip
problems as well as reducing injuries created
by imperfect foot support during lateral
athletic movement. 

Tennis players were the first to take advantage of Feet You Wear,  with the launch of the

the campaign is getting athletes to experience Feet You Wear and we know that the
intrinsic qualities of the shoe will convince
them to wear them when in competition.

WHERE FORM ALSO FOLLOWS FUNCTION

Given last year's successful track record of
sales of adidas shoes,  we're particularly
pleased that our apparel sales grew even
faster in 1996; in fact,  apparel was adidas'
fastest-growing product category over the
past three years.  In 1996,  apparel sales
grew by 51% year-over-year.  This strong
performance was the product of two unique
adidas competitive advantages: unmatched
expertise in the functional sports textiles
sector plus a big boost from the adidas
brand name. 

One of the best examples of this process
was the challenge faced by adidas to provide world champion athletes with apparel
for the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlantawhere heat and humidity combine to create
difficult conditions for the athletes.  How do
you design and manufacture apparel for top
athletic performance under those conditions? To adidas,  the challenge was transformed into an opportunity for product
development.  New fabrics,  designs and
details were tested on the tracks by athletes
over an 18-month period.  The resulting

apparel extends our brand leadership in
clothing and this,  in turn,  allows us to
increase R&D to sustain that lead.  In a
word,  success breeds success. 

Quality,  of course,  must be produced at
marketplace prices.  And adidas is committed to producing the highest-quality products that give the best value.  To keep the 
Or,  put another way,  quality breeds success. 
And to get that quality in apparel,  we rely on
that same simple yet powerful idea that has
been the basis of adidas products from
the beginning 'form follows function".  We
apply this philosophy to a true understanding of the athlete's requirements that we
know are constantly evolving.  We design
fabrics and garments which represent the
ultimate for sport and for athletes because 
quality built in at affordable cost,  we continually aim to be more productive,  to reduce
lead times and expenses,  and,  overall,  to
improve all aspects of sourcing.  Improvements in 1996 include the consolidation of
the apparel sourcing process (60% in Asia40% in Europe) and its rationalization,  including the opening of a sourcing office in
Istanbul,  to achieve even better FOB prices
and margins. 

they are made to be at the leading edge
of innovation and technical excellence.  In
short,  we create quality and style for top
performance from day one. 

All of this so that,  when the three-stripes
are worn worldwide,  both adidas and the
consumer can be prouder than ever.

1996 AS A LANDMARK YEAR

If any year can be said to be a landmark in
adidas' recent history,  1996 was it.  The past
year witnessed a real adidas renaissance in
every sense of the term a powerful relaunch of the brand in the eyes of the world. 
This gave it an increased momentum that we
aim to maintain and even speed up.  Everywhere you looked,  the adidas brand was
there twelve months of exceptional visibility
on the international sports scene,  and on the
international media scene in general. 

Today,  adidas has consolidated its activities
around two key operational functions –
marketing and sourcing and around four
market regions (Europe,  North AmericaAsia/Pacific,  Latin America),  fully dedicated
to sales,  distribution and trade marketing. 
The growth is carefully orchestrated by
increasing size and productivity of sourcing
and marketing,  and by continuing to expand
the international network of subsidiaries
(e.g.  in South Korea).  To that end,  we
increased the number of employees world
This wasn't by chance.  We generated that
momentum through a number of announcements,  launches,  campaigns,  and events. 
There was the launch of integrated communication campaigns around Euro '96 and 
wide,  from just over 5700 in 1995 to just
about 7000 at the end of 1996.  And we
expect our '97 business growth to be supported by a staff addition of up to 1000 new
people in the course of the year. 

the Centennial Olympic Games,  the official
announcement of the World Cup '98 sponsorship,  the launch of the Feet You Wear
range of footwear,  just to name a few of the
activities that marked our adidas year.  These
across-the-board successes translated into
exceptional financial growth: double-digit
increases in net sales (+35%) and income
before taxes (+50%),  and a palpable feeling
of motivation and enthusiasm throughout the
organization.

all generate the drive,  creativity and ingenuity
that can lead to corporate success.  However,  achieving that success depends on
management's ability to channel that energy
toward clear and attainable goals through the
motivation of a sense of shared mission and
 vision of the way to get there.  That is precisely how adidas is managing its organization and coaching its teams: to win.  And the
year's results measure just how well adidas
has been succeeding in the last couple of
years. 

We are fully aware of what it takes to get to
the top.  We must sustain growth in sales
and profit,  reinforce financial strength,  and
increase shareholder value.  We must also
provide a secure working environment that
will attract,  motivate,  develop and keep the
best people.  Yet,  if we are to assume the
role of a real leader,  we must go beyond
quantitative business measurements of today

of the countries in which we operate. 

adidas has a brand mission that provides

achieved.

Product marketing will focus on innovative
high-performance footwear and apparel,  with
particular emphasis on the landmark Feet
You Wear line of products.  Although we produce products for many sports,  the core categories will be soccer,  running,  basketballtennis and training,  with additional developments aimed at the women's and kids'
segments.  Product marketing will benefit
from above-industry-average spending on
R&D,  a level of 25% of footwear net sales. 

Communications will be made more productive.  In an environment of an everincreasing spiral of inflation in the promotional investment circuit,  we will concentrate
on key symbols and messages.  Promotional
activities will be centered around these symbols and be leveraged by a combination of
creative advertising and public relationsextensive merchandising,  and large-scale
grass root programs.  The Feet You Wear
concept will be the focal point of our overall
communication effort,  with an additional
boost from the World Cup '98 sponsorship
which will gain importance as the event
approaches. 

Sourcing is at the heart of our business,  and
an essential lever to reduce FOB prices and
optimize our service level to subsidiaries and
customers.  Strategies in 1997 will include
consolidating and enhancing partnerships
with key suppliers in footwear and in apparel. 
We will continue to reduce lead times by
securing a highly flexible and higher-technology factory base in Asia for footwear and will
also source an increasing amount of apparel
close to our major markets. 

We have specific strategic objectives in mind
for the different regions.  In Europe,  we want
to reinforce leadership in Germany and push
for share growth in all other major countries. 
In North America,  we will continue to drive
marketshare in some of our core categoriesespecially running,  and to revitalize basketball to reflect its importance in America and
worldwide.  In Asia/Pacific,  we will capitalize
on market growth and pursue our jointventure efforts by concluding current business partnership projects including those in
Japan,  as well as by improving existing ventures.  Finally,  in Latin America,  we will
strengthen the regional organization by reinforcing management in key countries and

We all are committed to these clearly defined

ADIDAS AG AND SUBSIDIARIES
 O T E S T O C O N S O L I D AT E D F I N A N C I A L S TAT E M E N T S

adidas AG,  a German stock corporation,  and its subsidiaries design,  develop and market a broad range of athletic and
active lifestyle products,  consisting of athletic footwear,  apparel and accessories primarily under the tradename adidas
and also under the tradename erima.  The Company's headquarters are located in Herzogenaurach,  Federal Republic
of Germany. 

1.  General 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements of adidas AG and its subsidiaries (collectively the 'Company") are prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted by the International Accounting Standards Committee
('International Accounting Standards") and comply with the Company's significant
accounting policies described herein. 

2.  Summary of significant 
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the con
accounting policies 
solidation,  accounting and valuation principles described below.  As compared to
the previous year,  these principles have been applied consistently in all material
respects. 

Principles of consolidation:
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of adidas AG and its
significant direct and indirect subsidiaries.  The Company's investments in other
companies are accounted for at cost.  All significant intercompany transactions and
accounts are eliminated in consolidation. 
Consolidation of equity is made in compliance with the book value method by offsetting the initial investments in subsidiaries against the relevant equity portion held
by the parent company as at acquisition date. 
 schedule of the shareholdings of adidas AG is shown in attachment I to these notes. 

Goodwill and intangible assets:
Goodwill and intangible assets are valued at cost less accumulated amortization. 
Goodwill resulting from the excess of the acquisition cost over the fair value of the
net assets of businesses acquired in purchase transactions and intangible assets
are amortized over their expected useful economic lives up to 20 years.  Goodwill
and intangible asset amortization expense of DM 20 million,  DM 17 million and
DM 11 million for the years ended December 31,  1996,  1995 and 1994,  respectivelyis included in depreciation and amortization. 
Goodwill primarily relates to the Company's acquisitions in the United StatesAustralia/New Zealand and South Korea as described in Note 3. 

45

Research and development:
Research costs are expensed as incurred.  Development costs are also expensed as
incurred and are not capitalized due to the short product life cycle of the fashion
industry.  These costs are also not significant to the Company's financial position. 
The Company spent approximately DM 374 million and DM 353 million on product
research and development in 1996 and 1995,  respectively. 

Currency translation:
Assets and liabilities of the Company's non-Deutsche-Marks functional currency
subsidiaries are translated into Deutsche Marks at closing exchange rates at
the balance sheet date.  Revenues and expenses are translated at the average
exchange rates for the year.  All cumulative differences resulting from changes in
exchange rates are included in shareholders' equity. 
 summary of exchange rates used to translate the financial statements of the
Company's subsidiaries to Deutsche Marks for major currencies in which the Company operates is as follows:

Realized and unrealized gains and losses arising from forward contracts,  options
and interest rate caps are recognized in financial expenses (Note 14) and cost of
sales,  respectively.  Gains and losses related to qualifying hedges of firm commitments are deferred. 

Inventories:
Finished goods are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value.  Costs are
determined using a standard valuation method which approximates the first-infirst-out method or the average cost method.  The lower of cost or net realizable
value allowances are computed consistently throughout the Company based on the
age and expected future sales of the items on hand. 

46

Property and equipment and depreciation:
Property and equipment are stated at cost.  Depreciation is computed on a declining
balance or straight-line basis based on useful lives ranging from 2 to 50 years as
follows:

Depreciation Rates
Buildings
Leasehold improvements
Equipment,  machinery and furniture and fittings 
2% to 10%
5% to 20%
10% to 50%

The cost of maintenance and repairs is charged to expense as incurred.  Significant
renewals and betterments are capitalized. 

Recognition of revenues:
Revenues are recognized when title passes based on the terms of the sale.  Sales
are recorded net of returns,  discounts and allowances. 

Advertising and promotional expenditures:
The Company recognizes advertising expenses as incurred or the first time the
advertising takes place.  Promotional expenses are recorded in the period incurred
or expensed ratably over the terms of the agreements. 

Income taxes:
Income taxes are computed in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the countries in which the Company operates. 
The Company recognized deferred tax liabilities for differences between the financial
reporting and tax basis of its assets and liabilities. 
Deferred tax assets including assets relating to net operating loss carryforwards
are recognized only to the extent that there is a reasonable expectation of their
realization in the period when they arose. 

3.  Acquisitions and
divestitures 
In 1994 and 1995,  the Company acquired the remaining minority interest of adidas
North America,  Inc.  The purchase costs in excess of the proportionate share of the

shareholders approved,  effective January 1,  1995,  the merger of adidas International Holding GmbH (aIH),  a company controlled by Sogedim S. A.,  Belgium,  into

companies adidas Australia and adidas New Zealand through the acquisition of the
remaining interest.  The purchase price totalled DM 77 million.  The purchase costs in

allocated to goodwill of adidas AG.

–

By resolution of a meeting of the shareholders on October 20,  1995,  the shareholders of the Company approved the adoption of new articles of association for
adidas AG.  Such new articles of association had the effect of reducing the existing
par value of common shares from DM 50 to DM 5 per share and increasing the
authorized and issued share capital and common shares from DM 147800000 to
DM 226746000 and 2956000 shares to 45349200 shares,  respectively.  In
addition,  the articles of association authorized the Board of Directors through
September 1,  2000 to increase the nominal value of the share capital,  subject to the
approval of the Supervisory Board,  by a maximum amount of:
a)

DM 83700000 for cash consideration with the right of existing shareholders to
subscribe for the shares;

b)

DM 22600000 for cash consideration which,  with the consent of the Supervisory Board,  shareholders can be excluded from the subscription of shares; and 
c)

DM 7000000 for cash consideration or contribution-in-kind for the purpose of
granting the right to subscribe shares to key management. 

51

Further,  the articles of association removed certain restrictions on the transferability
of the Company's common shares.  These resolutions were entered into the trade
register on October 25,  1995. 
Sogedim S. A.,  the Company's former principal shareholder,  no longer owns a
majority of the shares,  but still holds more than 25% of the Company's common
shares.

52

Earnings available for dividend distributions are determined by reference to the

as follows (in thousands):

Dividend of DM 110 per ordinary share 
DM 49884

The remaining balance is to be carried forward to the new year

DM 349459

Unappropriated earnings as of December 31,  1996

DM 399343

The Company leases space for its offices,  warehouses and equipment under leases
expiring from one to nine years.  Rent expense aggregated DM 61 million,  DM 49
million and DM 53 million for the years ended December 31,  1996,  1995 and 1994respectively.  Amounts of future minimum lease payments under significant noncancellable operating leases for the succeeding five years 1997 through 2001 are
approximately DM 51 million,  DM 33 million,  DM 23 million,  DM 14 million and DM 9
million,  respectively.  Amounts of future minimum lease payments after 2001 are
approximately DM 13 million. 
Additionally,  the Company conducts a portion of its operations from leased facilities
in France.  The lease,  which is for fifteen years expiring in 2004,  is classified as a
capital lease.  The value of facilities under this capital lease,  net of accumulated
depreciation,  of approximately DM 5 million and DM 5 million at December 31,  1996
and 1995,  respectively,  is included in land,  land rights,  and buildings.  The future
minimum lease payments under this capital lease,  which are payable through the
year 2004,  amounted to approximately DM 3 million at December 31,  1996. 

13.  Employee benefit plans 
The Company sponsors and/or contributes to various pension plans,  primarily in
Germany.  The Company's plans cover substantially all German employees.  The
liabilities related to these plans of approximately DM 38 million and DM 27 million at
December 31,  1996 and 1995,  respectively,  are included in other long-term
liabilities.  The aggregate amounts vested in Germany under these plans were DM 10
million and DM 9 million at December 31,  1996 and 1995,  respectively.  Additionallythe Company borrowed approximately DM 17 million at December 31,  1996 and
1995,  respectively,  from its pension trust fund in Germany.  This amount is also
included in other long-term liabilities.  As of January 1,  1996,  this amount bears
interest at the average Deutsche Bundesbank public bond rate of 546% as fixed at
the beginning of the year.  In 1995,  the amount had an interest rate at the German
discount rate plus 2%.  The Company's plans include both defined contribution
plans and defined benefit plans as described below. 

53

The Company sponsors and contributes to a defined benefit plan in Germany.  The
employee benefits of this plan are based on years of service.  Pension costs are
generally funded currently,  subject to German regulatory funding limitations.  The
pension accruals of adidas AG were calculated actuarially using the projected unit
credit method in accordance with International Accounting Standards.  Measurement of the projected benefit obligation was based on a discount rate of 7% and
75% in 1996 and 1995,  respectively,  and an expected compensation growth rate
between 22% and 3%.  Additionally,  the Company sponsors and contributes to a
defined contribution plan in Germany for certain employees.  The Company's
contributions to the plan are determined annually and are allocated to an employee
based on years of service and the employee's compensation.  The actuarial
valuations of the plans described herein are made at the end of each reporting
period.  The actuarial valuations of the plans are dated November 25,  1996 and
December 12,  1996. 
Additionally,  the Company sponsors and/or contributes to various other plans outside of Germany which are not significant. 
Pension expense totalled DM 13 million,  DM 14 million and DM 8 million for the
years ended December 31,  1996,  1995 and 1994,  respectively. 

14.  Financial instruments 
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to market
risks resulting from fluctuations in currency exchange and interest rates.  The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 

Management of foreign exchange risk:
The Company is subject to currency exposure due to a high share of sourcing
from suppliers in the Far East which invoice in USD,  and the majority of its sales in
European countries. 
It is the Company's policy to hedge currency risks due to future operations when
it becomes exposed.  Up to and including 1996,  such hedging occurred when
the Company communicated its prices for a new selling season to its customers. 
Reacting to the appreciation of the USD primarily versus the Continental European
currencies and the Japanese Yen in recent months,  the Company has modified its
hedging policy to permit the hedging for a period up to a maximum of two years. 
In principle,  the Company manages its currency exposures centrally from the headquarters in Herzogenaurach. 

54

The Company uses forward contracts,  primarily for the shorter maturities,  and currency options in the management of its currency risks.

Deferred gains and losses on forward contracts are not significant. 

Management of interest rate risks:
Since the Company's product sourcing is principally from outside suppliers,  most of
its financing concerns inventories and receivables.  Taking advantage of lower shortterm rates of most major currencies,  the Company has concentrated its borrowings
in short maturities,  but it has reduced its exposure with regard to possible future
interest rate increases with the purchase of interest rate caps for a basket of currencies in a structure which approximates the currency composition of its worldwide
borrowings.  These contracts protect the Company's borrowings in a notional amount
of DM 100 million against a rise of the weighted average interest rate above 625%up to a limit of 975%.  If interest rates rise above the upper rate limit,  the protection
ends at this upper rate limit.

Fair value of financial instruments:
The carrying amount of cash,  cash equivalents and borrowings approximates fair
value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.  The fair value of forward
exchange contracts and currency options were determined on the basis of the
market conditions on the reporting date.  The fair value of the interest rate caps on
the reporting date was assessed by the financial institutions which these caps had
been arranged with. 

Credit risk:
The Company arranges its currency and interest rate hedges,  and it invests its cash
with major banks of a high credit standing throughout the world,  and in high quality
money-market instruments.  The Company has not incurred any related losses.

The Company's operations in a multitude of currencies resulted in net exchange
gains in 1996,  a year in which many of the major currencies gained strength as
compared to the Deutsche Mark,  while the years 1995 and 1994 were characterized
by a weakening of major currencies as compared to the Deutsche Mark. 

15.  Income taxes 
The Company computes its income tax liabilities in accordance with International
Accounting Standards No.  12.  The Company's corporate statutory tax rates were
48375% (45% plus 75% surtax thereon),  48375% and 45% for the years ended
December 31,  1996,  1995 and 1994,  respectively.  In addition,  the Company's
statutory trade tax rate was 14%.  The statutory trade tax is deductible for corporate
tax purposes.  The Company's effective tax rates were 240%,  145% and 203% for
the years ended December 31,  1996,  1995 and 1994,  respectively.  The differences
between statutory and effective tax rates result primarily from earnings in jurisdictions
taxed at rates different from statutory German rates and the benefits of prior year
operating loss carryforwards of adidas AG realized in the current years. 
During the period ended December 31,  1996,  the Company realized net deferred
tax assets previously unrecognized,  principally from net operating loss carryforwards
(approximately DM 114 million). 
The cumulative amounts of unremitted earnings of international subsidiaries are
expected to be required for use in the international operations.  At December 311996,  little or no tax liability would result upon remittance of these earnings. 
The Company netted the tax effect of certain temporary differences between the
book value of the Company's assets and liabilities and the related tax bases of those
assets and liabilities including the effect of the operating loss carryforwards as of
December 31,  1996 and 1995 (Note 2). 

56

The Company had unrecognized deferred tax assets from operating loss carryforwards of approximately DM 284 million and DM 370 million at December 31,  1996
and 1995,  respectively.  The Company's utilization of approximately DM 118 million
of such deferred taxes is substantially limited,  primarily in the US due to a change in
ownership of adidas AG in 1993.  The deferred tax assets from operating loss
carryforwards of adidas AG of approximately DM 151 million at December 31,  1996
have an unlimited carryforward period. 

16.  Segmental information 
The Company operates predominantly in one industry segment,  that being the
design,  wholesale and marketing of athletic and active lifestyle products.  Information
about the Company's operations by geographic markets is presented below.  Revenues are classified on the basis of the Company's geographic reporting structure. 
Sales between geographic regions are at cost plus a sourcing fee.  Inter-geographic
assets were eliminated to arrive at the consolidated amounts.

Due to the Company's internal structure,  specifically where certain central activities
are established and cross-charges between geographic segments result,  the information regarding segment results is not meaningful and,  therefore,  is not included.

17.  Cash flow statement 
Effective October 1,  1996,  the Company acquired 51% of the shares of Jewoo
Trading Co.  Ltd.  in South Korea.  The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities
assumed were as follows:

(in DM 000)
Cash

less: cash of newly consolidated subsidiaries 
(41347)

less: purchase price not yet paid 
(25720)

Cash flow of newly consolidated subsidiaries net of cash acquired 
(41347)

Cash and cash equivalents represent cash and short-term,  highly liquid investments
purchased with maturities of three months or less. 
The increase in cash and cash equivalents from DM 41 million at the end of 1995 to
DM 84 million at the end of 1996 is primarily due to the inclusion of the new joint
venture company Jewoo Trading Co.  Ltd.  (in future adidas Korea),  which held cash
of DM 30 million at the end of 1996.  Furthermore,  Jewoo Trading Co.  Ltd.  held cash
with maturities of 12 months or less in the amount of DM 24 million,  which is
included in other current assets (see Note 5),  and cash with maturities exceeding 12
months in the amount of DM 23 million,  which is included in other long-term assets
(see Note 7).  Totally,  DM 50 million of these DM 77 million was pledged mainly in
support of credit line arrangements. 

18.  Commitments and 
As of December 31,  1996,  the Company has bills discounted in the amount of 
contingencies 
approximately DM 9 million and is contingently liable for guarantees of indebtedness
for liabilities due to banks in the amount of approximately DM 5 million. 
The Company has other financial commitments for promotion and advertising contracts,  together with fixed asset investment commitments for the succeeding five
years 1997 through 2001 of approximately DM 164 million,  DM 131 million,  DM 100
million,  DM 82 million and DM 56 million,  respectively.  Amounts of future payments
after 2001 are approximately DM 62 million.  These commitments have remaining
terms of up to 8 years from December 31,  1996. 

58

The Company is currently engaged in various lawsuits resulting from the normal
course of business.  Although it is reasonably possible that some of the matters
could be decided unfavorably against the Company,  in the opinion of managementthe outcome of the pending lawsuits will not result in a significant impact on the
consolidated financial position as of December 31,  1996. 

19.  Related parties 
Robert Louis-Dreyfus and Christian Tourres,  members of the Board of Directors of
adidas AG,  have indirect influence on the football club Olympique de Marseille. 
Robert Louis-Dreyfus is also the president of this club.  The Company has entered
into promotion contracts with said club.  The promotion contracts are similar to
those entered with other clubs. 

20.  Subsequent events 
The Company will realign its corporate structure in 1997.  In the future,  adidas International B. V.  will be responsible for international license business of the adidas
brand and international promotion activities.

AUDITORS' REPORT

To the Board of Directors and the Supervisory Board
adidas AG
Herzogenaurach,  Germany 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of adidas AG and
subsidiaries (the 'Company") as of December 31,  1996 and 1995,  and the related
consolidated statements of income and cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31,  1996.  These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. 
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatements.  An audit includes examining,  on a test basis,  evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We
believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In our opinion,  the financial statements referred to above present fairly,  in all material
respects,  the consolidated financial position of adidas AG and subsidiaries at
December 31,  1996 and 1995,  and the related consolidated results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December
31,  1996 in accordance with International Accounting Standards.
