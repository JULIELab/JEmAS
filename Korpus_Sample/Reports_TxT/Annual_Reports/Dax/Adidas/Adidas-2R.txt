these events will be accompanied by the associated advertising and promotion activities. 

Despite the Asian currency crisis triggered
by the floating of the Thai baht on July 21997,  net sales in the region increased by
69% to DM 703 million in 1997,  with significant contributions to the growth in net sales
coming from the inclusion of the first full-year
effect of the joint venture company in South
Korea and the subsidiary in Taiwan.  Excluding the effects of new companies,  net sales
in Asia increased by 38%. 

Despite the anticipated negative impact on
sales figures as a result of the Asian currency
crisis and the related increasing pressure on
margins,  in 1998 adidas management is
aiming to achieve the same level of net sales
as in 1997.  This aim is supported by the fact
that the economic crisis is not showing any
appreciable effects in several of adidas' key
countries in the Asia/Pacific region,  such as
Australia,  New Zealand or Hong Kong.

adidas-Salomon AG and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
adidas-Salomon AG (the former adidas AG*),  a German stock corporation,  and its subsidiaries design,  develop and market a
broad range of athletic and active lifestyle products,  consisting of athletic footwear,  apparel and accessories primarily under the
tradename adidas (and also under the tradename erima).  The Company's headquarters are located in Herzogenaurach,  Federal
Republic of Germany. 

1.  General 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements of adidas-Salomon AG and its subsidiaries
(collectively the 'Company") are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted by the International Accounting Standards Committee ('International Accounting
Standards") and comply with the Company's significant accounting policies described herein. 

2.  Summary of significant
accounting policies 
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the consolidationaccounting and valuation principles described below.  As compared to the previous year,  these
principles have been applied consistently in all material respects except the accounting treatment
of unrealized gains and losses on hedging contracts for future commercial transactions (see
note 15).  In order to improve the presentation clarity of the consolidated income statements certain
accounts have been reclassified.  These reclassifications do not individually or together significantly
affect the comparability.  Therefore the respective prior year figures have not been adjusted. 

Principles of consolidation:
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of adidas-Salomon AG and its significant
direct and indirect subsidiaries.  The companies of the Salomon group will be consolidated beginning
January 1,  1998,  the date at which effective control transferred to adidas-Salomon AG.  Further,  a
consolidation in 1997 for the period December 22,  1997 to December 31,  1997 would have been
associated with unreasonably high costs and time constraints and the impact on the consolidated
income statements would have been insignificant with respect to the short period of time. 
The Company's investments in companies not included in consolidation are accounted for at cost. 
All significant intercompany transactions and accounts are eliminated in consolidation. 
Consolidation of equity is made in compliance with the book value method by offsetting the initial
investments in subsidiaries against the relevant equity portion held by the parent company as at
acquisition date. 
 schedule of the shareholdings of adidas-Salomon AG is shown in attachment I to these notes. 

Goodwill and intangible assets:
Goodwill and intangible assets are valued at cost less accumulated amortization.  Goodwill
resulting from the excess of the acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets of businesses
acquired in purchase transactions and intangible assets are amortized over their expected useful
economic lives up to 20 years. 

* The change of the name was registered in the Commercial Register on December 19,  1997. 

35

Research and development:
Research costs are expensed as incurred.  Development costs are also expensed as incurred and
are not capitalized due to the short product life cycle in the fashion industry.  These costs are also
not significant to the Company's financial position. 
The Company spent approximately DM 491 million,  DM 374 million and DM 353 million on product
research and development in 1997,  1996 and 1995,  respectively. 

Currency translation:
Assets and liabilities of the Company's non-Deutsche-Marks functional currency subsidiaries are
translated into Deutsche Marks at closing exchange rates at the balance sheet date.  Revenues
and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates for the year.  All cumulative differences
from the translation of equity of foreign subsidiaries resulting from changes in exchange rates are
included in shareholders' equity without affecting income. 
 summary of exchange rates used to translate the financial statements of the Company's subsidiaries to Deutsche Marks for major currencies in which the Company operates is as follows:

Inventories:
Finished goods are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value.  Costs are determined using
 standard valuation method which approximates the first-in,  first-out method or the average cost
method.  The lower of cost or net realizable value allowances are computed consistently throughout the Company based on the age and expected future sales of the items on hand. 

36

adidas-Salomon AG and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
Property and equipment and depreciation:
Property and equipment are stated at cost.  Depreciation is computed on a declining balance or
straight-line basis based on useful lives ranging from 2 to 50 years as follows:
Depreciation rates
Buildings
Leasehold improvements
Equipment,  machinery and furniture and fittings 
2% to 10%
5% to 20%
10% to 50%

The cost of maintenance and repairs is charged to expense as incurred.  Significant renewals and
improvements are capitalized. 

Recognition of revenues:
Revenues are recognized when title passes based on the terms of the sale.  Sales are recorded
net of returns,  discounts and allowances. 

Advertising and promotional expenditures:
Production costs for media campaigns are shown under prepaid expenses until the advertising
takes place for the first time,  after which they will be expensed in full.  Other media campaign
costs are expensed over the original duration of the campaign on a straight-line basis. 
Promotional expenses,  including one-time upfront payments for promotional contracts,  are
generally expensed pro rata over the whole term of the agreement. 

Income taxes:
Income taxes are computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
countries in which the Company operates. 
The Company recognized deferred tax liabilities for differences between the financial reporting and
tax basis of its assets and liabilities. 
Deferred tax assets including assets relating to net operating loss carryforwards are recognized
only to the extent that there is a reasonable expectation of their realization in the period when
they arose. 
The Company will adopt International Accounting Standard No.  12 (revised 1996) for the fiscal
year beginning January 1,  1998. 
The application of the new standard will result in significantly higher deferred tax assets.  This is
mainly due to the capitalization of deferred tax assets arising from tax loss carryforwards,  which
will be re-assessed in any period subsequent to the loss.  Deferred tax expense will increase
accordingly,  mainly due to the utilization of tax loss carryforwards in Germany.

3.  Acquisitions 
Effective July 1,  1996 adidas assumed full ownership over its former joint venture companies

distributor in South Korea.  The purchase costs (USD 165 million) in excess of the proportionate

11.  Shareholders' equity 
By resolution of a meeting of the shareholders on October 20,  1995,  the shareholders of the
Company approved the adoption of new Articles of Association for adidas AG.  Such new Articles
of Association had the effect of reducing the existing par value of common shares from DM 50 to
DM 5 per share and increasing the authorized and issued share capital and common shares from
DM 147800000 to DM 226746000 and 2956000 shares to 45349200 shares,  respectively.  In
addition,  the Articles of Association authorized the Board of Directors through September 1,  2000
to increase the nominal value of the share capital,  subject to the approval of the Supervisory
Board,  by a maximum amount of:
a)

DM 83700000 for cash consideration with the right of existing shareholders to subscribe for
the shares;

b)

DM 22600000 for cash consideration which,  with the consent of the Supervisory Boardshareholders can be excluded from the subscription of shares; and 
c)

DM 7000000 for cash consideration or contribution-in-kind for the purpose of granting the
right to subscribe shares to key management. 

At the Shareholders' Meeting on May 28,  1997 the shareholders resolved the following change of
the Articles of Association with regard to the capital:
The authorization of the Executive Board,  subject to Supervisory Board approval,  to increase
the stock capital by a maximum amount of DM 7000000 against contributions in cash or in
kind for the purpose of granting shares to employees and to members of the Executive Board
of adidas AG and of its affiliates,  is cancelled and amended to read as follows:
'The Executive Board shall be entitled for the duration of two years from the date of the
registration of § 4 para.  4 of the Articles of Association with the Commercial Registersubject to Supervisory Board approval,  to increase the stock capital by issuing new
shares against contributions in cash or in kind once or several times by no more than
DM 7000000 altogether.  The Executive Board may,  subject to Supervisory Board
approval,  exclude the preemptive rights of the shareholders. "
The Executive Board of adidas AG stated that,  for the next two years,  it shall refrain from utilizing
DM 7000000 of its authorization,  namely to increase the stock capital until September 12000,  subject to Supervisory Board approval,  by issuing new shares against contribution in
cash once or several times,  by an aggregate amount of DM 22600000. 
The amendment of the Articles of Association was sent to the Commercial Register,  however has

12.  Leasing arrangements 
DM 74826

Allocation to revenue reserves 
DM 454467

The Company leases space for its offices,  warehouses and equipment under leases expiring from
one to eight years.  Rent expense aggregated DM 80 million,  DM 61 million and DM 49 million for
the years ended December 31,  1997,  1996 and 1995,  respectively.  Amounts of future minimum
lease payments under significant non-cancellable operating leases for the succeeding five years
1998 through 2002 are approximately DM 65 million,  DM 42 million,  DM 26 million,  DM 15 million
and DM 12 million,  respectively.  Amounts of future minimum lease payments after 2002 are
approximately DM 21 million. 
Additionally,  the Company conducts a portion of its operations from leased facilities in France. 
The lease,  which is for fifteen years expiring in 2004,  is classified as a capital lease.  The value of
facilities under this capital lease,  net of accumulated depreciation,  of approximately DM 4 million
and DM 5 million at December 31,  1997 and 1996,  respectively,  is included in land,  land rightsand buildings.  The future minimum lease payments under this capital lease,  which are payable
through the year 2004,  amounted to approximately DM 2 million at December 31,  1997. 

13.  Employee
benefit plans 
The Company sponsors and/or contributes to various pension plans,  primarily in Germany.  The
Company's plans cover substantially all German employees.  The liabilities related to these plans
of approximately DM 60 million and DM 38 million at December 31,  1997 and 1996,  respectivelyare included in other long-term liabilities.  The aggregate amounts vested in Germany under
these plans were DM 33 million and DM 20 million at December 31,  1997 and 1996,  respectively. 
Additionally,  the Company borrowed approximately DM 17 million at December 31,  1997 and
1996,  respectively,  from its pension trust fund in Germany.  This amount is also included in other
long-term liabilities.  As of January 1,  1997,  this amount bears interest at the average Deutsche
Bundesbank public bond rate of 525% (1996: 546%) as fixed at the beginning of the year. 
The Company's plans include both defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans as
described below. 
The Company sponsors and contributes to a defined benefit plan in Germany.  The employee
benefits of this plan are based on years of service.  Pension costs are generally funded currentlysubject to German regulatory funding limitations.  The pension accruals of adidas-Salomon AG
were calculated actuarially using the projected unit credit method in accordance with International
Accounting Standards.  Measurement of the projected benefit obligation was based on a discount
rate of 7% in 1997 and 1996,  respectively,  and an expected compensation growth rate between
22% and 3%.  Additionally,  the Company sponsors and contributes to a defined benefit plan in
Germany for certain employees.  The Company's contributions to the plan are determined annually
and are allocated to an employee based on years of service and the employee's compensation.

adidas-Salomon AG and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
The actuarial valuations of the plans described herein are made at the end of each reporting
period.  The actuarial valuations of the plan are dated December 10,  1997,  December 11,  1997
and February 10,  1998. 
Additionally,  the Company sponsors and/or contributes to various other plans outside of Germany
which are not significant. 
Pension expense totalled DM 28 million,  DM 13 million and DM 14 million for the years ended
December 31,  1997,  1996 and 1995,  respectively. 

14.  Financial instruments 
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to market risks resulting
from fluctuations in currency exchange and interest rates.  The Company does not enter into
financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 

Management of foreign exchange risk:
Currency management policies of the Group are established by a Treasury Committee which is
composed of members of the Company's senior management.  Currency risk is generally managed
from the Company's headquarters at Herzogenaurach,  Germany. 
The Company is subject to currency exposure,  primarily due to an imbalance caused by the high
share of product sourcing from suppliers in the Far East,  which invoice in USD,  and the majority
of sales being invoiced in European currencies. 
It is the Company's policy to hedge currency risks due to future operations when it becomes
exposed. 
The Company uses forward contracts,  primarily for the shorter maturities,  and currency options
in the management of its currency risks. 
Exchange gains and losses on forward contracts and currency options which hedge anticipated
future transactions are deferred,  whereas exchange gains and losses on forward contracts and
currency options which were discontinued or no longer serve as a hedge for an anticipated future
transaction are credited/charged to current income as incurred. 
To limit the premium payments for currency options,  the Company applies,  in its hedging via optionsa combination of the purchase of USD call options with the sale of USD put options with lower
strike rates.  The Company's portfolio of currency options is actively managed.  In 1997,  the Company incurred option premium payments in a total amount of DM 297 million,  equal to approximately
17% of the total amount of purchases of USD against other currencies,  or approximately 08%
of the cost of goods sold. 
Of the currency hedges in the total amount of DM 17 billion,  which were outstanding on December 31,  1997,  DM 16 billion were for the purchase of USD.  Of these,  approximately DM 400 million
were for the purchase of USD versus DM,  at an effective worst-case rate of 1688.  Since most of
the hedging is via options,  the Company would benefit from a decline of the USD-DM rate in the
exchange markets below this level. 
45

The USD hedges,  which were outstanding on December 31,  1997,  covered approximately 90%
of the USD needs,  which the Company anticipated for the period till the end of October 1998,  i, e. 
till the end of the sourcing for the last selling season in 1998.

The book value of the currency options represents capitalized premiums paid. 

Management of interest rate risks:
As of December 31,  1997,  most of the Company's financing concerned the acquisition of adidas
Salomon France S. A.  (the former Sport Développement S. C. A. ) and the Company's inventories
and receivables.  Taking advantage of lower short-term rates of most major currencies,  the Company has concentrated its borrowings in short maturities,  but it has limited its exposure with regard
to possible future interest rate increases with the purchase of interest rate cap spreads for a basket
of currencies in a structure which approximates the currency composition of its worldwide borrowings.  These contracts protect the Company's borrowings in a notional amount of DM 17 billion
against a rise of the weighted average interest rate above 55%.  Out of this amount,  the protection
ends for DM 13 billion at a weighted average rate of 84%.  The lifetime of these caps ranges from
 to 6 years,  with a weighted average of 4 years.

Fair value of financial instruments:
The carrying amount of cash,  cash equivalents and borrowings approximates fair value due to the
short-term maturities of these instruments.  The fair value of forward exchange contracts and currency options were determined on the basis of the market conditions on the reporting date.  The
fair value of the interest rate caps on the reporting date was assessed by the financial institutions
which these caps had been arranged with. 

Credit risk:
The Company arranges its currency and interest rate hedges,  and it invests its cash,  with major
banks of a high credit standing throughout the world,  and in high quality money-market instruments.  The Company has not incurred any related losses.

In 1996,  unrealized gains and losses due to changes in the fair value of outstanding currency
options,  which hedge future commercial transactions,  were recognized in income as part of net
financial expenses.  With effect from January 1,  1997,  the accounting treatment was changed. 
Unrealized gains or losses on hedging contracts,  which hedge future commercial transactions,  are
now recorded upon maturity of each hedging transaction as part of the cost base of such transactions.  If the Company's 1996 accounting treatment for currency options had been continued
in 1997,  the Company would have accounted for an additional exchange gain on outstanding
currency options in an amount of DM 366 million for the year ended December 31,  1997. 

16.  Income taxes 
The Company computes its income tax liabilities in accordance with International Accounting
Standards No.  12.  The Company's corporate statutory tax rate was 48375% (45% plus 75% surtax thereon) for the years ended December 31,  1997,  1996 and 1995.  In addition,  the Company's
statutory trade tax rate was 15%.  The statutory trade tax is deductible for corporate tax purposes. 
The Company's effective tax rates were 275%,  240% and 145% for the years ended December 311997,  1996 and 1995,  respectively.  The differences between statutory and effective tax rates result
primarily from earnings in jurisdictions taxed at rates different from statutory German rates and the
benefits of prior year operating loss carryforwards of adidas-Salomon AG and of adidas North
America Inc.  realized in the current years. 
During the period ended December 31,  1997 the Company realized net deferred tax assets
previously unrecognized,  principally from net operating loss carryforwards (approximately
DM 129 million). 
The cumulative amounts of unremitted earnings of international subsidiaries are expected to be
mainly required for use in the international operations. 
The Company netted the tax effect of certain temporary differences between the book value of the
Company's assets and liabilities and the related tax bases of those assets and liabilities including
the effect of the operating loss carryforwards as of December 31,  1997 and 1996 (note 2). 

47

The Company had unrecognized deferred tax assets from operating loss carryforwards of approximately DM 185 million and DM 284 million at December 31,  1997 and 1996,  respectively.  The
Company's utilization of approximately DM 36 million of such deferred taxes is substantially limitedprimarily in the US due to a change in ownership of adidas AG in 1993.  Furthermore there are
approximately DM 68 million deferred tax assets in the US which can be utilized within ten years. 
The deferred tax assets from operating loss carryforwards of adidas-Salomon AG of approximately
DM 61 million at December 31,  1997 have an unlimited carryforward period. 

17.  Segmental information 
The Company operates predominantly in one industry segment,  that being the design,  wholesale
and marketing of athletic and active lifestyle products.  Information about the Company's operations
by geographic markets is presented below.  Revenues are classified on the basis of the Company's
geographic reporting structure and since 1997 in the geographic market in which the revenues from
third parties are realized; prior year figures were adjusted accordingly.  Sales between geographic
regions are at cost plus a sourcing fee.  Inter-geographic assets were eliminated to arrive at the
consolidated amounts.

adidas-Salomon AG and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
18.  Cash flow statement 
Cash and cash equivalents represent cash and short-term,  highly liquid investments purchased
with maturities of three months and less. 
Furthermore,  adidas Korea held cash with maturities of 12 months or less in the amount of DM 11
million,  which is included in other current assets (see note 5),  and cash with maturities exceeding
12 months in the amount of DM 7 million,  which is included in other long term assets (see note 8). 
The negative effect of exchange rates on cash is mainly influenced by the devaluation of the Korean
currency in the last quarter of 1997. 

19.  Commitments and
contingencies 
As of December 31,  1997 the Company has bills discounted in the amount of approximately
DM 9 million and is contingently liable for guarantees of indebtedness for liabilities due to banks
in the amount of approximately DM 5 million. 
The Company has other financial commitments for promotion and advertising contracts,  together
with fixed asset investment commitments for the succeeding five years 1998 through 2002 of
approximately DM 237 million,  DM 208 million,  DM 177 million,  DM 147 million and DM 107 millionrespectively.  Amounts of future payments after 2002 are approximately DM 124 million.  These
commitments have remaining terms of up to 8 years from December 31,  1997. 
The Company is currently engaged in various lawsuits resulting from the normal course of business. 
Although it is reasonably possible that some of the matters could be decided unfavorably against
the Company,  in the opinion of management,  the outcome of the pending lawsuits will not result in
 significant impact on the consolidated financial position as of December 31,  1997. 

20.  Related parties 
Robert Louis-Dreyfus and Christian Tourres,  members of the Board of Directors of adidas-Salomon
AG,  have indirect influence on the football club Olympique de Marseille.  Robert Louis-Dreyfus is
also the president of this club.  The Company has entered into promotion contracts with said club. 
The promotion contracts are similar to those entered into with other clubs. 

21.  Special Reward and
Incentive Plan (SRIP)

adidas-Salomon AG has implemented a one-time offer share option plan during the second quarter
1997 for certain key-employees and executive board members.  The options can be exercised at
 fixed pre-determined price.  The rights and terms governing the exercise are fixed in the option
agreement.  One half of the options could have been exercised immediately after the implementation of the plan.  The other options are to be exercised in tranches by December 31,  1999.  A total
of 440000 options were granted to exercise the equal number of shares. 
The option plan is sponsored by two shareholders (Robert Louis-Dreyfus and Christian Tourres)
who supply the shares which are required to fulfil the Company's obligation under the plan.  The
shares are made available at a value equal to the exercise price of the options.  The contribution
(being the difference between realized share price and exercise price for options exercised) from
the two shareholders for the year 1997 of DM 21690000 is shown as extraordinary income; the
respective expenses of the same amount are included in the selling,  general and administrative
expenses. 

49

The difference between realized share price and exercise price for options exercised by board
members amounted to DM 4117000. 

22.  Subsequent events 
After the closing of the purchase of the Family Holding Company,  and with the approval of the
French authorities,  adidas Salomon France S. A.  launched in January 1998 a simplified public tender
offer for any and all outstanding shares of Salomon S. A.,  a publicly traded company admitted to
the official market of the Paris Stock Exchange.  The offer price of FRF 52150 in the tender offer
was the same as the implied price per Salomon share paid to the shareholders of the Family
Holding Company.  After the closing of this tender offer in February 1998 the Company has
acquired over 95% of the shares of Salomon S. A.  Under French law the Company has now the
right to launch a going private offer followed by a mandatory repurchase after which Salomon's
shares would be delisted.
