18 THE GROUP

LETTER TO THE SHAREHOLDERS

DEAR SHAREHOLDERS
Truly committed athletes always seem to find a way to win even in the toughest conditions and this certainly
comes to mind when I look at adidas-Salomon's performance in 2003. 
The year started with huge uncertainties globally,  both in the political and financial arenas.  Add to that
exchange rate differentials (especially the euro / US dollar),  which widened continuously throughout the year and
reduced reported sales by over € 300 million,  plus a slowdown in both our North American and Sport Heritage
businesses within brand adidas,  and you get a sense of what we faced in 2003. 
But what I love about adidas-Salomon is that even if not especially in tough times,  we know how to tackle
challenges,  to exploit open opportunities and how to work hard to realize our goals.  In 2003,  that meant creating
 stream of exciting product and marketing news throughout the year as well as taking important operational
steps forward. 
On the product side,  we introduced the ClimaCool® 2 and a3® Twin Strike footwear technologies,  the Roteiro™
football,  the Ellipse™ 100 ski boot and the RAC irons.  All of these innovations are selling through at levels above
our expectations and helped our brands gain important visibility throughout the market. 

19

Helping promote these outstanding products were adidas-Salomon athletes who won countless titles and
medals at the year's most important sporting events.  Highlights included the German national football team
winning the Women's World Cup,  Kim Collins sprinting to victory at the Track and Field World Championshipsand Ian Thorpe taking gold at the World Swimming Championships.  Ivica and Janica Kostelic dominated the
World Skiing Championships,  golfer Mike Weir won the Masters,  number one ranked Justine Henin-Hardenne won
three Grand Slam tennis tournaments and NBA stars Tracy McGrady,  Tim Duncan and Kevin Garnett were top
players in the league. 
We also made important operational strides forward in 2003.  Our successful 'Winning in Europe" program
delivered its first positive results,  with currency-neutral sales in the Group's biggest and most profitable region
increasing 8%.  This is our strongest growth rate in Europe in five years and higher than all our major competitors. 
And the list goes on.  We successfully united Mavic and adidas Cycling to make us one of the few integrated cycling
suppliers in the industry.  We received great response to the launch of our adidas Sport Style collection,  which was
created in cooperation with star designer Yohji Yamamoto.  And we issued a € 400 million convertible bond and a
$ 175 million private placement,  which helped us secure low interest expenses on our long-term borrowings. 
But I don't want to beat around the bush.  2003 also had more than its share of challenges.  Performance at our
adidas business in North America was disappointing.  Sales declined due to the very promotional retail environment and an oversupply of adidas product in some channels.  We also had to deal with a personal setback when
my colleague and fellow Executive Board member Ross McMullin resigned as Head of North America due to health
reasons.  However,  I am pleased that in addition to his Global Marketing responsibilities,  Erich Stamminger has
assumed the position of President and CEO of adidas America.  Erich has the experience and skills needed to make
the US operations perform to the level we know it can. 

Another important topic for us in 2003 was the slowing of our adidas Sport Heritage business,  after significant
growth rates in 2001 and 2002,  where we nearly doubled our sales.  This,  however,  was intended,  as we aimed to
put products into the right channels and markets but to avoid 'overcrowding" in others.  In this way,  we are able to
limit the risk inherent in trend-oriented collections,  which is obviously considerably higher in our Sport Heritage
business than it is for our performance-oriented products.

22 THE GROUP LETTER TO THE SHAREHOLDERS

Despite these obstacles and tough market conditions particularly in the first half of the year,  our financials
clearly indicate that we have made major headway in the past twelve months.  We grew our currency-neutral sales
in 2003 by 5%,  delivered a record gross margin and posted our highest earnings ever.  In addition,  we reduced debt
by more than € 500 million.  These achievements reflect our Group's commitment and ability to continuously
deliver high-quality financial performance. 
Therefore,  it is especially important for me to take this opportunity to thank our employees for their tremendous contribution.  Our achievements in 2003 are a team effort,  and I know we have what it takes to again deliver
strong performance in 2004.  Thanks also to you,  our shareholders,  for your ongoing trust and support. 
We are now concentrating all our efforts on strengthening our position again in 2004.  With the European
Football Championships in Portugal and the Summer Olympics in Athens,  we have two major sporting events
where adidas-Salmon will clearly be positioned at center stage.  We are launching numerous new products and
our first ever global brand campaign entitled 'Impossible is Nothing",  which embodies the spirit we think is most
important in competition and sport.  With our new team in North America,  we are ready to give our competition
 real taste of what adidas means to consumers,  globally.  That means fine-tuning our distribution,  enhancing our
brand message,  and improving our retail presence.  In Europe,  we will expand our market-leading position even
further,  and in Asia and Latin America,  we will continue to grow faster than our competitors.  To sum it all up,  in
2004,  we will strengthen our brands,  grow the bottom line and take all the steps necessary to ensure continued
growth in the future. 
Yours sincerely
Herbert Hainer
Chairman,  Chief Executive Officer
March 2004

Our Share /// AFTER HAVING BEEN THE TOP PERFORMER IN THE DAX-30 FOR TWO CONSECUTIVE
YEARS,  THE adidas-Salomon SHARE HAD ANOTHER
SUCCESSFUL YEAR IN 2003 WITH SHARE PRICE
APPRECIATION OF 10%.  INCREASED ANALYST COVERAGE OF adidas-Salomon IS FURTHER EVIDENCE OF
OUR RECOGNITION WITHIN THE FINANCIAL COMMUNITY.  OUR SUCCESSFUL CONVERTIBLE BOND ISSUE
WAS ALSO WELL RECEIVED BY INVESTORS AND THE
FINANCIAL COMMUNITY.  AND BY SETTING THE
DIVIDEND PAYOUT RATIO WITHIN OUR TARGETED
RANGE WE HAVE AGAIN DEMONSTRATED OUR
ONGOING COMMITMENT TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS
IN 2003. 

STOCK MARKET RECOVERY IN 2003 /// The performance of stock markets worldwide was largely positive
during 2003.  While the majority of shares as well as
major indices developed poorly at the beginning of the
year,  stock markets started to recover in the second
quarter and continued their strong performance towards
the end of the 12-month period.  In addition to an improved economic outlook due to tax cuts and interest
rate reductions in the USA and Europe,  this development
was largely driven by positive corporate news flow over
the last few months.  While the adidas-Salomon share
outperformed both the DAX-30,  Germany's premiere stock
index,  and the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI)
World Textiles,  Apparel & Luxury Goods Index,  which
comprises the Group's major competitors,  in the first
quarter of the year,  company-specific issues dampened
our full year share price development compared with
competitors,  despite improving stock market conditions.

adidas-Salomon SHARE PRICE REMAINS STABLE
IN Q1 /// Uncertainties surrounding the geo-political
situation in the Middle East and a further deterioration
of the global economic outlook put stock markets under
pressure during the first three months of the year.  The
adidas-Salomon share also declined in the first quarter
and reached its year low of € 6953 in February after
several US athletic specialty retailers released disappointing quarterly results.  This decline in the adidasSalomon share price were partially offset by increases
in March,  which were mainly due to our positive final
2002 full year results and hopes for a quick resolution
to the war in Iraq.

US BACKLOG DEVELOPMENT IMPACTS SHARE PRICE
IN Q2 /// While weak economic conditions continued at
the beginning of the second quarter,  the sooner-thanexpected end of the war in Iraq led to improvements for
both the equity market and the adidas-Salomon share. 
However,  this share price appreciation was quickly
eliminated after the release of our first quarter resultswhich included flat adidas backlog development in North
America and disappointed the market given the doubledigit growth rates in previous quarters. 

STRONG SHARE PRICE APPRECIATION IN Q4 /// Most
major indices continued to advance throughout the
fourth quarter due to the improving general global
economic conditions as well as increases in both consumer and business confidence.  The adidas-Salomon
share price also grew strongly during the three-month
period driven by strong quarterly results,  the further
appreciating euro versus the US dollar and the positive
outlook for retailers both in the USA and Europe during
the holiday season.  As a result,  the share price reached
its year high of € 9136 on December 29.  At the end of
the year,  the share price stood at € 9030,  representing
an improvement of 10% compared to the end of 2002. 
The DAX-30 improved 37% during the year and the
MSCI World Textiles,  Apparel & Luxury Goods Index
advanced 44% during the 12-month period.

SHARE PRICE ADVANCES IN Q3 /// During the third
quarter,  the improved economic outlook due to interest
rate reductions in the USA and Europe supported the
general stock market recovery further.  This development
was also underpinned by optimism surrounding government reforms as well as increased consumer confidence
both in the USA and Europe.  The performance of the
adidas-Salomon share remained depressed at the
beginning of the quarter.  While the announcement of
our convertible bond offering led to strong short-term
increases,  information concerning further backlog
deterioration in North America drove a share price
decline at the end of September.

MEMBERSHIP IN HIGH-QUALITY INDICES /// The
adidas-Salomon share is included in a variety of highquality indices around the world which act as indicators
for the development of the respective markets and
regions.  Most importantly,  as one of the 30 largest
exchange-listed companies in Germany,  our share is
included in the DAX-30,  Germany's premiere stock index. 
At the end of 2003,  our share was ranked number 19
(2002: 21) and 23 (18) in the DAX-30 respectively,  as
reported by Deutsche Börse,  according to the two key
criteria,  12-month average equity turnover and market
capitalization.  Our share is also a member of the Dow
Jones STOXX,  the Dow Jones EURO STOXX and the MSCI
World Index as well as all corresponding sector indices. 
In addition,  the adidas-Salomon share has once again
been selected for the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes
in 2003 and is included in the FTSE4Good Europe Index. 
This underlines our ability and determination to combine
 strong financial performance with the commitment to
environmental sustainability,  a positive relationship with
our stakeholders and dedication to supporting human
rights. 
EXTENSIVE AND POSITIVE ANALYST COVERAGE /// In
2003,  more than 40 banks released research reports on
adidas-Salomon on a regular basis.  This represents an
increase versus 2002 and is further evidence of our
recognition within the financial community.  The majority
of these analysts (58%) issued a 'buy" recommendation
for our share in their latest publication during the
12-month period.  Another 36% recommended investors
to 'hold" our share.  Only 6% ranked our share in the
'sell" category. 

32 THE GROUP OUR SHARE

SUCCESSFUL CONVERTIBLE BOND ISSUE /// At the
beginning of October,  we successfully issued a convertible bond with a volume of € 400 million.  It was well
received by convertible investors,  shareholders and the
financial community in general.  This was reflected in the
5% share price increase on the announcement date.  In
addition,  as a result of strong market demand,  we were
able to set the interest coupon at a favorable 25% p, a, thereby capitalizing on the low interest rates available at
the time.  At € 10200,  the conversion price represents a
conversion premium of 40% over the reference share
price of € 7286 on the launch date,  August 27,  2003.  The
bond can be converted into shares upon the occurrence
of certain conditions related to share price performancebond performance and certain events,  such as mergers
and other reorganizations (see note 15).  Trading of the
convertible bond commenced on October 10,  2003 on the
Frankfurt stock exchange. 
€ 100 DIVIDEND WITHIN GROUP'S PAYOUT RANGE ///
The adidas-Salomon Executive Board will recommend
paying a dividend of € 100 for 2003 to our shareholders
at the Annual General Meeting on May 13,  2004.  This
proposal,  which represents a total payout of approximately € 45 million and a payout ratio of 17%,  reflects
our continued commitment to improve the Group's
financial condition while also creating substantial value
for our shareholders.  2003 is the eighth consecutive year
in which,  subject to Annual General Meeting approvalwe were able to meet or exceed the targeted range
defined in our dividend policy,  which recommends a
payout ratio of between 15 and 20% of consolidated net
income. 

INTERNATIONAL CHARACTER OF SHAREHOLDER BASE
CONTINUES TO INCREASE /// Based on the amount of
invitations to our Annual General Meeting in May 2003we currently estimate a total of around 95000 shareholders.  According to our most recent annual ownership analysis conducted in May 2003,  our shareholder
structure has continued to develop towards a more
international ownership base.  Of the known institutional
investors,  which accounted for 82% (2002: 76%) of the
Group's 455 million outstanding shares,  North Americans formed the biggest group.  Their shareholdings
increased to 34% (2002: 31%).  German institutional
investors held 16% of outstanding shares versus 19% in
the prior year.  Other European investors accounted for
28% of adidas-Salomon's shares.  This compares to 22%
in 2002.  Holdings of other international shareholders
remained stable at 4%.  Smaller,  undisclosed holdingswhich mainly include retail investors,  made up 13% of
the shares outstanding (2002: 19%).  adidas-Salomon
Management,  which comprises current members of the
Executive and Supervisory Boards,  continued to hold less
than 5%.  Information regarding Directors' Dealings can
be found in the Corporate Governance section on our
corporate website at www, adidas-Salomon, com. 

INVESTOR RELATIONS ACTIVITIES INCREASE ///
Increasing both the frequency and quality of our dialog
with individual and institutional investors remains a
primary goal for us at adidas-Salomon.  In the course of
2003,  adidas-Salomon's Management and the Investor
Relations team have spoken at many conferences on a
wide variety of topics and held more than 400 one-onones with analysts and institutional investors.  In addition,  we have enhanced our participation in retail
investor presentations and met with different shareholders' representatives on several occasions.  In September
2003,  we invited the financial community to participate in
our fourth annual Investor Day at our headquarters in
Herzogenaurach.  In addition to presenting current
targets and strategies,  the day focused on our latest
innovations,  brand concepts and product lines.  In order
to make this information available to as wide an audience
as possible,  all documents that were presented during
the event are available on our corporate website at
www, adidas-Salomon, com.  In addition,  adidas-Salomon
webcasts all its analyst conferences as well as the
Annual General Meeting live on the Internet.  Archived

Our Strategy /// To achieve our goal of leadership in the sporting goods sectoradidas-Salomon continually focuses on strengthening and developing our brands. 
We aim to maximize consumer impact and enhance brand profitability through the application
of five strategic approaches. 

36 STRATEGY

GROUP STRATEGY

MATCHING OUR STRUCTURE TO OUR CONSUMERS /// Anticipating and fulfilling consumer
desires and needs is central to building powerful brands.  The adidas-Salomon organization
is uniquely structured to ensure that our brand values are intrinsically linked to the
particular expectations and aspirations of our consumers.  This is a deliberate move away
from the traditional industry approach along footwear,  apparel and hardware lines,  and is a
competitive advantage for our Group. 
EXTENDING DESIGN AND INNOVATION LEADERSHIP /// Consumer buying and brand
perception in the sporting goods sector are intrinsically linked to cutting-edge design
coupled with market-leading,  high-profile technologies that capture consumer imagination. 
At adidas-Salomon,  we are committed to keeping our product pipeline full with new,  exciting
designs and technologies.  We plan to launch at least one major new technology or technological evolution per year to excite consumers and demonstrate our leadership in market
innovation.  In 2004,  we are introducing several major new technologies (see Group Management Report / Outlook).  These include the Roteiro™,  the industry's first thermal-bonded
football,  which will premiere at the UEFA EURO 2004™ European Football Championships. 
In addition,  our Ground Control System™ is the first major footwear technology co-developed by adidas and Salomon for adventure products and is based on a unique heel shock
absorption mechanism for uneven surfaces.  We will also introduce the T-MAC 4 Laceless
Footwear Technology,  which brings the first laceless basketball shoe to the market with
exciting design elements. 

ACHIEVING EXCELLENCE IN EXECUTION /// Great products and marketing are vital to
success in our industry,  but sales success often depends on consistent on-time retail
delivery,  ensuring best quality and the ability to go the extra mile for the customer.  We are
particularly focused on improving apparel product quality and delivery.  To this aim,  we have
initiated a new 'Apparel Breakthrough" strategy which utilizes cross-functional teams
throughout the Group to improve performance in this key product category.  Our success in
shortening and customizing the global supply chain,  ensuring best-practice social and
environmental standards and our ongoing commitment to customer service are just a few
examples of our commitment to executional excellence. 
FOCUSING ON FINANCIAL HEALTH /// Our Group knows that while top- and bottom-line
growth is critical to our goal of being the leading sporting goods group in the world,  performance is also measured by other criteria.  The indicators of financial health that are
highest priorities for us include operating margin,  working capital and debt level.  We intend
to make visible improvements to the operating margin in 2004 and believe we can be
among the leaders in the industry in this category over the next three to five years.  Tight
management of working capital continues to be a focus.  And we will further optimize the
Group's financial leverage with continued strides in debt reduction. 

DEVELOPING LEADING POSITIONS IN ALL OUR MAJOR MARKETS /// We are in the business to win.  We aim to have number one or number two positions in all the markets and
categories in which we compete.  On a regional basis,  our efforts start in Europe,  where we
will extend our leadership position with our 'Winning in Europe" program to drive both
top- and bottom-line growth for the coming years.  In North America,  our goal is to deliver
top-line currency-neutral growth at all our brands and increase market share significantly
in the next three to five years.  In Asia,  we are striving to become the market leader with
top positions in the region's major markets.  And in Latin America,  our goal is to continue
our status as the fastest growing sporting goods supplier over the next five years.

IMPOSSIBLE IS NOTHING: adidas' ATTITUDE DRIVES YEAR-LONG BRAND CAMPAIGN ///
adidas started 2004 with a year-long brand campaign that focuses on one of the key elements that unite adidas with athletes around the world the desire to surpass limitsenhance performance and achieve the impossible.  The fully integrated communication
campaign comprises TV,  print and outdoor executions as well as point-of-sale and public

team which won the Women's World Cup as well as Bayern Munich,  Real Madrid,  AC MilanAjax Amsterdam,  or players such as David Beckham and Zinedine Zidane,  shows our skill
in selecting key partners.  In 2004,  we will be celebrating 10 years of the Predator® technology with the launch of the PredatorPulse™.  In addition,  the new F-Line will supply cuttingedge players such as Cissé and Trézéguet with a new generation of football boots led by the

adidas SPORT HERITAGE /// The adidas Sport Heritage division targets sports lifestyle
consumers who seek trend-setting streetwear with authentic origins.  The goal is to be the
brand of choice in the global sports lifestyle market.  This division,  started in 2000,  has been
growing ever since its creation and is now one of the key trend-setting brands in the market for the sports lifestyle consumer.  Limited distribution to prevent dilution of the brand
plays a major role in the success story of this division.  Sport Heritage will broaden its
attack on the whole lifestyle market with fresh new products inspired by our brand's unique
heritage in football,  Olympic sports,  tennis and basketball.  Additionally,  we will expand our
fashion distribution in 2004 as well as increase our focus in the North American market.

'fashion-to-wear" collection in 2004.  Our Y-3 collection,  developed with designer Yohji
Yamamoto,  is helping us extend our product appeal to the cosmopolitan consumers who

presence in this area allows us to expand the power of the adidas brand.  The collection is
limited to fashion-oriented accounts in Europe,  North America and Asia.  Influential design

ECONOMIC AND SECTOR DEVELOPMENT
GLOBAL ECONOMY STARTS TO RECOVER IN SECOND HALF
OF 2003 /// While the global macroeconomic environment
remained disappointing throughout the first six months of
2003,  prospects for an upturn improved during the latter half
of the year.  After some positive signals early in the yeargrowth slowed significantly in February and March mainly as a
result of the geo-political situation in Iraq and the outbreak of
the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).  However,  the
sooner-than-expected end of the war in Iraq and changes in
fiscal policy in a number of countries spurred hopes for an
economic turnaround during the second quarter.  As a resultbusiness and consumer sentiment started to improve in many
regions at the beginning of the second half.  This led to modest
increases in domestic demand,  with more evidence of a
potential recovery coming from all regions as the year progressed.  While development of gross domestic product (GDP)
is the main indicator for our business environment,  consumer
spending,  consumer confidence and exchange rates are also
important,  because they have proven in the past to reliably
project future developments in our industry.

RECOVERY IN US ECONOMY IN THE SECOND HALF OF
2003 /// After a decline in US consumer confidence in each
of the first three months,  the indicator stabilized at the end
of April.  Sentiment then began to improve as interest rate
reductions and the tax relief took effect,  supporting a strong
increase in private consumption.  However,  while economic
activity continued to improve throughout the second half of
the year,  some concerns remained regarding the weak labor
market situation until the unemployment rate started to
decline towards the end of the year.  As a result,  consumer
confidence stood at its highest level in 14 months at the end
of November.  The region's GDP increased 3% compared to the
prior year,  driven by strong increases in the second half.

EUROPEAN ECONOMIES GROW GRADUALLY IN 2003 /// In
the Euro Zone,  economic activity weakened further in the first
half of the year as several large countries such as GermanyItaly and France registered a decline in each of their GDPs
during this period.  However,  the region's consumer confidence gradually improved during the course of the second
half of the year as positive momentum in the global economy
became more evident.  In Germany,  our largest market in
Europe,  the overall business climate improved in December
for the eighth consecutive month and ended the year at its
highest level in three years.  Despite these improvements later
in the year,  economic activity recovered only slowly,  resulting
in flat GDP development for the year.  The region as a whole
posted GDP growth of less than 1%,  reflecting the strong
appreciation of the euro against most major currencies which
hindered increased export activities as an important growth
motor for the European economy. 
ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IMPROVES IN ASIA AND LATIN
AMERICA /// In Japan,  GDP growth was 2% in 2003.  Strong
increases in exports and business investment were the
drivers of this development.  While low private consumption
acted as a brake especially in the third quarter,  consumer
confidence recovered at the end of the year to reach its
highest level in more than two years.  In most other countries
in the region,  such as China,  Thailand and Indonesia,  an
increase in private demand led to solid economic growth for
the full year,  despite the outbreak of SARS,  which had slowed
down economic activity during the first half of the year.  In
Latin America,  macroeconomic signals were largely positive
during 2003.  Argentina's economic upturn,  which started at
the end of 2002 and was driven by strong growth in exports as
well as the strengthening of private consumption,  continued
throughout 2003.  In Chile,  economic growth slowed somewhat
in the middle of the year,  due mainly to weak foreign demand. 
However,  this trend reversed towards the end of the year as
exports picked up and offset weak private demand.  In Brazilhowever,  high real interest rates and declining real wages
reduced the country's private consumption and investment
activity.

AFTER TOUGH START US SPORTING GOODS INDUSTRY
SHOWS SIGNS OF RECOVERY IN SECOND HALF OF THE
YEAR /// The sporting goods industry was under significant
pressure in the first six months of 2003,  but showed some
improvement towards the end of the year.  In the USA,  high
inventory levels at retail further exacerbated an already weak
and strongly promotional environment in the first six months
of the year leading to an industry-wide sales decline of 8%. 
However,  the situation clearly improved during the latter half
of the year driven by increased consumer confidence.  As a
consequence,  reported results from many retailers and
suppliers for the back-to-school season were better than
anticipated and small but visible improvements were recorded
during the holiday season.  During the same period,  lower
inventory levels helped to improve product sell-through at
retail. 
STATE OF THE SPORTING GOODS INDUSTRY IN EUROPE
IMPROVES /// In Europe,  the general retail environment
remained tough throughout the 12-month period and was
characterized by a high number of bankruptcies.  The state of
the sporting goods industry,  however,  improved during the
year.  This is reflected in 2% market growth,  which was a
result of price increases.  Nevertheless,  competition became
more intense in 2003,  as fashion boutiques and trend shops
increasingly targeted the same consumers. 
RETAIL CONSOLIDATION CHARACTERIZES SPORTING GOODS
INDUSTRY IN ASIA /// Retail activity in Asia decelerated
significantly during the first half of the year due to the SARS
outbreak.  However,  the retail consolidation within the sporting
goods sector and higher consumer spending led to improving
conditions in many countries in the second half of 2003.  In
Japan,  for example,  all major domestic sporting goods suppliers began to comment on a stabilization in their businesses
at the end of 2003,  after several years of decline.

GROUP BUSINESS PERFORMANCE
adidas-Salomon CURRENCY-NEUTRAL SALES GROW 5% ///
Currency-neutral sales for the Group grew by 5% with
increased sales at all brands and in all regions except North
America.  In euro terms,  however,  Group sales declined by
4% to € 6267 billion in 2003 from € 6523 billion in 2002,  due
to the strong appreciation of the euro against most major
currencies.

BRAND adidas LEADS SEGMENT GROWTH WITH A 5%
CURRENCY-NEUTRAL SALES IMPROVEMENT /// From a brand
perspective,  adidas sales grew 5% on a currency-neutral
basis.  In euro terms,  sales declined by 3% to € 4950 billion
from € 5105 billion in 2002.  Drivers of the currency-neutral
growth were the Sport Performance running and training
categories helped by evolutions of our successful technologies ClimaCool® and a3®.  Currency-neutral sales in the Sport
Heritage division decreased by 4% (–11% in euros),  reflecting
 decline in footwear products which could only be partly
offset by strong increases in apparel sales,  albeit from a
small base.  Salomon sales increased 2% currency-neutralmainly as a result of increased sales of Mavic cycling components,  outdoor footwear and Salomon apparel.  This increase
was partly offset by lower winter product and inline skate
revenues.  Sales in euro terms were down by 4% to € 658 million in 2003 from € 684 million in 2002.  TaylorMade-adidas
Golf sales grew by 4% on a currency-neutral basis with strong
increases in the iron and putter categories as well as at
adidas Golf more than offsetting lower metalwood and golf
ball sales.  In euro terms,  TaylorMade-adidas Golf sales
declined by 10% to € 637 million from € 707 million in 2002.

CURRENCY-NEUTRAL SALES IN EUROPE UP 8% /// Sales for
adidas-Salomon in Europe grew 8% on a currency-neutral
basis.  In euro terms,  sales were up 5% to € 3365 billion in
2003 from € 3200 billion in 2002.  This growth was driven by
adidas and Salomon.  Sales at brand adidas grew 9% on a
currency-neutral basis and 6% in euro terms to € 2851 billion
in 2003 from € 2694 billion in 2002,  primarily as a result of
strong growth in Italy and the UK as well as the continued
solid performance in France and the emerging markets. 
Salomon also grew,  with European sales up 7% in 2003 on a
currency-neutral basis and sales in euros up 6% to € 418 million in 2003 (2002: € 395 million).  This increase was driven by
sales improvements in all major countries such as FranceItaly,  Switzerland,  Sweden and Germany.  Currency-neutral
sales for TaylorMade-adidas Golf were down 5% mainly due
to a decline in the UK.  This represents a decrease of 14% in
euro terms to € 96 million in 2003 from € 111 million in 2002. 

NORTH AMERICAN CURRENCY-NEUTRAL SALES DECLINE
6% /// In North America,  sales for the Group were down 6%
on a currency-neutral basis.  In euro terms,  this represents a
20% decline to € 1562 billion in 2003 versus € 1960 billion in
the prior year.  Lower footwear revenues at brand adidas were
the main driver of this development and led to an 8% decline
in adidas sales on a currency-neutral basis.  In euro termsbrand adidas revenues were down 23% to € 1067 billion in
2003 from € 1378 billion in 2002.  Salomon sales declined 5%
currency-neutral or by 18% in euro terms to € 164 million in
2003 from € 199 million in 2002.  This was mainly due to the
difficult market environment for alpine products.  Sales at
TaylorMade-adidas Golf developed positively with a currencyneutral increase of 3% despite the non-renewal of the
Slazenger Golf distribution and licensing arrangement,  which
had positively impacted 2002 sales in the region by approximately € 25 million.  In euro terms,  TaylorMade-adidas Golf
sales were down by 13% to € 331 million from € 382 million
in 2002.  Excluding the Slazenger Golf sales that were included
in the prior year's revenues,  sales on a currency-neutral basis
would have increased by 9% (–8% in euros),  reflecting solid
organic sales growth within this segment.

LATIN AMERICA SALES GROW 35% ON A CURRENCYNEUTRAL BASIS /// In Latin America,  where revenues are
generated predominately by brand adidas,  currency-neutral
sales were up 35% in 2003.  In euro terms,  sales grew 10% to
reach € 179 million in 2003 versus € 163 million in 2002.  This
strong development was led by brand adidas,  where sales
grew 34% on a currency-neutral basis and 10% in euro terms
to € 173 million in 2003 from € 158 million in 2002.  The main
driver of this growth was strong performance in Brazil and
Argentina.  Salomon and TaylorMade-adidas Golf,  while only
minor components in overall sales with revenues of € 4 million and € 2 million respectively in 2003,  continued to grow
rapidly at double-digit rates both on a currency-neutral basis
and in euro terms.

CURRENCY-NEUTRAL SALES IN ASIA INCREASE 7% /// In
Asia,  sales increased 7% on a currency-neutral basis.  In euro
terms,  sales in Region Asia were down 4% to € 1116 billion
from € 1166 billion in 2002.  The currency-neutral gains were
driven by brand adidas,  where revenues were up 9%.  The
main contributors to growth at brand adidas were increased
sales in Japan,  China and India.  In euro terms,  adidas sales in
Asia declined 3% to € 839 million in 2003 from € 867 million
in 2002.  At Salomon,  currency-neutral sales were down 9%. 
This development is mainly related to continued poor winter
business in Japan,  with alpine product sales showing a significant decline.  In most other Asian markets,  Salomon grew at
double-digit rates,  albeit from a small base.  In eurosSalomon sales declined 18% to € 69 million in 2003 from
€ 84 million in 2002.  Currency-neutral sales of TaylorMadeadidas Golf increased 9% due to positive development in
South Korea and in nearly all smaller markets but were partly
offset by a decline in the Japanese market.  In euro termssales declined 3% to € 207 million in 2003 from € 214 million
in 2002.

sales primarily come from the TaylorMade and Salomon
brands.  In 2003,  hardware sales increased 1% on a currencyneutral basis.  In euros,  hardware sales were down 8% to
€ 1278 billion from € 1385 billion in 2002.  The primary
drivers of currency-neutral growth were higher TaylorMade
iron and Mavic wheel sales,  which more than offset lower golf
ball revenues,  that were impacted by the non-renewal of a
licensing and distribution agreement with Slazenger Golf.

€ 2288 billion in 2002.  This represents 35% of total Group
sales.  Drivers of the positive currency-neutral development
were Sport Performance apparel,  especially the training
category,  as well as Sport Heritage apparel.  This was partly
offset by lower revenues of the adidas Sport Performance
basketball and football categories.

CURRENCY-NEUTRAL FOOTWEAR SALES UP 6% /// Currencyneutral sales of footwear within the adidas-Salomon Group

mainly driven by the adidas Sport Performance runningtraining and football categories.  Strong growth,  howeveralso came from Salomon outdoor footwear and adidas Golf
footwear.  Declines in footwear sales were recorded in the
basketball and tennis categories as well as in the adidas
Sport Heritage division.  Footwear comprised 44% of total
Group net sales,  reaffirming its position as adidas-Salomon's
most important product category.

70 REPORTING GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT /// GROUP BUSINESS PERFORMANCE

LICENSEE REVENUES DECREASE /// For some product
segments or markets,  adidas-Salomon has licensing agreements with independent companies,  which manage the
design,  development,  manufacture and distribution of specific
product lines.  Currently,  adidas has 18 licensees that source
products from 154 suppliers in 24 different countries.  In 2003net licensee sales decreased by 6% to € 542 million from
€ 577 million in 2002.  This decline was mainly a result of
currency fluctuations.  The expiration of adidas licensee
agreements in North America,  Latin America and Africa also
contributed to this development.  On a like-for-like basislicensee sales would have increased by 7% in 2003 due to
continued solid performance of our licensee for toiletries and
perfume. 
LOWER COST OF SALES IN 2003 /// As the vast majority of
our products are manufactured by independent contractors
and our own production activity is very limited,  our Group
defines cost of sales as the amount we pay to third parties for
expenses associated with producing and delivering our products.  Similar own-production expenses,  although only a small
proportion of the Group's cost of sales,  are also recorded at
Salomon and TaylorMade.  In 2003,  cost of sales was
€ 3453 billion,  representing a decrease of 7% from the
€ 3704 billion level of 2002.  This decrease was stronger than
the decline of the Group's sales in euros and reflects favorable currency effects on purchase prices.  This is a result of
the fact that 70 to 80% of the sourcing volume was incurred
in US dollars,  while the percentage of sales revenues in
US dollars and other non-euro currencies was significantly
lower,  with about half of the Group's sales denominated in
European currencies.  Changes in exchange rates,  especially
the relation between the US dollar and the euro,  therefore
have the potential to markedly affect cost of sales.  Production
and material efficiencies also contributed to this reduction. 

GROSS MARGIN AT RECORD LEVEL DRIVEN BY BRAND
adidas /// The adidas-Salomon gross margin grew 17 percentage points to 449% in 2003 from 432% in 2002.  This is
the Group's highest gross margin on record and clearly above
the 42 to 43% target range communicated by Management in
early 2003.  Brand adidas gross margin improved by 13 percentage points to 406% of sales in 2003 (2002: 392%)reflecting favorable currency fluctuations,  the increased
proportion of own-retail activities and an improving product
mix.  This improvement was reduced by lower gross margins
at brand adidas in North America because of higher clearance
sales.  At Salomon,  gross margin declined 07 percentage
points to 401% (2002: 408%).  This decrease was mainly
attributable to negative currency effects,  arising from the fact
that nearly all Salomon hardware sourcing takes place in
Europe,  while nearly 50% of sales are denominated in noneuro currencies,  which for the most part depreciated significantly versus the euro in 2003.  TaylorMade-adidas Golf gross
margin declined 33 percentage points to 445% in 2003 from
488% in 2002.  The major factor contributing to this decline
were lower metalwood and golf ball gross margins.  Currency
effects on purchase prices,  which are also captured in the
headquarter function as a result of the Group's centralized
hedging strategy,  positively impacted the Group's gross margin
by more than 10 percentage points.  As a result of these
developments and the decrease in sales in euro terms,  Group
gross profit was nearly stable with the prior year's level at
€ 2814 billion (2002: € 2819 billion). 

EUROPE LEADS GROUP GROSS MARGIN EXPANSION /// On
 regional basis,  gross margin improvement was driven by
Europe,  reflecting strong gains within brand adidas as
described above.  In Europe,  the gross margin grew 13 percentage points to 408% in 2003 from 395% in 2002 as a
result of increased own-retail activities as well as an improving product mix and purchase prices.  The gross margin in
North America declined 24 percentage points to 343% in
2003 from 368% in 2002.  This decline was mainly due to
lower demand for many adidas product lines throughout the
year as a result of difficult market conditions.  This led to a
significantly higher portion of clearance sales than in the prior
year.  In Asia,  gross margin decreased 11 percentage points to
468% from 480% in 2002 due to higher clearance sales at
lower margins.  In Latin America,  the gross margin declined
09 percentage points to 389% in 2003 from 399% in the prior
year,  impacted by negative currency effects.

were continued own-retail expansion and higher bad debt
expenses.  Further,  one-time operating income of € 23 million

of land was not repeated in 2003.

this increase was contract prolongations with renegotiated
conditions.

December 31,  2003,  adidas-Salomon employed 15686
people.  This represents an increase of 7% since the end of
2002 when the Group employed 14716 people.  New employees were primarily added in own-retail activities at brand
adidas.  The majority of our employees now work in own-retail
and sales functions.  Personnel expenses (including production) decreased 7% to € 709 million in 2003 from € 758
million in 2002 as a result of currency effects.  Costs which are
directly attributable to production are included within the cost
of sales.  Detailed information regarding adidas-Salomon

OPERATING PROFIT UP 3% /// Operating profit for the Group
increased 3% to € 490 million in 2003 from € 477 million in
2002.  As a result,  the operating margin increased 05 percentage points to 78% in 2003 from 73% in 2002.  This improvement was in line with Management guidance and a result of
the Group's record-level gross margin.  From a brand perspective,  adidas operating profit grew 6% to € 365 million in 2003
from € 343 million in 2002 as currency-neutral sales growth
and gross margin expansion more than offset negative
currency translation effects.  The Salomon operating profit
declined by 10% to € 35 million in 2003 from € 39 million in
2002.  A significant reduction of operating expenses could not
compensate for negative currency effects on sales and gross
margin.  At TaylorMade-adidas Golf,  operating profit declined
9% to € 67 million in 2003 from € 74 million in 2002,  with
strict cost control unable to fully offset lower gross margin. 
In addition to the performance of each segment,  the Group's
operating profit comparison was positively impacted by the
results of our central hedging activities. 

NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES 1)

EUROPE MAIN CONTRIBUTOR TO GROUP OPERATING PROFIT
GROWTH /// In 2003,  the Group's positive operating profit
development was underpinned by improvement in all regions
except North America.  In Europe,  operating profit grew 13%
to € 534 million in 2003 from € 471 million in 2002.  This was
mainly generated by operating profit improvements at adidas. 
In North America,  the significant gross margin decline at
adidas could not be offset by lower operating expenses.  This
led to a reduction of the operating profit by 43% to € 92 million in 2003 from € 162 million in 2002.  In Asia,  operating
profit grew 1% to € 191 million in 2003 from € 189 million
in 2002.  The lower gross margin in 2003 was more than
compensated by an operating expense reduction.  In Latin
America,  operating profit grew 6% to € 25 million in 2003
from € 24 million in 2002.

ROYALTY AND COMMISSION INCOME DOWN 8% /// Royalty
and commission income decreased by 8% to € 42 million in
2003 from € 46 million in 2002.  Higher sales for products
such as toiletries and perfume due to both increased number
of units and higher royalty rates were more than offset by
declines as a result of currency fluctuations.  On a currencyneutral basis,  royalty and commission income would have
increased by 2%. 
GOODWILL AMORTIZATION STABLE /// Goodwill amortization
was stable at € 45 million.  The largest component of the
Group's annual goodwill amortization continues to be the
approximately € 30 million related to the acquisition of the
Salomon group,  which is being amortized over 20 years. 
FINANCIAL EXPENSES REDUCED STRONGLY /// Financial
expenses were reduced by 44% to € 49 million in 2003 from
€ 87 million in 2002.  This decline was supported by lower
interest expenses due to both a lower average level of debt
and lower interest rates in comparison to the prior year
(see Group Management Report / Finance and Investment). 
In addition,  financial expenses in 2002 included negative
currency effects resulting from devaluation in emerging
markets such as Argentina,  Turkey and Brazil. 
INCOME BEFORE TAXES GROWS 12% /// Supported by the
improvement in operating profit combined with the favorable
movement in the financial expenses,  income before taxes
(IBT) was up 12% to € 438 million in 2003 from € 390 million
in 2002.  As a percentage of sales,  income before taxes
increased by 10 percentage points to 70% in 2003 from 60%
in 2002,  reflecting a further improvement of the Group's
healthy profitability level. 

74 REPORTING GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT /// GROUP BUSINESS PERFORMANCE

NET INCOME UP 14% TO RECORD LEVEL /// Net income for
the Group reached a record level of € 260 million in 2003,  up
14% compared to the prior year's level of € 229 million.  This
increase is at the top end of the targeted 10 to 15% stated by
Management since the beginning of 2003.  The main drivers of
this development were a strong IBT performance and also
lower minority interests,  which declined 17% to € 11 million
in 2003 from € 14 million in 2002 mainly due to lower minority
interests at our Salomon TaylorMade-adidas Golf subsidiary in
Japan.  In 2003,  the tax rate increased slightly to 380% of

EARNINGS PER SHARE INCREASE TO € 572 /// In 2003basic earnings per share were € 572 versus € 504 in 2002. 
This is a 14% year-over-year increase in line with the development of the Group's net income.  The total number of shares
outstanding increased by 31250 shares in 2003 to 45453750

end of 2003 to the time at which the audit of the Group's
results was completed,  no material transactions at the Group
or brand level had occurred.  In addition,  there were no major
macroeconomic or sociopolitical changes which we expect to
influence our business materially.  However,  in North Americarecent data flow has provided further evidence of an improving retail environment.  Especially sporting goods retailers
have stated their intention to expand square footage.

MULTI-NATIONAL R&D ACTIVITIES AT adidas-Salomon ///
For brand adidas,  the majority of our research and development activities are located in Herzogenaurach,  Germany,  and
Portland / Oregon,  USA.  For Salomon and TaylorMade-adidas
Golf,  the research and development of products is located at
each segment's respective headquarters in Annecy,  France
and Carlsbad / California,  USA. 
R&D EXPENDITURE INCREASES SLIGHTLY IN 2003 /// In
2003,  expenditures for research and development increased
by 1% to € 86 million,  compared to € 85 million in 2002 due
to higher personnel expenses associated with additional
employees in 2003.  In addition,  market research and analysis
was incurred as part of the Group's operating expenses. 

REVOLUTIONARY TECHNOLOGIES DRIVE 2003 /// In 2003adidas-Salomon brought several new technologies as well as
major enhancements of existing technologies to the market. 
In the football category,  for example,  adidas introduced the
Roteiro™ match ball with an innovative thermal-bonding
production technique and a new Power Balance Technology. 
Major evolutions of existing technologies include ClimaCool® 2
footwear and apparel and a3® Twin Strike footwear as well as
PowerPulse™ technology for the seventh Predator® generation.  With the new PowerPulse™ technology,  an increased
power transfer of 3% is achieved in every kick.  At
TaylorMade-adidas Golf,  examples of the new technologies
include the Miscela golf club set and HT irons.  Miscela is a
new set of golf clubs created to meet the specific needs of
female golfers.  The HT irons are a new addition to the
RAC family of irons,  the RAC HT,  which deliver a higher level
of performance at average clubhead speeds.  At Salomonnew technologies were the ERA® snowboard technology,  a
construction which adjusts automatically to the specific
needs of the individual snowboarder,  as well as the hollow
carbon-reinforced S Core construction for surfboards.  Each of
these technologies is patented and trademark-protected. 

FINANCE AND INVESTMENT
TOTAL ASSETS DECLINE /// In 2003,  total assets decreased
by 2% to € 4188 billion versus € 4261 billion in the prior year
mainly as a result of a reduction in working capital and fixed
assets.

INVENTORIES REDUCED BY 2% /// Working capital management continues to be a high priority at adidas-Salomon. 
Inventories at adidas-Salomon were reduced by 2% to
€ 1164 billion in 2003 from € 1190 billion in 2002,  reflecting
 positive development for the third year in a row.  Improvements were recorded at all brands within the Group and were
the result of successful clearance activities,  careful purchasing in line with backlogs development and favorable currency
impacts.  On a currency-neutral basis,  inventories increased
5%.  This development is in line with our sales growth expectations for 2004.

versus € 1293 billion in the prior year.  On a currency-neutral
basis,  this represents a decline of 10% and reflects strict
discipline in the Group's trade terms management and concerted collection efforts at all brands.  Year-end receivables
development was also impacted by lower fourth quarter
revenues in North America compared to the particularly
strong sales in the region during the same period in the
prior year.

FIXED ASSETS DECREASE /// Fixed assets (including financial
assets) decreased by 7% or € 79 million to € 1128 billion
in 2003 from € 1207 billion in 2002,  with approximately
€ 40 million due to currency effects.  Disposals further
reduced fixed assets by € 20 million.  One major transaction
was the sale of an office building at the Group's headquarters
in Herzogenaurach.  The change in fixed assets due to additions of € 134 million was counterbalanced by depreciation
and amortization including goodwill of € 155 million.  Major
additions relate to the expansion of own-retail activities and
IT infrastructure. 

OTHER NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES INCREASE /// Other noncurrent liabilities nearly doubled to € 35 million in 2003 from
€ 19 million in 2002,  primarily due to an increase in the
negative fair value of financial instruments used for hedging
activities within the Group and an obligation under a capital
lease contract. 

OTHER NON-CURRENT ASSETS INFLUENCED BY PROMOTION CONTRACT EXTENSIONS /// Other non-current assets
increased by 81% to € 105 million in 2003 from € 58 million in
2002.  The increase is mainly due to higher prepayments for
new or extended long-term promotion contracts in football.

EQUITY RATIO IMPROVES FURTHER,  FINANCIAL LEVERAGE
AT LOWEST LEVEL SINCE SALOMON ACQUISITION /// The
Group's equity base was further strengthened in 2003 despite
negative currency effects.  Shareholders' equity rose 25% to
€ 1356 billion in 2003 from € 1081 billion in 2002.  The
majority of the net income was retained within the Group and
used to strengthen the equity base.  In addition,  the equity
component of the convertible bond strongly influenced the
rise in shareholders' equity (see note 15).  Negative effectshowever,  came from the translation of foreign subsidiaries'
equity into euro at year-end due to the decline in the US
dollar and other foreign currencies versus the euro.  As a
matter of corporate policy,  adidas-Salomon hedges for the
translation of the local balance sheets only under certain
circumstances.  In such cases,  if certain criteria are met,  we
may use changes in functional currencies of foreign subsidiaries,  changes in the currency denomination of their
monetary assets,  or hedging with forward contracts or options
for this purpose.  In addition,  the hedging reserve resulting
from the fair valuation of financial instruments used for
product sourcing negatively impacted the year-end equity
balance (see note 23).  The equity ratio rose by 70 percentage
points to 324% in 2003 from 254% in 2002.  Financial leverage
improved 69 percentage points to 70% versus 139% in the
prior year.  This marks the first time since the acquisition of
the Salomon group in 1997/98 that our equity exceeds borrowings and reflects the healthy financial condition of adidasSalomon.

SUCCESSFUL CASH FLOW DEVELOPMENT /// The Group's
cash provided by operating activities is used for investing
activities,  for the reduction of debt and for the payment of
dividends.  Cash outflows for investing activities were
€ 238 million in 2003,  a decrease of 25% versus the 2002 level
of € 315 million,  and included the purchase of tangible,  intangible and financial assets.  Spending for property,  plant and
equipment such as investments in adidas own-retail activitiesincluding major spending for the opening of our new factory
outlet in Herzogenaurach,  and IT projects decreased by
€ 4 million to € 110 million in 2003 from € 114 million in
2002.  Cash outflows for intangible assets were € 35 million
versus € 151 million in 2002.  The prior year includes the
acquisition of the remaining shares of adidas Italy and the
purchase of the Maxfli golf brand in December 2002.  The
net cash used for acquiring subsidiaries in an amount of
€ 20 million in 2002 is related to the acquisition of the
Canadian outdoor specialist Arc'Teryx and the purchase of
Salomon Danmark ApS,  a former distribution partner for
Salomon products in Denmark.  In 2003,  the Group acquired
no subsidiaries.  The Group used excess cash in 2003 to
purchase highly liquid investment funds for an amount of
around € 80 million.

The weighted average interest rate on the Group's gross
borrowings fell to 27% in 2003 from 32% in 2002.  The Group
continued the existing interest rate options as protection
against rising interest rates.  Within this shelter,  we were able
to participate in the interest rate reductions throughout the
year.  As a result of the issuance of the € 400 million 25%
convertible bond and the issuance of fixed-rate private placements,  the share of fixed-rate financing rose sharply.

NET BORROWINGS REDUCED BY € 552 MILLION /// Net
borrowings at December 31,  2003 were € 946 million,  down
37% or € 552 million versus € 1498 billion at the end of the
prior year.  This is the largest reduction in the Group's history. 
As a consequence,  the interest result improved 19% to negative € 59 million in 2003 from negative € 73 million in 2002. 
Continued tight working capital management had a significant
positive impact on this decline.  In addition,  positive currency
effects contributed approximately 15% or € 75 million of the
net borrowings improvement.  Another 21% or € 114 million
of the decrease in the total net borrowings was due to
accounting effects related to the convertible bond issue as
this amount was reported as equity (see note 15).  Howevereven excluding these positive effects,  the Group's net borrowings reduction continued successfully with a decrease for the
third year in a row and significantly exceeded Management's
targets that were announced at the beginning of 2003.

FINANCING STRUCTURE CONTINUES TO IMPROVE ///
Throughout 2003,  adidas-Salomon continued its diversification
into different sources of financing to reduce the dependence
on traditional bank financing.  In addition to existing assetbacked securities (ABS) and commercial paper programs,  the
Group issued new long-term private placements of $ 175 million and 3 billion (in total € 162 million as at December 31Y
2003) to US and Far East investors with maturities up to 2015
and a € 400 million convertible bond maturing in 2018 with an
interest rate of 25% (see note 15).  As a result of the sharp
decline in net borrowings during 2003,  the Group temporarily
suspended its commercial paper programs and repaid private
placements with remaining short maturities in a total amount
of € 31 million.  Utilization of available credit facilities for the
Group was 36% at the end of 2003 versus 45% at the end of
2002.  The Group reduced or cancelled credit lines in limited
amounts,  to bring the financing facilities more in line with
anticipated future needs.  Most of adidas-Salomon's remaining
medium-term credit lines were extended from 2006 to 2007.

adidas SALES UP 5% ON A CURRENCY-NEUTRAL BASIS IN

In euro terms,  however,  at € 4950 billion,  sales were 3%
lower than in 2002,  when sales reached € 5105 billion. 
Currency-neutral sales increased in all regions except North
America. 
CURRENCY-NEUTRAL SPORT PERFORMANCE GAINS DRIVEN
BY RUNNING AND TRAINING CATEGORIES /// adidas Sport
Performance is the largest division within the Group and
comprises 83% of brand adidas revenues.  Currency-neutral
sales grew 7% in 2003.  This represents a decline of 1% in
euro terms to € 4102 billion in 2003 from € 4154 billion
in 2002.  The product categories with the highest growth in
the division were running and training,  where currencyneutral sales grew at double-digit rates.  The strongest performing product initiatives in these two categories were the
ClimaCool® 2,  the Barracks as well as the B and C series on
the footwear side and adidas Colours in apparel. 
STRONG INCREASES IN APPAREL DESPITE OVERALL CONSOLIDATION AT SPORT HERITAGE /// The Sport Heritage
division contributes 17% to brand adidas sales.  In 2003,  sales
in this division declined 4% on a currency-neutral basis or
11% in euro terms to € 817 million versus € 922 million in
2002.  This reduction reflects our efforts to optimize distribution of Sport Heritage products.  In footwear,  we limited distribution in certain European markets and Japan to prevent a
potential oversupply of these products.  And in North Americathe lack of Sport Heritage footwear in lifestyle and fashion
channels had a negative impact on sales.  As a result,  footwear revenues decreased 7% on a currency-neutral basis
or 14% in euro terms to € 732 million in 2003 versus
€ 854 million in 2002.  In apparel,  however,  just the opposite
occurred.  This small but fast growing category delivered
currency-neutral revenue growth of 54% or 42% in euros to
€ 69 million in 2003 from € 49 million in 2002.  The main
driver of this improvement was increased expansion of distribution as part of our efforts to better balance the proportion
of apparel sales in our Sport Heritage business.

adidas OWN RETAIL AS IMPORTANT TOP-LINE GROWTH
DRIVER /// An increasingly important part of brand adidas
revenues are own-retail activities.  Own retail within adidas
consists of four components: concept stores,  concession
corners in emerging markets,  factory outlets and Internet
sales.  At the end of 2003,  adidas operated 173 concept stores
(2002: 161).  These stores market Sport Performance and / or
Sport Heritage products directly to the consumer.  Major
openings included Sport Performance stores in MarseilleLyon and Fukuoka as well as adidas Originals stores in MilanMiami and Munich.  adidas concession corners,  which provide
sales infrastructure in emerging markets,  in particular
in Asia,  number 178 (2002: 269) and declined as a result of
closures mainly in non-urban locations,  particularly in the
Philippines.  Factory outlets,  which are utilized to optimize
clearance activities for brand adidas,  currently number 174
(2002: 173).  Internet sales for North America are available at
www, adidas, com.  adidas own-retail activities made up 9%
of brand sales in 2003,  up from 8% in the prior year.  This
represents an increase of 21% in currency-neutral terms and
9% in euros to € 447 million in 2003 from € 410 million in
2002.  This was driven both by comparable sales growth and
new store openings.

GROSS MARGIN EXPANSION CONTINUES /// The adidas gross
margin improved 13 percentage points to 406% in 2003 from
392% in 2002.  Drivers of this improvement were increased
own-retail activities as described above and our improving
product mix.  Favorable development of purchase prices in
euros also positively impacted the adidas gross margin.  Taken
together,  these effects more than offset a significantly lower
gross margin in North America,  which resulted from increased
clearance sales at lower margins due to weakness in demand
for many adidas product lines in the market.  As a result of
the gross margin improvement,  and despite lower revenues
in euro terms,  adidas gross profit increased slightly to
€ 2008 billion in 2003 versus € 2004 billion in 2002. 
OPERATING PROFIT INCREASES 6% /// In 2003,  adidas
operating expenses were reduced by 1% to € 1643 billion
from € 1661 billion in the prior year due to decreases in
North America and Asia,  which were largely a result of currency effects.  As a percentage of sales,  however,  operating
expenses increased 07 percentage points to 332% in 2003
from 325% in 2002.  The main contributors to this rise were
continued own-retail expansion,  increased marketing working
budget and higher bad debt expenses in Europe.  Despite this
development,  gross margin expansion drove adidas operating
profit up 6% to € 365 million in 2003 versus € 343 million in
the prior year.  Similarly,  operating margin increased 06 percentage points to 74% of sales versus 67% in the prior year. 

YEAR-END ORDER BACKLOGS REFLECT MIXED DEVELOPMENTS /// adidas backlogs at the end of 2003 increased 2%
versus the prior year on a currency-neutral basis.  This represents a decrease of 5% in euro terms.  Apparel backlogs grew
13% on a currency-neutral basis (+6% in euros) highlighting
the strength of our 'Apparel Breakthrough" initiative,  while
footwear backlogs declined 7% in currency-neutral terms
(–14% in euros) reflecting weakness in North America. 
CURRENCY-NEUTRAL SALES EXPECTED TO INCREASE AT
MID-SINGLE-DIGIT RATES /// For 2004,  we expect currencyneutral sales to grow at mid-single-digit rates with gains in
all regions except North America.  Sales increases will be
driven by improvements in the running and football categories,  as well as increasing sales from our new and evolving
technologies such as ClimaCool®,  a3® and the T-Mac 4 Laceless Footwear technology,  as well as new products such as
the Roteiro™ match ball,  the PredatorPulse™ and F50 football
boots (see Brand Strategies and Group Management Report /
Outlook).  Gross margin in the segment is expected to improvereflecting increased own-retail sales,  lower clearance sales
and an improving product mix.  Therefore,  operating profit
should increase as a result of underlying sales and gross
margin improvements.

CURRENCY-NEUTRAL SALES GROW 9% IN EUROPE ///
Sales for brand adidas in Europe increased 9% on a
currency-neutral basis.  In euro terms,  revenues grew 6%
to € 2851 billion in 2003 from € 2694 billion in 2002.  The
strongest increases came from Italy,  where sales were up
30%.  Solid gains were also recorded in the UK,  France and
Spain.  In the emerging markets,  which include Eastern
European countries,  the Middle East and Africa,  revenues
continued to grow at double-digit rates,  with particularly
strong gains in Russia.  Increased focus on key accounts and
adidas own-retail activities were the main contributors to
growth in each of these markets. 
POSITIVE ORDER BACKLOG DEVELOPMENT CONTINUES ///
At the end of 2003,  orders in Europe were up 9% on a currencyneutral basis with particularly strong growth rates in FranceSpain and the UK.  In euro terms,  this improvement was 6%. 
Apparel was the main driver of this improvement,  with backlogs up 13% on a currency-neutral basis (+11% in euros) due
to increases in football,  reflecting higher product demand in
advance of the UEFA EURO 2004™ European Football Championships,  and in the training category as a result of our
'Apparel Breakthrough" initiative.  Footwear orders grew 4% in
currency-neutral terms (+1% in euros) as a result of growth in
football and training.  Despite this positive development,  the
challenging competitive environment in Europe leads adidas to
project mid-single-digit sales growth in Europe for 2004.

CURRENCY-NEUTRAL SALES IN NORTH AMERICA DECLINE
8% /// On a currency-neutral basis,  adidas sales in North
America declined 8%.  In euro terms,  revenues decreased 23%
in 2003 to € 1067 billion from € 1378 billion in the prior year. 
Difficult market conditions in the first half of the year,  tough
comparisons with prior year results in the second half of the
year and lower demand for many adidas product lines
throughout the year were the reasons for this weak development.  This led to a significantly higher portion of clearance
sales than in the prior year.

NORTH AMERICAN BUSINESS TO BE STABILIZED IN 2004 ///
Year-end backlogs for North America decreased 18% on a
currency-neutral basis or 31% in euro terms.  From a product
perspective,  footwear orders declined by 26% currencyneutral (–38% in euros) as a result of lower demand in all
major product categories except football.  Apparel backlogs
declined 2% in currency-neutral terms and 17% in euros. 
While this figure is negative,  it shows improvement versus
the prior quarter and reflects solid improvement in the
training category.  The year-end backlog development in
North America continued to reflect lower demand for performance products,  a negative trend that began in 2002. 
However,  in light of recent market trends,  retailer commentary and major sporting events scheduled for 2004,  we are
confident that we will be able to stabilize our adidas business
in North America during the year.

currency-neutral sales growth was achieved despite tough

adidas IN ASIA SET TO DELIVER SOLID CURRENCY-NEUTRAL
GROWTH AGAIN IN 2004 /// The order backlog development
in Asia at the end of 2003 was up 18% on a currency-neutral
basis or 8% in euro terms.  Apparel,  which is expected to be
the main driver of growth in the region,  delivered backlog
growth of 40% on a currency-neutral basis or 28% in eurosdue to increases in nearly all categories as a result of our
'Apparel Breakthrough" initiative.  Footwear backlogs
increased 1% on a currency-neutral basis (–8% in euros). 
This reflects modest gains in the basketball and running
categories.  In light of these developments and the largely
positive macroeconomic indicators in Asia,  we expect doubledigit top-line growth for brand adidas in the region.

CURRENCY-NEUTRAL adidas SALES IN LATIN AMERICA UP
34% /// From a regional perspective in 2003,  the adidas brand
grew most vigorously in Latin America where sales increased
by 34% on a currency-neutral basis.  In euro terms,  sales
improved 10% to € 173 million in 2003 from € 158 million in
2002.  Strong double-digit growth in Argentina,  Brazil and
Chile was the driver of this positive development. 
OUTLOOK FOR adidas IN LATIN AMERICA AGAIN OPTIMISTIC /// Although we do not have formalized backlog figures
for this region,  initial discussions with customers suggest
that currency-neutral sales are expected to again grow at
double-digit rates during 2004.  The primary drivers of adidas
revenue growth in Latin America for 2004 will be improved
brand positioning in major markets as well as increased
adidas own-retail activities.

EUROPE DRIVES CURRENCY-NEUTRAL SALES GROWTH ///
From a regional perspective,  Europe drove currency-neutral
growth for Salomon in 2003.  Currency-neutral sales in the
region grew 7% driven by improvements in all major countries
such as France,  Italy,  Switzerland,  Sweden and Germany.  In
North America and Asia,  currency-neutral sales declined
 and 9% respectively,  mainly as a result of lower sales in the
USA and Japan.  In Latin America,  currency-neutral revenues
of Salomon grew 33%,  albeit from a very small base,  due to
growing market share in Argentina and Brazil.  Currency
effects negatively impacted revenues in all regions.  In euro
terms,  sales grew 6% in Europe to € 418 million in 2003 from
€ 395 million in 2002.  In North America,  revenues declined
18% in euro terms to € 164 million versus € 199 million in
the prior year.  Asian sales also declined 18% in euros to
€ 69 million in 2003 from € 84 million in 2002.  And in Latin
America,  sales increased 12% in euro terms to € 4 million
versus € 3 million in the prior year.

€ 240 million in 2002,  and operating expenses as a percentage of sales declined 04 percentage points to 347% from
351% in the prior year.  These reductions were driven by
continued strict cost control,  which led to lower expenditures
in all operating expense categories.  Despite lower operating
expenses,  Salomon operating profit declined 10% to € 35 million in 2003 from € 39 million in 2002 and operating margin
declined 04 percentage points to 54% of sales in 2003 versus
57% in the prior year.  Both these declines are fully attributable to negative currency effects on sales and gross margin

NEGATIVE CURRENCY EFFECTS DRIVE GROSS MARGIN
DECLINE /// Salomon gross margin declined 07 percentage
points to 401% in 2003 versus 408% in 2002.  This decrease
was mainly attributable to negative currency effects,  arising
from the fact that nearly all Salomon hardware sourcing takes
place in Europe,  while nearly 50% of segment sales are
registered in non-euro currencies.  These currencies for the
most part depreciated significantly versus the euro in 2003. 
As a result of this development and lower revenues in euro
terms,  Salomon gross profit declined 6% to € 264 million in
2003 from € 279 million in 2002. 

CURRENCY-NEUTRAL SALES TO IMPROVE BUT MARGINS TO
REMAIN UNDER PRESSURE DUE TO NEGATIVE CURRENCY
EFFECTS IN 2004 /// At Salomon,  we expect currency-neutral
sales to increase at mid-single-digit rates in 2004.  Summer
sports products are likely to be the primary growth driverhelped by our expanding Salomon apparel line and the innovative Ground Control System™ footwear.  Furthermore,  winter
sports products also look poised to deliver growth with strong
new products in the alpine and nordic categories (see Brand
Strategies and Group Management Report / Outlook).  Gross
margin,  however,  is likely to remain under pressure as a
result of the negative currency effects explained above.  As a
result,  operating profit is unlikely to surpass the 2003 level in
the coming year.

CURRENCY-NEUTRAL TAYLORMADE-adidas GOLF SALES UP
4% /// Currency-neutral sales at TaylorMade-adidas Golf grew
4% during 2003.  In euro terms,  full year revenues declined
10% to € 637 million in 2003 from € 707 million in 2002.  The
currency-neutral sales growth was realized despite the fact
that sales comparisons were negatively impacted by the nonrenewal of a distribution and licensing arrangement with
Slazenger Golf at the end of 2002.  Excluding the approximately € 25 million of Slazenger Golf sales that was included
in last year's revenues,  currency-neutral sales would have
increased by 9%.  Like-for-like revenues in euros were down
8%. 
CURRENCY-NEUTRAL SALES GROWTH DRIVEN BY NEW
PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND EXPANDING PRODUCT
LINES /// The currency-neutral sales improvement at TaylorMade-adidas Golf was a result of solid double-digit increases
in the irons,  putters,  footwear and apparel categories.  This
growth was largely driven by new product introductions in the
hardware categories such as our RAC technology,  a new type
of club head construction that dramatically improves feel at
impact and was employed in all new irons and wedges in
2003,  and expanding product line and market shares of our
soft goods products.  Sales of both metalwoods and golf ballshowever,  declined.  This decrease is mainly a result of higher
clearance sales in advance of new product launches in 2004. 
However,  with strong product introductions during the yearincluding a further evolution of the successful metalwood
R500 Series,  TaylorMade was able to not only remain world
leader in the industry's largest and most important category
but even further strengthened its number one position in
2003.  Golf ball sales declined,  impacted by the non-renewal of
the Slazenger Golf distribution and licensing arrangement at
the end of 2002.

HIGHEST SALES INCREASES IN ASIA /// On a regional basisthe largest currency-neutral revenue growth in 2003 came
from Asia,  where sales increased 9%.  All markets except
Japan contributed to this development.  Currency-neutral
sales also increased in North America,  up 3%,  despite the
non-renewal of a licensing and distribution arrangement
with Slazenger Golf for products which are primarily marketed
in the USA.  Currency-neutral sales in Europe declined 5%
as a result of pricing pressure in the UK.  Negative currency
effects impacted TaylorMade-adidas Golf sales performance
in all regions.  As a result,  Asian revenues in euro terms
declined 3% to € 207 million in 2003 versus € 214 million in
2002.  In North America,  sales in euros declined 13% to
€ 331 million from € 382 million in the prior year.  And in
Europe,  sales were down 14% in euros to € 96 million in
2003 from € 111 million in 2002. 
GROSS MARGIN IMPACTED BY HIGHER CLEARANCE SALES
IN ADVANCE OF PRODUCT LAUNCHES /// In 2003,  TaylorMade-adidas Golf's gross margin declined 33 percentage
points to 455% from 488% in 2002.  This decrease was mainly
 result of lower metalwood margins in Asia as a consequence of higher clearance sales in preparation for new
product launches in 2004.  Lower golf ball margins due to
higher costs associated with increased tour standards also
contributed to the margin decline.  These effects more than
offset increases resulting from strong improvements in the
iron category attributable to a higher proportion of the highmargin RAC products.  As a result of the gross margin decline
and lower revenues in euro terms,  TaylorMade-adidas Golf
gross profit decreased 16% to € 290 million in 2003 from
€ 345 million in 2002. 

STRICT COST CONTROL ONLY PARTIALLY OFFSETS GROSS
MARGIN DECLINE /// Operating expenses at TaylorMadeadidas Golf decreased by 18% to € 222 million in 2003 from
€ 271 million in 2002.  As a percentage of sales,  this represents a reduction of 34 percentage points to 349% in 2003
from 383% in 2002.  This strong reduction was achieved as a
result of continued strict cost control in particular with
respect to administrative overheads.  As a result,  operating
profit for TaylorMade-adidas Golf decreased 9% to € 67 million in 2003 from € 74 million in 2002.  Operating margin
grew 01 percentage points to 106% of sales in 2003 from
105% in 2002. 
PROVISION OF BACKLOG INFORMATION ON TAYLORMADEadidas GOLF NOT MEANINGFUL /// Because backlogs are
measured differently in golf than in other parts of our business,  we do not provide order information for TaylorMadeadidas Golf. 
ALL MAJOR P&L ITEMS TO IMPROVE AT TAYLORMADEadidas GOLF IN 2004 /// For 2004,  we expect currency-neutral
sales at TaylorMade-adidas Golf to grow at mid-single-digit
rates.  This development will be driven primarily by the
strength of our metalwood category,  where the introduction
of a new metalwood is likely to further extend our leading
position in golf's largest category (see Brand Strategies and
Group Management Report / Outlook).  In addition,  we expect
our growing market share in the iron category to continue
and anticipate ongoing above-average growth for adidas Golf
products in 2004.  Gross margin in the segment is also expected to improve,  reflecting continued product mix improvements.  Likewise,  operating profit should increase as a result
of these developments coupled with further operating efficiency gains.

Risk Management /// THE GLOBAL BUSINESS LANDSCAPE OF THE SPORTING GOODS INDUSTRY REMAINED
HIGHLY VOLATILE IN 2003 WITH MACROECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES AND RAPIDLY CHANGING CONSUMER PREFERENCES.  AS A RESULT,  THE adidas-Salomon GROUP IS CONTINUALLY CONFRONTED BY A VARIETY OF RISKS WHILE AT
THE SAME TIME EXPLORING OPPORTUNITIES TO MAXIMIZE
EARNINGS AND INCREASE SHAREHOLDER VALUE.  OUR RISK
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM PROVIDES THE FRAMEWORK FOR
SAFEGUARDING OUR STRONG COMPETITIVE POSITION
GLOBALLY AND FOR SUSTAINING THE SUCCESS OF OUR
GROUP INTO THE FUTURE. 

94 REPORTING GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT /// RISK MANAGEMENT

RISK MANAGEMENT PHILOSOPHY /// Risk management at
adidas-Salomon addresses both short-term operational as
well as long-term strategic risks.  Opportunity-focused,  but
risk-aware decision-making is a central element of the
Group's management practice across all brands,  regions and
functions.  It is not our goal to avoid all potential risks,  but to
maintain an optimal balance between risk avoidance,  risk
reduction,  risk transfer and controlled risk acceptance.  Risk
sensitivity must not compromise our capability to identifycreate and act on opportunities,  and thereby generate
attractive shareholder returns. 
RISK MANAGEMENT VALUES AND PRINCIPLES /// Responsibilities within the risk management system are reflected in
the Group's existing functional and hierarchical organization
structure.  This system is characterized by the following values
and principles:
> Risk management must ensure early identification,  appropriate communication and continuous monitoring of risksin combination with suitable action for risk avoidancereduction,  transfer or acceptance. 
> In cases where risk cannot be avoided or transferred,  it is
the responsibility of functional management on all organizational levels to prepare and implement contingency
plans with the objective to reduce the potential risk impact
to an acceptable level. 
> Risk management is fully integrated into the day-to-day
management practice in all functions and on all
organizational levels.  It is primarily the responsibility of
functional management,  supported by the strategic directions from regional and brand business units and global
headquarters. 
> Further,  it is the responsibility of functional management
on all organizational levels to report risk-relevant information in a timely,  accurate and complete manner to the
appropriate management levels. 
> All employees of the adidas-Salomon Group are encouraged to be active participants of the risk management
system within their area of responsibility; the Executive
Board and senior management are committed to sponsor
the risk management system by building risk management
awareness throughout the organization. 

RISK AREAS /// Risks that may impact the future performance of the adidas-Salomon Group are in the following
areas in particular:
CONSUMER SPENDING /// The sporting goods industry is
sensitive to changes in the global macroeconomic environment.  Recession,  inflation,  political developments and even
weather conditions often result in considerable changes in
consumer sentiment and buying behavior.  As experienced in
2003 with SARS and the war in Iraq,  consumer spending
was temporarily negatively impacted in Asia and the North
American markets respectively.  Such incidents have the
potential to impact the Group's financial performance.  However,  adidas-Salomon enjoys the competitive advantage of a
well-balanced business portfolio across numerous brands
and geographic regions.  Consumer spending related shortfalls in individual markets are therefore unlikely to threaten
the stability of the Group. 

CONSUMER PREFERENCES AND BRAND IMAGE /// The
success of the Group depends to a large extent on the image
of our brands and our capabilities to market products that
meet consumer preferences.  In this context,  we face a strategic risk which,  among others,  is addressed by careful longterm strategic marketing planning including thorough market
research in the areas of design,  quality,  image and pricing. 
adidas-Salomon puts significant efforts into the development
and enhancement of industry-leading performance technologies and trend-setting designs. 
MARKETING INVESTMENTS /// The successful launch of new
products and the continuous strengthening of brand image
require considerable expenditure for marketing and advertising.  The impact of campaigns and sponsorship contracts
depends on a variety of sometimes non-controllable factors
such as the success of individual athletes or clubs.  In order
to address this risk,  adidas-Salomon works with top-tier
marketing and advertising agencies for a thorough cost /
benefit evaluation of major campaigns and sponsorship
agreements. 
PRODUCTION AND SUPPLY /// The vast majority of adidasSalomon products are manufactured by independent factories
in accordance with our technical material and design specifications.  The reliable performance of these suppliers in
terms of timely delivery,  quality and pricing is vital for the
success of the Group.  In order to control this potential riskadidas-Salomon employs more than 100 quality control
officers who monitor supplier standards (see Sustainability). 
Among others,  detailed material cost and manufacturing
process analyses are performed to ensure competitive sourcing costs.  Regular benchmarking reviews address performance variances between factories. 

PRODUCT SOURCING /// Most of the production facilities of
the Group's suppliers are located in the emerging markets of
Asia (see Global Operations).  As a result,  adidas-Salomon is
exposed to risks associated with business activities in these
countries.  Among others,  this includes changes in dutiestariffs or currency exchange rates,  or trade restrictions,  quotas
and political instability.  In order to avoid over-dependency on
individual suppliers or countries adidas-Salomon maintains
relationships with a number of production partners in different
countries.  As a result of this strategy,  adidas-Salomon was
able to successfully manage the 2003 SARS crisis in Asia
without any major negative impact on the Group's financial
results. 
CURRENCY /// Most of the Group's currency risks result from
the fact that approximately 70 to 80% of our sourcing is done
with suppliers that are primarily located in the Far East and
the products are invoiced mainly in US dollars.  However,  since
our sales to customers are denominated primarily in euro
and other currencies (such as the Japanese yen and British
pound),  the Group is exposed to the risk of exchange rate
movements.  Further,  the Group has started to protect future
royalty income in foreign currencies.  Natural hedges are used
in the management of currency risks wherever possible.  In
order to further mitigate this exposure,  the Group hedges
foreign currency risks for typically up to 15 to 18 months in
advance,  including forward contracts,  swaps and currency
options or combinations of currency options.  Treasury management at adidas-Salomon is strongly centralized at the
Group headquarters. 

adidas SPORT HERITAGE ///
ORIGINALS BAGONA BAG

FINANCING NEEDS /// The Group's level of debt has been
considerably reduced in 2003.  However,  we believe it is always
prudent to ensure sufficient refinancing possibilities on an
ongoing basis.  During the past years,  adidas-Salomon has
diversified into different sources of financing to reduce our
dependency on traditional bank financing.  In addition to the
existing ABS,  commercial paper programs and private placements,  the Group launched a € 400 million convertible bond
with a maturity up to 2018 (see note 15).  With respect to credit
line relationships with banks,  adidas-Salomon concentrates
on centrally managed global banking relationships.  Due to the
Group's operations around the globe,  operating cash is also
spread over different locations.  Wherever possible and economically feasible,  cash is concentrated centrally.  The authorization of banking partners is regularly reviewed.  Short- and
longer-term investments of surplus liquidity are arranged at
the headquarter level,  considering counterparty and product
limits.  In order to minimize the risk of a major rise in interest
rates,  the vast majority of the Group's floating rate borrowings
are protected with interest rate caps.  Furthermore,  during
2003 adidas-Salomon has made use of the historically low
longer-term interest rates to shift part of its borrowings from
floating to fixed-rate financing arrangements. 

96 REPORTING GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT /// RISK MANAGEMENT

SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS /// We have continuing responsibilities to our workers and the environment. 
Malpractice in these areas can have a significant impact on
the reputation and operational efficiency of our Group and its
suppliers.  Our Social and Environmental Affairs (SEA) team
monitors the factories of adidas-Salomon suppliers to ensure
compliance with social,  environmental,  health and safety
standards,  creating and implementing action plans to ensure
improvements where necessary.  These internal audits are
verified by the Fair Labor Association (FLA).  At adidasSalomon,  we believe that the most sustainable way to enforce
compliance with our Standards of Engagement is by providing
constant training,  communication and consultation for our
suppliers' management and their workers.  For this reasonthe SEA team has increased its focus on training our business
partners in developing systems for self-governance,  in addition to monitoring them (see Sustainability). 
LEGAL MATTERS /// As a global corporation,  adidas-Salomon
operates under a wide variety of legal and regulatory frameworks.  Finding solutions for various legal matters in numerous countries entails risk for the Group,  especially in the
formulation of contracts,  the resolution of legal issues and
the taking of legal action.  To manage these tasks,  internal and
external specialists are assigned to these matters.  Based on
all outstanding litigation,  we believe that the ultimate liabilities resulting from any claims not already covered by accurals
and provisions will not materially affect the consolidated
financial position of the Group. 

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION AND PIRACY ///
adidas-Salomon is exposed to risk from product counterfeiting and imitation,  which can cause the loss of sales and
damage to our reputation.  The Group is also exposed to the
risk of claims and litigation from third parties for infringement of their rights.  We therefore take a number of measures
to manage these risks,  including legal protection (usually
through registration) for our important trademarks,  designs
and innovations.  We also utilize brand protection programs in
our key markets to detect and take action against product
counterfeiting and imitation and carefully research new
products and product names to identify and avoid potentially
conflicting rights of third parties. 
PRODUCT LIABILITY /// As a supplier of consumer productsadidas-Salomon can face legal action if and when defective
products are sold.  Apart from the financial consequences of
product liability cases,  for which we have adequate insurance
cover,  these cases may damage market perception of our
products,  resulting in image impairment.  Through intensive
quality control we seek to minimize these risks. 

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY /// adidas-Salomon utilizes a
complex network of communications and IT applications in its
business activities.  Therefore natural disaster,  criminal
mischief or IT mismanagement could result in a severe
disruption of our business.  We employ various methods to
mitigate these risks and prevent or minimize such disruptions.  These actions include,  but are not limited to,  the
utilization of hardware and software experts,  firewall and
encryption technologies and business continuity planning. 
Our wide area network (WAN) connections are set up in such
 way as to prevent system-wide failure from a single disturbance and all our dial-up connections to the corporate
Intranet are encrypted. 

SAFEGUARDING THE ONGOING BUSINESS /// Despite obvious business risks,  adidas-Salomon is operationally and
financially strong,  with sizable assets and liquidity.  We are
constantly working to reduce and transfer risk as appropriate. 
Based on the compilation of risks explained within this report
and the current business outlook,  no immediate risks have
been identified which could jeopardize the Group's ongoing
business health and viability.  The Group's equity capitalization
and earning power form a solid basis for our future business
development.  We have taken appropriate precautions against
typical business risks that could negatively affect our financial
standing and profitability situation. 

PROPERTY /// adidas-Salomon products are manufacturedshipped and stored all over the world.  Physical damage to
premises,  production units and warehouses can lead to
business interruption.  These risks are mitigated by a variety
of loss prevention measures,  which include working with
reliable suppliers and logistics providers who guarantee high
safety standards.  adidas-Salomon also maintains sufficient
insurance cover to prevent financial loss in the event of such
damage.

adidas SPORT PERFORMANCE ///
ADISTAR SINGLET SHIRT

98 REPORTING GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT /// OUTLOOK

IMPROVING ECONOMIC OUTLOOK /// At the beginning of
2004,  economic indicators suggest that global markets are on
the upturn and there is potential for continued recovery.  In the
USA,  both consumer confidence and GDP growth expectations
are at 18-month highs and the increased competitiveness of
the US economy resulting from a weaker dollar has increased
the potential for an export-driven upswing.  As a result,  leading economists project GDP growth in the region of between
 and 4% in 2004.  In the Euro Zone,  economic growth is also
expected to accelerate,  however the strong appreciation of the
euro versus other currencies is likely to continue to dampen
economic recovery in the region.  On the other hand,  expected
improvements in the labor market as well as tax cuts scheduled to take effect early in the year have the potential to
stimulate private consumption during the course of 2004.  As
 result of these developments,  GDP growth of around 2% is
projected for the region.  The Japanese economy is expected
to improve further in 2004.  In addition to exports benefiting
from the loosening of China's import restrictions,  private
consumption should also pick up due to less volatile compensation levels.  This is expected to lead to economic growth of
around 2%.  For the rest of Asia,  the growth expectations are
based on an increasing domestic demand in the major markets.  In Latin America,  although GDP growth expectations
vary widely among individual countries,  economic and financial conditions have improved strongly throughout the region
over the last year,  providing optimism for both increased
financial stability and a solid economic recovery. 

POSITIVE SIGNALS IN THE SPORTING GOODS SECTOR /// The
sales outlook for the sporting goods sector is expected to
improve during 2004.  In the USA,  increased consumer spending,  higher retail sales in the second half of 2003 as well as
better-than-expected back-to-school and holiday season
sales in the sector underpin expectations of further improvements.  In Europe,  the consumption of sporting goods products is expected to remain under pressure.  In some European
markets,  especially in the UK,  increased promotional activity
by retailers is likely to lead to more customized product
assortments from suppliers as well as increasing own-retail
activities.  Despite these trends,  a turnaround of the apparel
market is expected and should be supported by the UEFA
EURO 2004™ European Football Championships.  Similarlythe Summer Olympics in Athens should also serve as a
positive impulse for the market.  In Japan,  further retail
consolidation is expected to increase price pressure on major
vendors.  However,  projected increases in private consumption
have led major retailers to announce significant expansion
plans for the first time in five years. 

CURRENCY-NEUTRAL SALES GROWTH OF 3 TO 5%
EXPECTED /// Based on these economic and sector developments as well as the backlog development at brand adidas
(see Group Management Report / adidas) and feedback from
retailers,  we expect to grow Group sales by 3 to 5% on a
currency-neutral basis in 2004.  These gains will be driven by
top-line expansion at adidas,  Salomon and TaylorMade-adidas
Golf.  Improvements are anticipated in all product categorieswith apparel projected to lead the way based on the strength
of our 'Apparel Breakthrough" initiative.  Further,  we expect
this growth to be largely driven by volume increases. 
STABILIZING BUSINESS IN NORTH AMERICA AS TOP PRIORITY /// On a regional level,  our top priority will be to stabilize
our adidas business in North America.  This will be supported
by a new management team,  which was put in place in
January 2004.  The primary focus of our activities will be to
enhance relationships with retail partners by fine-tuning our
distribution strategy,  launching a major brand advertising
campaign,  entitled 'Impossible is Nothing",  and increasing
the own-retail presence of brand adidas.  These activities
coupled with the improving economic and sector outlook in
the USA are expected to drive currency-neutral growth in the
second half of 2004. 

CONTINUED STRENGTH EXPECTED IN EUROPE /// In our
largest and most profitable region,  Europe,  we plan to continue on our solid growth path in 2004.  adidas supplies the
official match ball and is Official Licensee for the UEFA EURO
2004™ European Football Championships in Portugal and
Official Outfitter for the Summer Olympics in Athens.  Both
these events are expected to increase adidas brand exposure
and sales in Europe.  Our successful 'Winning in Europe"
program (see Group Strategy) aims to accelerate top-line
growth in the region with focus on key accounts and own
retail.  In addition,  the 'Winning in Europe" area formation
should generate bottom-line improvements of approximately
€ 50 million between 2003 and 2006.  Our sales growth
projection for the region in 2004,  however,  remains in the
mid-single-digit range,  reflecting the overall difficult retail
environment in most markets.

OWN-RETAIL EXPANSION TO DRIVE GROWTH IN ASIA AND
LATIN AMERICA /// In Asia and Latin America,  expansion of
own-retail activities will be the key drivers of growth,  as retail
infrastructure is less developed in these regions than in other
parts of the world.  Major gains will come from Japan,  KoreaChina,  Australia,  Brazil,  Mexico and Argentina,  where growth
will be spurred by new product and marketing initiatives as
well as sourcing and distribution optimization.  Varied but
largely positive macroeconomic development in these regions
will also support growth in 2004.  As a result,  double-digit
currency-neutral sales increases are expected in both Asia
and Latin America. 
NEW PRODUCTS AS IMPORTANT DRIVER OF GROWTH IN
2004 /// At adidas-Salomon,  one of our key competitive
advantages is our technological leadership in the sporting
goods industry.  Since 2001,  we have successfully brought at
least one major product revolution or significant evolution per
year to the market.  In 2004,  we will continue to leverage this
strength by further commercializing evolutions of our wellestablished technologies and introducing several completely
new product technologies to the market.  In addition to these
new technologies,  the continued strength of our largest
sports categories within each of the brands will be critical to
meeting our growth expectations in 2004. 

99

CLIMACOOL®,  a3®,  GROUND CONTROL SYSTEM™ AND THE
T-MAC 4 LACELESS FOOTWEAR TECHNOLOGIES DRIVE
INTEREST IN adidas SPORT PERFORMANCE /// Within the
adidas Sport Performance division,  our famous ClimaCool®
technology (see Brand Strategies) will be introduced at various price points and technology levels throughout the year.  In
particular,  this technology will be highlighted at the Summer
Olympics in August.  For ClimaCool®,  we are targeting sales of
four million pairs of shoes and five million pieces of apparel. 
In addition,  we will focus distribution of our premium running
product,  the a3® ULTRARIDE,  to vertical running retailersstarting in the second quarter of 2004.  In the second half of
the year,  we will introduce two completely new technologies
with the Ground Control System™,  our first major footwear
technology co-developed by adidas and Salomon (see Brand
Strategies) and the new T-MAC 4 Laceless Footwear Technology (see Brand Strategies).  While sales from these technologies are unlikely to exceed 10% of total adidas revenues in
2004,  we view them as a critical element of driving consumer
attention and demand for adidas products. 
RUNNING AND FOOTBALL CATEGORIES AS MAIN DRIVERS
FOR adidas SPORT PERFORMANCE GROWTH /// While new
technologies have a major impact on the image of the adidas
brand as a performance leader,  sales development in the
adidas Sport Performance division is always determined by
the performance of our five major sports categories: runningfootball,  basketball,  tennis and training.  In 2004,  we expect
running and football to be the major growth drivers for the
brand.  This reflects the expansion and commercialization of
our major footwear technologies,  which are largely targeted
at the running segment.  The football category will be positively impacted by the UEFA EURO 2004™ European Football
Championships in Portugal combined with our new products
for this event,  the Roteiro™ match ball,  and the innovative
football boots F50 and PredatorPulse™.  Further growth is
also expected in both the adidas Sport Heritage and Sport
Style divisions (see Brand Strategies). 

SALOMON BRINGS MAJOR INNOVATION TO BOTH SUMMER
AND WINTER CATEGORIES /// At Salomon,  major product
innovation is coming in both the winter and summer product
categories.  In the winter segment,  which currently comprises
the majority of sales,  new innovations such as the Scrambler™ and Streetracer® ski collections,  the ERA® snowboard
technology and the Spaceframe™ Course ski boot in the
second half of the year,  will help us extend our marketleading position in winter sports.  In summer products and
soft goods,  where we are targeting over-proportionate growth
in 2004,  the Ground Control System™ will be the leading
Salomon footwear technology.  Moreover,  an entirely new
Salomon apparel line will be introduced,  which we expect to
increase sales by around 50% in the category versus 2003 as
 result of expanded distribution and increased sourcing
efficiencies. 
NEW METALWOOD TO BE LAUNCHED AT TAYLORMADEadidas GOLF /// At TaylorMade-adidas Golf,  we will introduce
 revolutionary new metalwood in the summer of 2004.  As
metalwoods are the Group's highest-margin product category
and comprise nearly 50% of segment sales,  this introduction
will be an important contributor to TaylorMade-adidas Golf
top-line growth in 2004.  In addition,  new product introductions
or extensions are planned for other categories such as ironsgolf balls and putters.

MAJOR PROGRESS CONTINUES ON OTHER P&L ITEMS ///
adidas-Salomon is committed to being among the industry
leaders in all measures of profitability.  In 2004,  we again
expect improvements in gross margin,  operating margin and
net income.  With respect to gross margin,  the increased
proportion of higher-margin own-retail activities,  an improving product mix and lower clearance sales will be the primary
margin drivers.  We anticipate that the stronger euro will
continue to positively impact sourcing costs and therefore
also help to improve gross margin.  As a consequence,  there is
potential for the Group's gross margin to exceed 45% for the
first time ever.  We are also projecting operating margin
expansion,  which is our most important internal measure of
operational success.  Despite increases to marketing working
budget as a result of event-related spending in 2004,  we
expect continued savings in operating overheads and other
expenses which will be re-invested in own-retail activities. 
Consequently,  we will deliver a visible increase in Group
operating margin above the 2003 level of 78%.  Lastly,  we
expect over-proportionate growth in net earnings for the
fourth consecutive year.  The combination of underlying topline improvement,  a high gross margin and an improving
operating margin will help us achieve earnings growth of at
least 10% versus the prior year. 
DIVIDEND POLICY DEFINES PAYOUT IN 2004 /// The Group
has pursued a long-term,  earnings-linked dividend policy with
 payout ratio corridor of 15 to 20% of net income.  We expect
to maintain this policy in 2004. 

INVESTMENT LEVEL IN 2004 BETWEEN € 150 MILLION AND
€ 200 MILLION /// Capital expenditure for the Group is
expected to be at a level of between € 150 million and
€ 200 million in 2004.  Investments in tangible and intangible
assets will be used primarily for own-retail expansion as well
as for the increased deployment of SAP and other IT systems
in major subsidiaries within the Group.  The most important
factors in determining the exact level and timing of this
investment will be the rate at which we are able to successfully secure retail locations and integrate new SAP systems
within existing applications. 
FURTHER OPTIMIZATION OF FINANCIAL STRUCTURE AND
DEBT REDUCTION EXPECTED /// We are committed to continually improving the Group's financial structure and reducing
net debt levels.  Following our strong progress in 2003 (see
Group Management Report / Finance and Investment),  2004
advances will again be driven by improved operational performance as well as continued tight control of capital expenditure and working capital as a percentage of sales.  As a
result of these activities,  we expect to reduce total net borrowings by more than € 100 million again in 2004. 
SUPPLIER CONSOLIDATION AND PREPARATION FOR WTO AS
TOP PRIORITIES FOR GLOBAL OPERATIONS /// The manufacture of adidas-Salomon products is secured through numerous independent manufacturers around the world.  The supply
levels and prices for adidas-Salomon products are negotiated
approximately six months in advance.  As a result,  product
sourcing costs are fairly predictable for the next 12 months. 
In 2004,  one of our top priorities will be to further consolidate
this base of suppliers,  in order to strengthen both relationships and bargaining potential with key supply partners. 
Another key focus of our Global Operations team in tandem
with retail partners in 2004 will be to prepare for changes
relating to the expiration of World Trade Organization (WTO)
quotas as well as potential tariff reductions in key sourcing
countries.  This may have a disruptive impact on the industry
in the second half of 2004 but could potentially lead to a
reduction of both sourcing and retail costs during 2005.  Other
priorities for 2004 include further customization of supplychain solutions for key accounts and various initiatives
designed to increase the speed-to-market for our products
(see Global Operations). 

ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES EXPECTED IN MARKETING AND
adidas NORTH AMERICA /// Following the announcement of
Erich Stamminger as President and CEO of adidas America in
addition to his responsibilities as Head of Global Marketingwe expect some organizational changes during the first nine
months of 2004 to ensure optimal coordination of the two
units.  This includes the relocation of a small number of senior
marketing executives to North America,  primarily in the
technological innovation,  Sport Heritage and Sport Style
functions.  While continuous structural change to improve
efficiency and reduce hierarchy is an integral part of the
adidas-Salomon Management philosophy,  no other wide-scale
organizational changes are currently planned in 2004. 
OWN-RETAIL ACTIVITIES EXPECTED TO DRIVE PERSONNEL
INCREASES /// In 2004,  we project that the continued expansion of our own-retail activities will again be the major driver
of increased personnel requirements.  Personnel expenses
(including production) are expected to increase in line with the
number of newly hired employees in 2004. 
R&D SPENDING TO REMAIN FOCUSED ON TECHNOLOGICAL
INNOVATIONS /// In 2004,  adidas-Salomon will continue to
spend around € 90 million on research and development
associated with new products.  Areas of particular focus
include running,  basketball and football at brand adidas,  as
well as winter sports and golf hardware at Salomon and
TaylorMade-adidas Golf respectively.  Design-related
expenses,  which are separate from but often tightly integrated
with R&D spend,  will also remain at a similar level versus the
prior year.  The number of employees working in research and
development throughout the Group will remain relatively
stable at approximately 1000 in 2004.

EFFORTS IN SUPPLY CHAIN IMPROVEMENT.  IN ADDITION TO
OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS TEAM,  OUR SUPPLY CHAIN
INCLUDES RETAILERS,  SALES SUBSIDIARIES,  INDEPENDENT MANUFACTURERS,  RAW MATERIAL SUPPLIERSTRANSPORT COMPANIES,  FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS,  AND
MANY OTHERS INVOLVED IN GETTING OUR PRODUCTS TO

BE DIVIDED INTO TWO DIFFERENT CYCLES: PRODUCT
CREATION AND PROCUREMENT.  THE PRODUCT CREATION

PRODUCT CONCEPT TO PRODUCT OFFERING AND COMPRISES THE DESIGN,  DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF OUR PRODUCT.  THIS PART OF THE PROCESS
IS FOLLOWED BY THE PROCUREMENT CYCLE,  WHICH
INCLUDES ORDER MANAGEMENT,  MANUFACTURING AND

CREATION AND PROCUREMENT AREAS TO ACHIEVE
OPTIMAL EFFECTS IN TERMS OF QUALITY,  COSTS AND
DELIVERY PERFORMANCE. 

102 REPORTING

GLOBAL OPERATIONS

ALIGNING ACTIVITIES AND SHARING BEST PRACTICE ///
In 2003,  we have continued our efforts to consolidate the
footwear supply base to further increase efficiencies,  leading
to greater investment in technologies and innovation in both
product and manufacturing.  However,  the restructuring of
our apparel organization has been our priority in 2003 and
focuses on positioning our Group to benefit from the removal
of quotas which are set to occur over the next few years. 
While this has largely meant centralizing our sourcing operations,  in some cases it has been necessary or expedient,  as a
result of import restrictions or duties,  to continue sourcing
directly via our operating subsidiaries.  We therefore maintain
17 regional sourcing offices (liaison offices) in Asia,  Europe
and the Americas.  Their functions cover merchandising,  order
placement and monitoring,  as well as quality assurance and
on-site control of manufacturing facilities.  In order to facilitate quick decision-making and to optimize the balance
between quality,  product costs and delivery performance,  we
increased our on-site presence in 2003 by relocating some of
our Asian liaison offices from cities closer to the actual
production sites.  The relocation of the liaison offices is also
indicative of our future sourcing strategy,  which will rely on
fewer overall countries and the growing importance of China.

WORKING TOGETHER WITH SUPPLIERS TO ENSURE TOPQUALITY PRODUCTS /// Given that the vast majority of our
products are being produced by independent manufacturersthe relationship to our suppliers remains a critical factor to
both the outcome of our Global Operations activities and the
Group's overall success (see Risk Management).  The different
types of supplier we utilize can be categorized as follows:
> Main factories: Suppliers who have a direct contractual
business relationship with adidas-Salomon.  These companies manufacture our product for both export and local
market consumption. 
> Subcontractors: Companies that have been subcontracted
by our suppliers and do not have a direct business relationship with adidas-Salomon. 

Asia 95%

Asia 72%

> Material and other service providers: Companies which
may or may not have a direct business relationship with
adidas-Salomon,  but supply goods and services to the
main factories. 
In addition,  we have licensing arrangements with independent
companies who manage the design,  manufacture and distribution of specific product lines.  All of these suppliers are
provided with detailed specifications for the production and
delivery of our products.  In order to ensure the high quality
that the consumer expects from our product,  we enforce strict
quality control and inspection procedures.  Such procedures
include the regular presence of our more than 100 quality
control officers in these factories during the manufacturing
process. 
FOOTWEAR PRODUCTION DOMINATED BY ASIA /// Asia
continued to be our most important sourcing region in 2003. 
Approximately 95% of the adidas-Salomon footwear was
produced in this region with China,  Vietnam and Indonesia
having been the largest sourcing countries,  representing
approximately 53%,  24% and 18% of total footwear production
respectively.  Production in other Asian countries was below
1%,  while Europe and the Americas contributed 4 and 1%
respectively.  The largest footwear factory produced approximately 17% of the footwear purchased by adidas-Salomon
in 2003. 
APPAREL PRODUCTION AROUND THE GLOBE /// In appareltoo,  Asian countries dominated purchases in 2003.  Indonesia
and China again were the largest sourcing countries,  representing 18% and 17% of total apparel production.  The remaining 65% was produced by independent manufacturers in other
Asian countries,  Europe and the Americas with 37%,  20% and
8% respectively.  The largest apparel factory produced 5% of
our total apparel purchases in 2003. 

HARDWARE PRODUCED CLOSE TO MARKET /// With respect
to hardware,  adidas-Salomon focuses on producing close to
major markets.  Salomon hardware is largely manufactured
by subcontractors in Romania.  Additionally,  Salomon,  Mavic
and Cliché also maintain own production sites in Francewhich concentrate on high-end products and new technological developments.  The majority of TaylorMade's golf club
components are produced in China and then assembled by
TaylorMade in the major markets.  All golf balls marketed by
TaylorMade-adidas Golf are produced by the Dunlop
Slazenger group in the USA. 
CONSOLIDATING THE SUPPLIER BASE TO CUT COSTS AND
SPEED UP DELIVERY /// For 2004 and beyond,  we strive to
strengthen the relationships with our key supply partners by
further consolidating our supplier base.  This will give us more
influence with these vendors,  enabling us to better drive our
quality initiatives as well as our cost-saving and delivery
performance efforts.  Since 2000,  we have reduced the number
of our footwear suppliers by 40%.  In 2003 alone,  we were able
to reduce the number of our footwear suppliers by 9%.  In
apparel and hardware,  we initiated focused efforts in 2003
which have already started to pay off with a reduction of the
supplier base by 7 and 21% respectively. 
LEAN MANUFACTURING PRINCIPLES EXTENDED TO
APPAREL ACTIVITIES /// Reducing our lead times the time
elapsing for product creation,  order placement,  raw material
preparation,  manufacturing and delivering products to retail –
is a major priority within our Group as this enables us to
create products best tailored to meet current market needs
and improve customer service.  In addition,  it helps us to
reduce inefficiencies,  enhance quality,  minimize costs and
improve inventory management.  Until 2003,  our Global Operations activities had concentrated on reducing footwear lead
times.  In 2003,  however,  our primary focus was on reducing
apparel manufacturing lead times.  By expanding the lean
manufacturing principles that had proved successful in
footwear to our apparel organization (e.g.  improved labelingpackaging and special handling),  we were able to reduce our
apparel manufacturing lead times by 17% during the last 12
months.  Going forward,  we remain committed to achieving
further improvements in both footwear and apparel. 

SPECIAL PROJECTS TO REDUCE APPAREL LEAD TIMES ///
In addition to reducing overall apparel lead times,  our Global
Operations efforts also include a variety of projects targeting
specific areas of the business.  In order to increase our speedto-market specifically within our all-important football category we have introduced a special program aimed at reducing
the time between retailer purchase orders and product
delivery.  This has the benefit of increasing sales while reducing both the inventory carrying costs as well as close-out
sales.  The program has increased significantly since its
implementation three years ago.  In 2003,  we designed a
'5-4-3 model" with our biggest customers.  We are now able to
offer product timelines of five months from first concept to
shelf for new products,  four months for color upgrades of
existing models and three months for reorders.  The first
strategic partnership with one of our major retailers generated incremental business of more than 100000 units.  We
plan to extend this project to two additional customers in
early 2004. 
CUSTOMIZING THE SUPPLY CHAIN /// The creation of customized supply chain solutions is as important as lead-time
reduction.  In 2003,  we continued to make inroads with these
innovative supply chain solutions.  In Japan,  we were able to
work with factories and retailers throughout the supply chain
to provide manufacturing lead times as short as seven days. 
In addition to higher volumes,  this program allowed us to
capitalize on unique market and product opportunities as well
as to increase inventory turnover from factory to consumer.

OUR BENCHMARK /// adidas-Salomon's own code of conductthe Standards of Engagement (SOE),  is based on the conventions of the International Labor Organization (ILO) and the
model code of conduct of the World Federation of the Sporting
Goods Industry (WFSGI).  These are tools that assist us in
selecting and retaining business partners who follow workplace standards and business practices consistent with our
policies and values.  The SOE detail the Group's requirements
regarding labor,  health,  safety and environmental issues in
our suppliers' factories and form the foundation for our
international factory-monitoring program. 
ENSURING COMPLIANCE /// Before our suppliers can be
approved business partners,  they must show that their standards and conditions comply with the adidas-Salomon 'Standards of Engagement".  The Social & Environmental Affairs
(SEA) Team is responsible for monitoring compliance and
promoting best practice among our suppliers.  The SEA team
is comprised of 32 experts with specialized knowledge of the
labor laws,  workplace safety and environmental regulations in
the countries where they work.  SEA team members visit
suppliers at factory and subcontractor level internationally
and locally to monitor and determine compliance levels and
identify common problems,  with particular emphasis on
facilities which have been identified as high-risk.  Risk assessments cover a variety of factors,  including product typenumber of workers,  record of compliance and commitment to
standards.  During 2003,  906 audits involving management and
worker interviews in their native languages or with a local
translator,  document review and facility inspections were
conducted at different levels in our supply chain.  In the event
of non-compliance with our SOE,  factory management
together with our SEA team develops action plans and sets
deadlines for compliance and further improvements.  When a
factory continually fails to meet SOE standards,  business
relations are terminated.  This course of action is a last resort
and occurred four times in 2003.  However,  whenever possibleadidas-Salomon prefers to maintain partnership and to work
from the inside to help encourage factory improvements.

SUSTAINABILITY

VERIFYING RESULTS /// Through our participation in the Fair
Labor Association (FLA),  an independent monitoring organization headquartered in the USA,  adidas-Salomon externally
verifies the Group's global compliance activities.  adidasSalomon fully supports the FLA obligations including internal
auditing,  independent and unannounced monitoring,  consistent tracking of remedial actions,  and transparent communication of the process.  During the second year of the FLA
monitoring program,  independent auditors inspected
13 adidas-Salomon supplier factories.  Following the FLA
obligations,  adidas-Salomon also participated in the FLA
transparency program,  which includes publishing findings
from independent audits of seven major footwear and apparel
brands,  probing the protection of workers' rights in their
global operations on a factory-by-factory basis.  The FLA also
issued its first annual public report on the companies' monitoring and remediation efforts as they seek to come into
compliance with the FLA's Workplace Code of Conduct.  The
annual report is posted on the FLA website www, fairlabor, org. 
ENCOURAGING SELF-GOVERNANCE THROUGH MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS /// Our strategy is based on a long-term
vision of self-governance at our suppliers' factories.  Helping
them to become more sustainable requires building up capacities in their workforces and managements as well as in
independent local workers' organizations.  To achieve this,  our
activities continue to move from a monitoring role towards a
more support-based role.  This means working in partnership
with our suppliers and giving them guidance and training
where necessary.  We believe that good management systems
help factories improve their day-to-day operations and support the process of internalization and self-governance. 
Therefore,  we actively encourage our business partners to
pursue the opportunity for certification with internationally
recognized standards such as those of the International
Standardization Organization ISO 9000 and 14001 for quality
and environmental management and OHSAS 18000 (Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series).  At our production site in Scheinfeld,  Germany,  we established an environmental and quality management system that obtained a
certificate in accordance with the Environmental Management
and Audit Scheme of the European Union (EMAS II) and ISO
9000:2000.  There are three footwear suppliers' factories in
Asia certified to OHSAS 18000 and ISO 14001. 

TRAINING AND EDUCATION /// The long-term goal of our
strategy is that suppliers integrate the SOE into their own
systems.  Our training initiatives are designed to increase
factory management staff capacity so that their efforts to
improve working conditions become integral to the factory
management's style and sustainable over the long term.  In
2003,  the SEA Team conducted 206 training sessions and
workshops.  The training sessions took place in the suppliers'
own factories and in regional workshops.  The training activities on environmental best practices that were held in China
and Turkey were particular highlights. 
LISTENING TO STAKEHOLDERS /// We actively and systematically cooperate with our numerous stakeholders,  involving
them in key social and environmental decisions so that we
can best balance interests,  build consensus and enhance the
transparency of our business.  Stakeholders represent a very
diverse range of organizations,  groups and individuals and
include our shareholders,  concerned consumers,  employeesworkers in our suppliers' factories and non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) whom we affect and who affect us.  Over
the last two years,  formal stakeholder consultation meetings
have taken place in Asia,  the Americas and Europe on a
regular basis.  We have invited participants from other companies,  trade associations,  trade unions,  social investment
funds,  sustainability institutes,  universities,  certification
organizations,  and various NGOs involved in human rights to
participate.  Each meeting was moderated and recorded by
independent facilitators.  In 2003,  we further extended the
scope of stakeholder consultations and conducted additional
consultation meetings with workers from supplier factories in
Europe to receive their feedback about the Group's SOE
program. 

RECOGNITION /// adidas-Salomon is an industry leader on
sustainability issues.  In 2003,  after thorough analysis by Dow
Jones Sustainability Indexes of the Group's social,  environmental and financial performance,  adidas-Salomon was
included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes (DJSI) for the
fourth consecutive year.  The DJSI are global sustainability
indices which track the performance of leading sustainabilitydriven companies.  adidas-Salomon was additionally included
in the FTSE4Good Europe Index,  which selects companies on
the basis of ongoing commitment to environmental sustainability,  strong financial performance,  a positive relationship
with stakeholders and dedication to upholding and supporting
human rights.  Another highlight was that Ethibel,  the
Brussels-based CSR (corporate social responsibility) research
and advisory organization,  decided to select adidas-Salomon
for the Ethibel Investment Register.  The Ethibel Investment
Register is used as the basis for Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) products for a growing number of European banksfund managers and institutional investors.  The final decision
of the board of directors was based on two independent
surveys prepared by Stock at Stake,  Ethibel's research arm. 
Both the survey of the global sports footwear industry and the
sector study of the European textile,  apparel and luxury goods
industry clearly indicated adidas-Salomon as 'best in class"
in all fields of corporate social responsibility: social policy
(both internal and external),  environmental policy and economic policy.  According to the latest analysis conducted by
the rating agency INNOVEST in 2003,  adidas-Salomon has
been ranked as leader in CSR within the sporting goods and
garment industry.

 DIVERSE MIX OF BACKGROUNDS /// Another major part
of the Internal Code of Conduct deals with the respect of
personal dignity and differences.  In 2003,  45% of our total
employees were women and 55% were men.  Of the executive
management positions,  23% are held by women and 77% are
held by men.  Because a generally accepted definition for
minorities is non-existent in Europe,  adidas-Salomon is
unable to provide data in this respect.  At our headquarters in
Herzogenaurach,  we have more than 300 international
employees from over 40 countries.  And to ensure the Group's
closeness to the main target group,  our employees are young:
The average age is 33 years.  This pattern holds true for the
whole Group.  The majority of our employees work at brand
adidas.  Own production activities at Salomon,  howeverelevate their number of employees.  Regionally,  the employee
split largely reflects the respective proportion of sales within
the Group.  Despite our diverse backgrounds,  what unites
all adidas-Salomon employees is our passion for competition
and a sporting lifestyle.  (For information on the number
of employees and their functions,  please see Group Management Report / Group Business Performance. )

PERMANENT OBJECTIVE TO CREATE A WORKING ENVIRONMENT THAT STIMULATES TEAM SPIRIT AND PASSIONENGAGEMENT AND ACHIEVEMENT. 

OUR VALUES DEFINE OUR BEHAVIOR /// At adidas-Salomonwe believe that the core values of our brands such as authenticity,  inspiration,  commitment and honesty are represented
not only in our products,  but also in the way we work.  Based
on these values,  in 2003 we developed our 'Internal Code of
Conduct".  This Internal Code of Conduct is a compilation of
principles and formal policies,  such as a 'Prevention of
Corrupt Practices / Bribery Act",  which formerly existed in
separate formats.  Since 2003,  the Internal Code of Conduct
represents the central guidelines for our daily working life. 
The areas covered by this Code include the promotion of a
healthy and safe working place,  the careful utilization of
resources,  the protection of intellectual property as well as
the prevention of corrupt practices.  As part of our efforts
regarding transparency and good corporate governancetopics such as accurate accounting and financial reportingthe disclosure of potential conflicts of interest and the avoidance of insider trading have a prominent place in our Code.

REWARDING PERFORMANCE AND COMMITMENT /// To help
instill a performance culture,  based upon strong leadershipsetting the ground for winners,  we are implementing a comprehensive reward management system built on a homogeneous compensation philosophy and structure across the
Group. 
The Group's compensation system is composed of the following elements:
> A 'gross base salary": A fixed component based on the
responsibilities,  competencies and skills of the individual
employee. 
> Our 'pay for performance" bonus program: A performancebased component of salaries of eligible employees in
all areas within the Group.  More than 20% of all employees
receive a variable salary component with an average of
20% of their remuneration directly linked to individual and
Group performance. 
> Long-term incentive programs: These include our management stock option plan (MSOP) that links the compensation of approximately 450 key executives worldwide to
the development of the adidas-Salomon share price. 
Options from this program were exercised for the first time
in August 2002 as well as in November 2002 and May and
November 2003 (see note 32). 
> Other benefits: These include our 401-K pension plans in
the USA and the PP2000 pension program for employees in
Germany.  In 2003,  900 eligible employees participated in
the PP2000 program,  which represents an increase of 30%
compared to the prior year. 

WORK-LIFE BALANCE COMMITMENT /// Since having been
audited by the independent Hertie foundation in 2002,  we are
working in cross-functional groups at our headquarters to
address areas that have been identified for improvement to
achieve the certificate as a 'family-friendly company".  Our
activities have been commended by more then 25 German
companies and NGOs and,  in 2003,  an 'Exchange of Experience Summit" organized by the Hertie Foundation was hosted
by adidas-Salomon in Herzogenaurach,  to discuss our efforts
and further learn from each other.  One example of our activities here is our extensive fitness and wellness program in
which more then 1000 employees participate at our German
headquarters alone.  Other projects include holiday camps for
our employees' children.  We offered children of two age
groups an exciting week in Herzogenaurach with different
sports and educational activities during their summer holidays.  An extension of our care for our employees' children
during their school holidays is planned for the future.

GETTING SERIOUS ABOUT TALENT MANAGEMENT /// A
critical success factor for any modern company is its people
and their talent.  From a human capital management point of
view,  we created the talent management program 'Fit for
Gold",  that addresses career planning,  identification of qualified internal candidates and development of leadership
competencies.  One objective is to establish a more effective
form of internal recruitment,  which allows adidas-Salomon to
identify and develop succession candidates for senior management vacancies quickly and reliably.  At the same time,  we
aim to retain and motivate experienced employees through
visible investments in their progression.  Basic management
curricula and career pathing are elements of this program as
well as developing leadership skills.  A balanced learning
platform,  including e-learning,  classroom or on-the-job
training,  campus programs and coaching,  forms the training
ground for our educational activities.

Corporate Governance /// AS PART OF OUR ONGOING
EFFORTS TO ENSURE RESPONSIBLE AND VALUE-ORIENTED
CORPORATE MANAGEMENT,  IN 2003,  OUR GROUP CONTINUED TO STRENGTHEN OUR CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
ACTIVITIES.  THIS INCLUDED PUBLISHING OUR OWN CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES. 

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW
FROM GOVERNANCE TO ACTIONS /// In 2003,  we again made
major advances in our efforts to ensure transparent,  responsible and value-oriented corporate management.  In Februarywe published the adidas-Salomon Corporate Governance
Principles,  developed according to the requirements of our
Group and based on the German Corporate Governance Code
as well as on the recommendations of other internationally
recognized codes of best practice.  Further,  we appointed a
Corporate Governance Officer,  who reports directly to the
Executive and Supervisory Boards.  In March,  the Supervisory
Board established an Audit Committee within the Supervisory
Board to deal with matters relating to financial reporting and
risk management as well as the required independence of the
auditor and the determination of the main points of the audit
focus.  It was agreed with our auditors,  who participate in the
meetings of the Supervisory Board as well as the Audit
Committee,  that the Chairman of the Supervisory Board as
well as the Chairman of the Audit Committee will be informed
of any grounds for this disqualification or impartiality occurring during the audit,  unless such grounds are eliminated
immediately.  And in April 2003,  we published our annual
Declaration of Compliance with the German Corporate Governance Code.  In February 2004,  we issued a new Declaration to
reflect our compliance regarding changes made to the Code
in May 2003. 
ENHANCING SHAREHOLDERS' RIGHTS /// To encourage
maximum interest in the Annual General Meeting,  we offer a
video transmission in German and English of the Annual
General Meeting in its entirety on the corporate websiteincluding the discussion between our shareholders and the
Management,  as far as the shareholders concerned give their
approval.  In addition,  we provide those shareholders who
cannot attend the meeting in person with the possibility to
exercise their voting rights by giving their voting instructions
in writing and,  starting in 2004 via Internet,  to proxies
appointed by adidas-Salomon.  More information about this
procedure is available with the invitation to the Annual
General Meeting on the corporate website.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

DIRECTORS' DEALINGS AND CHANGES IN SHAREHOLDER
STRUCTURE /// Pursuant to §15 a of the German Securities
Trading Act (WpHG),  our Executive and Supervisory Boards
are required to disclose without delay the purchase and sale
of adidas-Salomon shares in the event such transactions
exceed € 25000 for any one member and his or her immediate family within a period of 30 days.  We immediately make
this information available in the corporate governance section
of our corporate website.  In 2003,  only Christian Tourres,  a
member of our Supervisory Board,  informed us of such
transactions (see note 35).  In accordance with § 25 of the
German Securities Trading Act,  we communicate if the shareholdings of individual Executive Board and Supervisory Board
members directly or indirectly exceed 5% of the shares issued
by adidas-Salomon. 
REMUNERATION OF THE BOARDS /// In accordance with its
Rules of Procedure,  our Supervisory Board has assigned the
responsibility to determine the compensation structure and
performance of the Executive Board to its General Committee. 
As this system has proven successful,  the General Committee
that also deals in detail with the performance of the Executive
Board members will continue to discuss and resolve upon the
structure of compensation of the Executive Board.  Of coursewe are committed to publishing the structure of the compensation system. 

STRUCTURE OF EXECUTIVE BOARD REMUNERATION /// The
total remuneration of the members of the Executive Board
consists of fixed and variable components,  as well as benefits
in kind (e.g.  a company car) and stock options.  In addition,  the
Board receives pension entitlements.  In 2003,  the fixed annual
salary represented approximately 42% of the annual compensation,  while 56% were performance-oriented and linked to
the success of the adidas-Salomon Group.  The remaining 2%
included benefits in kind.  Criteria for determining the level of
compensation include the responsibilities and the contribution of the respective Board member,  his own personal
performance as well as the performance of the entire Executive Board,  the Group's economic and financial position and
the outlook of the Group.  Longer-term goals are also taken
partially into consideration.  The variable components are
structured in such a way as to represent a clear incentive to
achieve the defined goals. 
As a variable compensation component with a long-term
incentive effect and with risk character,  members of the
Executive Board have received stock options under a management stock option plan (MSOP) adopted by the Annual General Meeting on May 20,  1999 and amended by resolution of
the Annual General Meeting on May 8,  2002.  Approximately
10% of the total issue volume authorized by the Annual
General Meeting were granted to Executive Board members. 
The stock options are exercisable within the three years
following a two-year vesting period,  provided that at least one
of the following performance objectives has been attained:
> During the period between the issue and exercise of the
stock options,  the stock market price for the adidasSalomon share has increased by an annual average of at
least 8% ('absolute performance"). 
> Between the issue and exercise of the stock options,  the
stock market price for the adidas-Salomon share has
developed by an annual average of 1% more favorably than
the stock market prices of a basket of competitors of
adidas-Salomon globally and in absolute terms has not
fallen ('relative performance"). 
The compensation from the stock option plan consists of a
performance discount which is composed of the absolute and
relative performance components.  The value of the optionsbased compensation consists exclusively of a performance
discount. 

EXECUTIVE BOARD REMUNERATION IN 2003 /// We believe
that publication of the individual compensation of Executive
Board members would not provide additional information with
relevance for the capital markets and that it is more meaningful to report the compensation structure as a whole.  Moreover,  individualized disclosure would infringe upon Board
members' right to privacy. 
In 2003,  there were only a few stock options left for distribution.  The Supervisory Board therefore did not grant any
options to members of the Executive Board,  but only to the
other beneficiaries of the stock option plan.  The number of
outstanding stock options held by the current members of the
Executive Board as at December 31,  2003 totaled 127600
options.  5000 options were exercised in 2003.  As all stock
options were granted prior to the amendments made to the
Code in May 2003,  a possibility of limitation (cap) for extraordinary,  unforeseeable developments does not exist.  In
addition,  the management stock option plan features such
challenging exercise hurdles that a limitation appears to be
dispensable.  Further,  no members of the Executive Board
were granted loans by adidas-Salomon in 2003.

SUPERVISORY BOARD REMUNERATION IN 2003 /// The
remuneration of the individual Supervisory Board members is
defined in § 18 of the adidas-Salomon Articles of Associationresolved upon by our shareholders.  Accordingly,  each Supervisory Board member receives fixed annual compensation (in
addition to reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses) in the
amount of € 21000.  The Chairman receives € 42000,  and the
two Deputy Chairmen each receive compensation in the
amount of € 31500,  so that the total compensation paid to the
members of the Supervisory Board in 2003 was € 294000. 
Supervisory Board members who are members for a portion
of the year receive compensation on a pro rata basis.  In order
to ensure their independent judgment,  Supervisory Board
members receive solely fixed remuneration that is not linked
to the Group's financial performance.  Further,  no additional
compensation is paid for chairmanship or membership of
Supervisory Board committees as we do not believe that it
would further improve the commitment to committee work. 
In addition,  we consider it to be a good compromise between
ensuring transparency and respecting privacy to state the
aggregate payments made for advisory and consultancy work
as well as the number of members rendering such work.  In
2003,  two members of the Supervisory Board received a total
of € 05 million for advisory services.  No members of the
Supervisory Board were granted loans by adidas-Salomon
in 2003. 

COMPLIANCE WITH THE GERMAN CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE /// Our corporate governance working groupconsisting of members of the Executive and Supervisory
Boards,  examined the Code,  the existing deviations from the
Code as well as the amendments made to the Code in May
2003.  We decided to maintain the existing deviations that we
reported in the Declaration of Compliance of April 2003 and
not to follow all new recommendations of the Code as we
consider some of them to be inappropriate for our Group.  For
instance,  we will continue to dispense with an age limit for
our Board members as we believe it would narrow the rights
of the shareholders to elect their representatives to the Supervisory Board.  Likewise,  it could potentially restrict the Supervisory Board in its responsibility to appoint the best qualified
candidates to the Executive Board.  Additionally,  alongside the
fact that a deductible is not common outside Germany,  we do
not regard D&O liability insurance with a deductible for Board
members as appropriate,  since adidas-Salomon senior managers,  both in and outside Germany,  are covered by a Group
insurance policy.  It does not seem appropriate to differentiate
between Board members and other high-level personnel.  In
light of the amendments made to the Code in May 2003,  the
Executive and Supervisory Boards issued an updated Declaration of Compliance on February 10,  2004. 

110 REPORTING CORPORATE GOVERNANCE /// CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW

2004 DECLARATION OF COMPLIANCE /// The Executive Board
and the Supervisory Board of adidas-Salomon AG issued the
previous Declaration of Compliance in accordance with § 161
of the German Stock Corporation Act on April 7,  2003.  During
the period between April 7,  2003 and May 21,  2003,  the date of
publication of the amendments of the German Corporate
Governance Code,  adidas-Salomon AG has complied with all
recommendations of the 'Government Commission German
Corporate Governance Code" with the exceptions stated

the German Corporate Governance Code with the additional
and respectively marked exceptions:
> adidas-Salomon's D&O liability insurance does not include
 deductible for Executive Board and Supervisory Board
members (Article 38). 
> Compensation of Executive Board members is reported in

> Stock options granted to Executive Board members in
connection with the management stock option plan (MSOP)
do not provide a possibility of limitation (cap) for extraordinary,  unforeseeable developments.  The compensation
report does not include information on the value of stock
options (Article 423).  1)
> adidas-Salomon does not specify age limits for Executive
Board members and Supervisory Board members (Articles
512 and 541). 
> The compensation of the Supervisory Board members
consists only of a fixed compensation component and does
not consider the membership in Supervisory Board committees.  Compensation paid to the members of the Supervisory Board for advisory or agency services rendered is
reported in total (Article 545). 

> The structure of the Executive Board compensation system
is reviewed and determined by the General Committee
(Article 422).  1)
> The shareholdings of individual Executive Board and
Supervisory Board members are reported if these directly
or indirectly exceed 5% of the shares issued by the Company.  The entire holdings are reported separately according
to Executive Board and Supervisory Board if the entire

OUTLOOK /// Good corporate governance is not a one-time
action.  On the contrary,  it must be continually improved and
updated in response to new laws,  standards and market
conditions.  Our Corporate Governance Officer regularly
monitors the conformity of adidas-Salomon with compliance
rules and reports to the Executive and Supervisory Boards.  In
2004,  we will enable our shareholders to exercise their voting
rights at the Annual General Meeting via our website.  In
addition,  we will also issue an update of the adidas-Salomon
Corporate Governance Principles.  These are only some of the
steps we will take in order to achieve better and more transparent corporate governance.

Supervisory Board Report ///

112 REPORTING CORPORATE GOVERNANCE /// SUPERVISORY BOARD REPORT

DEAR SHAREHOLDERS /// In the year under review,  the
Supervisory Board of adidas-Salomon AG dealt in detail with
the business development,  the financial position and the
strategic orientation of the adidas-Salomon Group.  We regularly advised the Executive Board and monitored corporate
management.  The Executive Board kept us regularly informed
about the position of the Group,  corporate policy and matters
relating to major business transactions by means of detailed
verbal and written reports.  We were directly involved in all
decisions of fundamental importance. 
In five joint meetings with the Executive Board,  the Supervisory Board reviewed in detail the business and financial
development of the adidas-Salomon Group as well as the
individual operational units and the major Group companies. 
Furthermore,  the Chairman of the Supervisory Board also
maintained regular contact with the Executive Board between
the Supervisory Board meetings and was kept informed about
the current business situation.  The external auditor attended
the annual financial statements meeting of the Supervisory
Board and the meetings where the quarterly financial statements were presented.  The meeting attendance rate of the
Supervisory Board members at all Supervisory Board meetings in 2003 was 100%.  The Supervisory Board approved
urgent transactions in three resolutions by way of circular
vote. 

MAIN TOPICS COVERED BY THE SUPERVISORY BOARD ///
The development of sales and earnings of the adidasSalomon Group and the individual operational units and the
Group's financial position was the subject of regular consultations within the Supervisory Board.  At the beginning of the
year,  we approved the annual budget and investment plan for
the adidas-Salomon Group.  In this context,  we discussed in
depth the development of the adidas operational unit in
Europe and progress of the 'Winning in Europe" project which
is leading to visible cost savings as well as both sales and
earnings growth.  Furthermore,  following intensive deliberations,  the Supervisory Board approved the adidas-Salomon
Corporate Governance Principles,  thereby setting an important milestone for transparent corporate governance.  In
March,  the main focus of our consultations was the financial
statements and consolidated financial statements for the year
ending December 31,  2002 and the setting up of an Audit
Committee.  In May,  the Supervisory Board approved the
issuance of the final tranche of the stock option plan (MSOP)
for management executives of adidas-Salomon AG and its
affiliated companies.  In August,  the Executive Board reported
to us in detail about business development and future business strategy in North America.  Further,  we discussed in
detail the key financial points of a participation in the bidding
process to acquire the Top-Flite brand in the golf ball sector. 
In view of the fact that the purchase price offered by a competitor was well above the valuation made by the Executive
Board,  we subsequently withdrew from the bidding process. 
Additionally,  the Executive Board informed us about further
expansion of adidas-Salomon's new headquarters,  the World
of Sports.  We approved the investments required for the
Group's growth. 

COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES /// In the year under review,  the
Supervisory Board had three standing committees and a
'Convertible Bond / Bond with Warrants" Committee which
was established for a limited period of time.  The members of
the respective committees are shown in the section listing
the Supervisory Board members. 
The General Committee dealt with personnel matters
related to the Executive Board on seven occasions in 2003,  in
meetings and in resolutions by way of circular vote. 
The Audit Committee,  established in July 2003,  met three
times in the year under review.  The Audit Committee and the
auditor discussed in detail the limited scope review of the
financial statements for the first half year and dealt with the
financial statements for the third quarter.  The Committee also
discussed additional audit priorities and the fee arrangement
for the auditor.  The Supervisory Board plenum was always
informed in detail about the matters discussed at the meetings of the Audit Committee. 
The Mediation Committee,  formed in accordance with
§ 27 section 3 of the German Co-Determination Act
(MitBestG),  submits proposals to the Supervisory Board
regarding the appointment or dismissal of Executive Board
members if the two-thirds Supervisory Board majority necessary for an appointment / dismissal is not achieved.  This
committee did not meet in 2003. 
The Supervisory Board 'Convertible Bond / Bond with
Warrants" Committee,  set up in August for a limited period of
time,  discussed in detail the structure and conditions of the
convertible bond issued in October and the exclusion of
shareholders' preemptive rights,  and thereupon approved
issuance of the bond. 
EXAMINATION OF THE 2003 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS /// KPMG
Deutsche Treuhand-Gesellschaft Aktiengesellschaft
Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft,  Frankfurt am Main,  audited
the financial statements of adidas-Salomon AG for the year
under review as prepared by the Executive Board in line with
the provisions of the German Commercial Code (HGB) as well
as the management report.  The auditor issued an unqualified
opinion thereon. 

As in the previous year,  the consolidated financial statements were prepared in compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).  Under the provisions of
§ 292a HGB,  these financial statements exempt adidasSalomon AG from drawing up consolidated financial statements in accordance with German Commercial Law.  The
auditor issued an unqualified opinion on the consolidated
financial statements and the Group management report. 
The financial statements and the auditor's reports were
presented to all the members of the Supervisory Board in a

The Executive Board of adidas-Salomon AG is responsible for the compilation,  completeness and
accuracy of the Group's annual consolidated financial statements,  the description of the economic
development and the Group management report as well as the other information presented in
the annual report.  The consolidated financial statements 2003 were prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) adopted by the International Accounting
Standards Board (IASB).  The consolidated financial statements also comply with § 292a German
Commercial Code (HGB),  which exempts adidas-Salomon AG from the obligation of reporting consolidated financial statements under German GAAP.  The Group management report additionally
complies with the requirements of the German Commercial Code (HGB). 
To ensure accuracy and reliability of the underlying information,  the content of the consolidated
financial statements is based on the information reported in accordance with Group-wide uniform
guidelines which are consistent for all companies included in consolidation.  The integrity of the
reporting process and risk management systems is safeguarded by effective internal control systems established under the direction of the Executive Board which is in compliance with the German Act regarding the Control and Transparency of Company Divisions (KonTraG).  These control
systems form an essential part of our value-oriented management style.  As a consequence,  a true
and fair view of the Group's financial position,  results of operations and cash flows and its reporting
thereon is assured and the Executive Board is in a position to recognize potential investment risks
and negative developments at an early stage and take appropriate countermeasures. 
In accordance with a resolution adopted by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in
2003,  KPMG Deutsche Treuhand-Gesellschaft Aktiengesellschaft WirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaftFrankfurt,  was appointed as independent auditor to audit adidas-Salomon's consolidated financial
statements and Group management report contained in this annual report.  The Supervisory Board

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT ///
We have audited the consolidated financial statements,  comprising the consolidated balance sheetthe consolidated income statement and the notes to the consolidated financial statements and the
statements of changes in shareholders' equity as well as cash flows prepared by adidas-Salomon AG
for the business year from January 1 to December 31,  2003.  The preparation and the content of the
consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS) are the responsibility of the Company's Management.  Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with German
auditing regulations and German generally accepted standards for the audit of financial statements
promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW).  Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit such that it can be assessed with reasonable assurance whether the consolidated
financial statements are free of material misstatements.  Knowledge of the business activities and
the economic and legal environment of the Group and evaluations of possible misstatements are
taken into account in the determination of audit procedures.  The evidence supporting the amounts
and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements is examined on a test basis within the
framework of the audit.  The audit includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by Management,  as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated
financial statements.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In our opinion,  the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the net assetsfinancial position,  results of operations and cash flows of the adidas-Salomon Group for the business year in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. 
Our audit,  which also extends to the group management report prepared by the Company's
Management for the business year from January 1 to December 31,  2003,  has not led to any
reservations.  In our opinion on the whole the group management report provides a suitable understanding of the Group's position and suitably presents the risks of future development.  In additionwe confirm that the consolidated financial statements and the group management report for
the business year from January 1 to December 31,  2003 satisfy the conditions required for the
Company's exemption from its duty to prepare consolidated financial statements and the group
management report in accordance with German law.

Four subsidiaries have not been included in the consolidated financial statements in 2003
(2002: eight subsidiaries),  since they have little or no active business and are insignificant to the
Group's financial position,  results of operations and cash flows.  The shares in these companies are
accounted at cost. 
 schedule of the shareholdings of adidas-Salomon AG is shown in Attachment I to these
notes.  A collective listing of these shareholdings in accordance with § 285 No.  11 and § 313 section
 and 3 of the German Commercial Code will be filed with the Commercial Register at the Local
Court in Fürth (Bavaria). 
Consolidation of equity is made in compliance with the book value method by offsetting the
initial investments in subsidiaries against the relevant equity portion at fair value held by the parent
company as at acquisition date. 
All significant intercompany transactions and balances,  and any unrealized gains and losses
arising from intercompany transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial
statements. 

Currency Translation
Assets and liabilities of the Group's non-euro functional currency subsidiaries are translated into
euro at closing exchange rates at the balance sheet date.  Revenues and expenses are translated
at the average exchange rates for the year.  All cumulative differences from the translation of equity
of foreign subsidiaries resulting from changes in exchange rates are included in a separate item
within shareholders' equity without affecting income. 
In the individual financial statements of Group companies,  monetary items denominated in a
non-euro currency are generally measured at closing exchange rates at the balance sheet date. 
The resulting currency gains and losses are recorded directly in income. 
 summary of exchange rates to euro for major currencies in which the Group operates is as

Derivative Financial Instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments,  interest and currency options,  as well as forward
contracts,  to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks.  In accordance with its
treasury policy,  the Group does not hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. 
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognized in the balance sheet at cost and subsequently measured at their fair value.  The method of recognizing the resulting gain or loss is
dependent on the nature of the item being hedged.  On the date a derivative contract is entered intothe Group designates certain derivatives as either a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or
liability (fair value hedge),  a hedge of a forecasted transaction (cash flow hedge) or a hedge of a net
investment in a foreign entity. 

Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedgesand that are 100% effective,  are recognized in equity.  If the effectiveness is not 100%,  the deviating
amounts are recognized in net income.  Amounts deferred in equity are transferred to the income
statement in the same periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects the income
statement.  For derivative instruments designated as a fair value hedge,  the gain or loss on the
derivative and the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item are recognized immediately in net
income. 
Certain derivative transactions,  while providing effective economic hedges under the Group's
risk management policies,  do not qualify for hedge accounting under the specific rules of IAS 39. 
Changes in the fair values of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting
under IAS 39 are recognized immediately in the income statement. 
Hedges of net investments in foreign entities are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. 
If the hedging instrument is a derivative (e.  g.  a forward contract) or,  for example,  a foreign currency
borrowing,  any currency gains and losses in the derivative as well as all gains and losses arising on
the translation of the borrowing are recognized in equity. 
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging
instruments and hedged items,  as well as the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.  This process includes linking all derivatives designated as
hedges to specific forecasted transactions.  The Group also documents its assessment,  both at the
hedge inception and on an ongoing basis,  whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items. 
The fair values of forward contracts and currency options are determined on the basis of the
market conditions on the reporting dates.  The fair value of a currency option is determined using
generally accepted models to calculate option prices.  The fair market value of an option is influenced not only by the remaining term of the option but also by further determining factors,  such as
the actual foreign exchange rate and the volatility of the underlying foreign currency base.  The fair
values of interest rate options on the reporting date are assessed by the financial institutions
through which these options were arranged. 
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents represent cash and short-term bank deposits with maturities of three
months and less. 
Receivables
Receivables are stated at nominal amounts less allowances for doubtful accounts.  These
allowances are determined on the basis of individual risk assessment and past experience of
losses. 

129

Inventories
Merchandise and finished goods are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value.  Costs are
determined using a standard valuation method which approximates the first-in,  first-out method or
the average cost method.  Costs of finished goods include cost of raw materials,  direct labor and
manufacturing overheads.  The lower of cost or net realizable value allowances are computed consistently throughout the Group based on the age and expected future sales of the items on hand. 
Investment Property Held-for-Sale
Investment property held-for-sale is measured initially at cost.  For subsequent measurement,  the
Group applies the cost model. 
Property,  Plant and Equipment
Property,  plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.  Depreciation is
computed on a declining balance or straight-line basis on useful lives as follows:

Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets
Acquired goodwill and intangible assets are valued at cost less accumulated amortization. 
Goodwill is the excess of the purchase cost over the fair value of the identifiable assets and
liabilities acquired.  Goodwill arising from the acquisition of a foreign entity and any fair value
adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities of that foreign entity are treated as
assets of the reporting entity and are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the date of the
initial consolidation. 
Amortization is calculated on a straight-line basis with the following useful lives:

5–20

Patents,  trademarks and concessions

Expenditures for internally generated intangible assets are generally expensed as incurred
since they do not qualify for recognition. 

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.  Significant renewals and
improvements are capitalized. 
Impairment
In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the costs of long-lived assets are impairedan evaluation of recoverability is performed.  An exceptional write-down is made if the carrying
amount exceeds the recoverable amount. 
Finance Leases
If under a lease agreement substantially all risks and rewards associated with an asset are transferred to the Group,  the asset less accumulated depreciation and the corresponding liability are
recognized at the fair value of the asset or the lower net present value of the minimum lease
payments. 

130 FINANCIAL ANALYSIS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (IFRS) /// NOTES

Research and Development
Research costs are expensed as incurred.  Development costs are also expensed as incurred and
are not capitalized due to the short product life cycle of sporting goods. 
The Group spent approximately € 86 million and € 85 million on product research and development for the years ending December 31,  2003 and 2002 respectively. 
Investments
The Group classifies its investments into the following categories: trading,  held-to-maturity and
available-for-sale. 
During the reporting period,  the Group did not hold any trading or held-to-maturity
investments. 
Investments intended to be held for an undefined period of time,  which may be sold in
response to liquidity needs or changes in interest rates,  are classified as available-for-sale. 
Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of
purchase and re-evaluates such designations on a regular basis. 
All purchases and sales of investments are recognized on the trade date.  Costs of purchases
include transaction costs.  If the fair value of available-for-sale investments can be measured
reliably,  they are subsequently carried at fair value.  Realized and unrealized gains and losses
arising from changes in the fair value of these investments are included in the income statement of
the period in which they arise.  Equity securities for which fair values cannot be measured reliably
are recognized at cost less impairment. 

Borrowings
Borrowings are recognized initially at the proceeds received,  net of transaction costs incurred.  In
subsequent periods,  borrowings are stated at amortized cost using the effective interest method. 
Any difference between proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognized
in the income statement over the terms of the borrowings. 
When convertible bonds are issued,  the fair value of the liability component is determined
using a market interest rate for a comparable straight bond; this amount is presented under
long-term borrowings on the amortized cost basis until conversion or maturity of the bond.  The
remaining portion is included in shareholders' equity; the value of the equity component is not
changed in subsequent periods. 
Other Liabilities
Other liabilities are recorded at their settlement amount. 
Provisions
Provisions are recognized where a present legal or constructive obligation has been incurred
which is likely to lead to an outflow of resources which can be reasonably estimated. 
Pensions and Similar Obligations
Provisions for pensions and similar obligations comprise the provision obligation of the Group
under defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans.  The obligation under defined benefit
plans is determined using the projected unit credit method in accordance with IAS 19 (revised
2000).  The Group does not recognize actuarial gains or losses of defined benefit plans as income
and expenses according to the corridor approach of IAS 1992 (revised 2000) within the range of
10% of the present value of the defined benefit obligation. 
Recognition of Revenues
Sales are recorded net of returns,  discounts,  allowances and sales taxes when title passes based
on the terms of the sale. 
Royalty and commission income is recorded based on the terms of the contracts. 
Advertising and Promotional Expenditures
Production costs for media campaigns are shown under prepaid expenses until the advertising
takes place for the first time,  after which they are expensed in full.  Significant media buying costs
(e.  g.  broadcasting fees) are expensed over the original duration of the campaign on a straight-line
basis. 
Promotional expenses,  including one-time up-front payments for promotional contracts,  are
expensed pro rata over the term of the agreement. 

Interest
Interest is recognized as an expense or income as incurred. 
Income Taxes
Current income taxes are computed in accordance with the rules for taxation established in the
countries in which the Group operates. 
The Group computes deferred taxes for all temporary differences between the carrying amount
and the tax basis of its assets and liabilities and tax loss carryforwards. 
Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences and tax loss carryforwards
which exceed taxable temporary differences are only recognized to the extent that it is probable that
the company concerned will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the associated benefit. 
Equity Compensation Benefits
Share options are granted to members of the Executive Board of adidas-Salomon AG as well as
to the Managing Directors /Senior Vice Presidents of its affiliated companies and to further
senior executives of the Group in connection with the management stock option plan (MSOP) of
adidas-Salomon AG.  The Company has the choice to settle a possible obligation by issuing new
shares or providing the equivalent cash compensation.  When options are exercised and the
Company decides to issue new shares,  the proceeds received net of any transaction costs are
credited to share capital and capital surplus,  and no personnel expenses are recorded.  In the case
of a cash settlement,  the difference between the exercise price and the fair value of the shares is
debited to income. 
Long-term Incentive Plans
The Group has established various long-term incentive plans which offer key employees stockbased compensation,  including stock appreciation rights ('SARs").  Compensation costs for the
difference between the exercise price and the fair value of the SARs are recognized in the financial
statements when the SARs are exercised. 
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of assumptions
and estimates that affect reported amounts and related disclosures.  Although such estimates
are based on Management's best knowledge of current events and actions,  actual results may
ultimately differ from these estimates.

 /// FRAMEWORK FOR ACCOUNTING POLICIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH IFRS AND EXPLANATION
OF MAJOR DIFFERENCES COMPARED WITH GERMAN ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The major differences between the accounting policies and consolidation methods according to
IFRS and German law as set out in § 292a section 2 No.  4b of the German Commercial Code (HGB)
are outlined below. 

Deferred Taxes
Deferred tax assets must be included to their full extent.  This also applies to tax loss carryforwardswhich can be offset against future profits for tax purposes and which are thus to be reflected as
deferred tax assets.  Deferred tax assets are reviewed for their realization regularly and are written
down if appropriate. 

a) Framework for Accounting Policies in Accordance with IFRS
The accounting policies of entities in accordance with IFRS are based on the objective of providing
investors with decision-relevant information. 
Based on the assumption that decision-relevant information should be provided to investors,  it
follows that accounting policies should be aimed at showing an entity's operating results,  rather
than determining the amount of distributable profits,  whilst bearing in mind the need for protection
of creditors. 
As a rule,  accounting policies in accordance with IFRS have a lower level of prudence than
German accounting policies,  which leads to the following major differences:
> Minimization of possibilities for establishing and releasing hidden reserves. 
> The consistency requirement (recognition,  valuation,  classification,  consolidation) is to be strictly
followed; changes in accounting policies are only permitted if it can be proven that the change
leads to an improvement in the fair presentation of the financial statements. 
> Economic substance has precedence over legal form.  The principle of substance over form has a
stronger influence in accounting policies in accordance with IFRS than in German GAAP. 

Pension Provisions
Pension provisions are calculated actuarially using the projected unit credit method.  Use of the
German tax-based entry-age-normal method (§ 6a German Income Tax Act EStG) is not
permitted. 
Expected wage and salary increases until pensionable age are considered when calculating
the pension liability to beneficiaries under the scheme.  Capital market interest rates are used to
discount the amounts,  which can partly offset this increase,  as the rate can be higher than the
6% used for tax purposes in Germany (§ 6a EStG).  Pension provisions are calculated for beneficiaries as soon as they become scheme members.  Appropriate fluctuation rates should be used when
considering the provisions needed for this group of beneficiaries. 

b) Description of Major Differences in Accounting Policies Compared with German Accounting
Policies
The major differences in accounting policies in accordance with IFRS compared with German
accounting policies in the consolidated financial statements of the Group are as follows:
Unrealized Profits Included in the Income Statement
Although the realization principle is a specific part of IFRS,  in contrast to German accounting
policies 'unrealized" profits must be included in the income statement in certain cases.  The
following balance sheet items are translated at prevailing year-end foreign exchange rates even if
this leads to an 'unrealized" profit compared with using the exchange rate at the booking date:
> Foreign currency receivables and liabilities
> Derivative financial instruments to the extent they do not represent a hedge
> Available-for-sale securities 
132 FINANCIAL ANALYSIS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (IFRS) /// NOTES

Other Provisions and Accruals
Provisions and accruals may only be set up to cover obligations to third parties.  Internal accruals
are not permitted. 
Accounting for Leases
In contrast to the use of German tax-based leasing provisions,  IFRS requirements more often lead
to leased items being recognized in the balance sheet of the lessee rather than of the lessor.  IFRS
requires the contractual party which is the economic owner and which thus has the major share of
risks and opportunities arising from the use of the item being leased to recognize the lease in its

PROPERTY,  PLANT AND EQUIPMENT € in thousands 
Prepaid expenses relate mainly to promotion agreements and service contracts. 
Investment property held-for-sale relates to parts of land of the former 'Herzo Base" in
Herzogenaurach.  This land,  owned by the GEV Grundstücksgesellschaft Herzogenaurach mbH
& Co.  KG,  was bought (through acquisition of 90% of the shares) in 1998. 
 portion is being used for the development of adidas-Salomon's international headquarters
'World of Sports",  and is included under property,  plant and equipment.  The remaining part,  not
needed in the future by adidas-Salomon,  has a size of 77 hectares and is to be sold.  According to the
'Urban Design Contract",  signed with the town Herzogenaurach in December 2001,  the land is to
be split into a housing area (31 hectares),  an industrial area (19 hectares),  a public area (24 hectares)
and other areas (3 hectares).  Furthermore,  GEV has to undertake specified opening and development measures as well as to transfer a small portion of land to the town Herzogenaurach at
predetermined conditions. 
The fair value of this investment property cannot be determined reliably at the current timeas the land is not yet fully developed and building permits exist only partially.  However,  the Group
estimates that the fair value for the land could be a mid-double-digit million euro amount. 
To secure an appropriate market value,  the Group continued in 2003 to pursue development
and commercialization under the control of GEV as decided in 2002.  In 2003,  GEV sold the first
pieces of land.  The development and sale of the complete area is expected to occur within the next
12 to 15 years.

Long-term financial assets include a 10% participation in FC Bayern München AG of € 77 million
which was concluded in July 2002.  This participation is recorded at cost including transaction costsas this equity security does not have a quoted market price in an active market and other methods
of reasonably estimating fair value as at December 31,  2003 and 2002 were inappropriate or unworkable.  Additionally,  financial assets comprise shares in unconsolidated affiliated companies of
€ 3 million at December 31,  2003 and 2002. 
Long-term financial assets further include investments which are mainly related to a deferred
compensation plan (see note 18).  These are mainly invested in insurance products and are measured at fair value. 

Prepaid expenses mainly include prepayments for long-term promotional contracts and service
contracts (see also notes 22 and 31). 
15 /// BORROWINGS AND CREDIT LINES
Despite the decline of borrowings in 2003,  it has been the policy of the Group to continue a high
level of financing agreements,  with further improvement in the structure and maturity profile of
these arrangements.  The Group has continued its diversification among different sources of financing and succeeded in increasing its funding through private placements to € 684 million (2002:
€ 560 million),  with maturities of up to 12 years.  A € 400 million convertible bond with final maturity in 2018 and an interest rate of 25% was issued.  On the other hand,  the Group temporarily
suspended its commercial paper programs and prematurely repaid private placements with remaining short maturities in the total amount of € 31 million.  The global on-balance-sheet assetbacked security (ABS) program,  under which € 109 million were outstanding at the end of 2003
(2002: € 147 million),  was not extended further and now has a remaining life of four years. 
Gross borrowings declined in 2003 by € 349 million (2002: € 192 million).  As all borrowings
with short-term maturities which are backed by longer-term arrangements are reported as longterm borrowings,  the Group does not report short-term borrowings.  The reported amount of
longer-term borrowings therefore includes bank borrowings,  commercial paper,  financing under
the ABS program,  private placements as well as the convertible bond. 
With settlement on October 8,  2003 adidas-Salomon issued a € 400 million convertible bond
through its wholly owned Dutch subsidiary,  adidas-Salomon International Finance B. V.,  guaranteed
by adidas-Salomon AG.  The bond was issued in tranches of € 50000 each with a maturity up to
15 years.  The bond is,  at the option of the respective holder,  subject to certain conditions,  convertible from and including November 18,  2003 up to and including September 20,  2018 into ordinary
no-par-value bearer shares of adidas-Salomon AG at the conversion price of € 10200 which was
fixed upon issue.  The coupon of the bond is 25% and is payable annually in arrears on October 8
of each year,  commencing on October 8,  2004.  The bond is convertible into approximately four
million no-par-value shares. 

135

The convertible bond is not callable by the issuer until October 2009 and callable thereaftersubject to a 130% trigger between October 2009 and October 2012 and subject to a 115% trigger
between October 2012 and 2015,  unconditionally thereafter.  Investors have the right to put the bond
in October 2009,  October 2012 and October 2015. 
The fair values of the liability component and the equity conversion component were determined on the issuance of the bond.  The fair value of the liability component,  included in long-term
borrowings,  was calculated using a market interest rate of approximately 53% for an equivalent
straight bond.  The residual amount of € 1166 million (less transaction costs of € 23 million related
thereto),  representing the value of the equity conversion component,  is included in shareholders'
equity in capital reserve. 
In subsequent periods,  the liability component continues to be presented on the amortized cost
basis,  until conversion or maturity of the bond.  The equity conversion component is determined on
the issuance of the bond and will not change in subsequent periods. 
As a result of the temporary suspension of the € 750 million German multi-currency commercial paper program and the € 300 million Belgian treasury notes program,  the Group had a decline
in the total nominal amount of outstanding commercial paper to € 29 million at December 31,  2003
from € 234 million at December 31,  2002. 
Borrowings are denominated in a variety of currencies in which the Group conducts its business.  The largest portions of effective net borrowings (before liquidity swaps for cash management
purposes) as at December 31,  2003 are denominated in euro (566%; 2002: 542%) and US dollars
(392%; 2002: 297%). 
Month-end weighted average interest rates on borrowings in all currencies ranged from 25%
to 32% and from 30% to 34% for the years ending December 31,  2003 and 2002 respectively. 
As at December 31,  2003 the Group had cash credit lines and other longer-term financing
arrangements totaling € 34 billion (2002: € 35 billion); thereof unused credit lines accounting
for € 24 billion (2002: € 19 billion).  In addition,  the Group had separate lines for the issuance of
letters of credit in an amount of approximately € 04 billion (2002: € 06 billion).  The decline reflects
 shift in payment practices with product suppliers in the Far East,  from letters of credit to settlements in open account. 
The Group's outstanding financings are unsecured.  The outstanding € 109 million under the
multi-country on-balance-sheet ABS program are included with the same amount in the reported
accounts receivable as well as long-term borrowings as at December 31,  2003. 
The committed medium-term credit lines as well as the private placement and convertible
bond documentations contain a negative-pledge clause and a minimum equity covenant.  As at
December 31,  2003,  actual shareholders' equity was well above the amount of the minimum equity
covenant.

stock option plan in January and June 2003,  the nominal amount of Contingent Capital I at the
balance sheet date amounted to € 3232352,  divided into 1262637 no-par-value shares.  The
corresponding changes to the Articles of Association were filed for entry into the Commercial
Register in January 2004. 
As a result of the exercise of 83300 stock options and the issuance of 83300 no-par-value
bearer shares associated with the fifth exercise period of Tranche II (2000) and the second exercise
period of Tranche III (2001) of the stock option plan in January 2004,  the nominal amount of Contingent Capital I was reduced to € 3019104,  divided into 1179337 no-par-value shares. 
Pursuant to § 4 section 6 of the Articles of Association the nominal capital has been further
increased conditionally by up to € 23040000,  divided into not more than 9000000 no-par-value
bearer shares (Contingent Capital II).  The contingent capital increase shall be effected only to the
extent that the bearers of warrants or conversion rights resulting from bonds with warrants or
convertible bonds which are issued or guaranteed based on the authorization resolved upon by the
Annual General Meeting of May 10,  2001 by adidas-Salomon AG or by a wholly owned,  directly or
indirectly held subsidiary exercise their warrants or conversion rights. 

139

By resolution of the Annual General Meeting held on May 8,  2003,  shareholders approved
the creation of further contingent capital (Contingent Capital III) and the issuance of bonds with
warrants and convertible bonds,  with the authorization to exclude shareholders' subscription rights. 
Pursuant to this new § 4 section 7 of the Articles of Association,  which was entered into the Commercial Register on June 26,  2003,  the nominal capital has been further increased conditionally by
up to € 23040000,  divided into not more than 9000000 no-par-value bearer shares (Contingent
Capital III).  The contingent capital increase will be implemented only to the extent that the holders
of the subscription or conversion rights or the persons obligated to exercise the subscription or
conversion duties based on the bonds with warrants or convertible bonds,  which are issued or
guaranteed by the Company or a wholly owned direct or indirect subsidiary of the Company pursuant to the authorization of the Executive Board by the shareholder resolution dated May 8,  2003make use of their subscription or conversion rights or,  if they are obligated to exercise the subscription or conversion rights,  they discharge their obligations to exercise the warrant or convert
the bond.  The Executive Board is authorized,  subject to Supervisory Board approval,  to fully suspend the shareholders' rights to subscribe the bonds with warrants and / or convertible bonds,  if
the Executive Board concludes following an examination in accordance with its legal duties that
the issue price of the bonds with warrants and / or convertible bonds is not significantly below the
hypothetical market value computed using recognized financial calculation methods.  This authorization to suspend the subscription rights applies,  however,  only with respect to the bonds with
warrants and / or convertible bonds with subscription or conversion rights to the shares having pro
rata amount of the registered share capital totaling a maximum of € 11600000. 
With the entry of § 4 section 7 of the Company's Articles of Association into the Commercial
Register,  the authorization of the Annual General Meeting held on May 10,  2001 to issue bonds with
warrants and convertible bonds expired.  Accordingly,  it will be proposed to the Annual General
Meeting on May 13,  2004 that the corresponding Contingent Capital II be cancelled. 

Distributable Profits and Dividends
Distributable profits to shareholders are determined by reference to the retained earnings of
adidas-Salomon AG and calculated under German Commercial Law. 
The Executive Board of adidas-Salomon AG recommends a dividend of € 100 for 2003,  subject
to approval of shareholders.  The dividend for 2002 was also € 100 per share.

Service Arrangements
The Group has outsourced certain logistics and information technology functions,  for which it has
entered into long-term contracts.  Financial commitments under these contracts mature as follows:

23 /// FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Management of Foreign Exchange Risk
The Group is subject to currency exposure,  primarily due to an imbalance of its global cash flows
caused by the high share of product sourcing invoiced in US dollars,  while sales other than in
US dollars are invoiced mainly in European currencies,  but also in Japanese yen,  Canadian dollars
and other currencies.  It is the Group's policy to hedge identified currency risks arising from forecasted transactions when it becomes exposed.  In addition,  the Group hedges balance sheet risks
selectively. 
Risk management is conducted by using natural hedges and arranging forward contractscurrency options and currency swaps.  It is Group policy to concentrate on hedging instrumentssuch as currency options or option combinations,  which provide protection and,  at the same timeretain the potential to benefit from future favorable exchange rate developments in the financial
markets.  In 2003,  the share of options increased slightly compared to 2002. 
In 2003,  the Group contracted currency options with premiums paid in a total amount of
€ 166 million (2002: € 122 million).  Since currency options serve as cash flow hedges for future
product transactions,  the related premiums are recorded in income at the same time as the underlying transaction is recorded.  The total amount of option premiums,  which was charged to income
in 2003,  is € 108 million (2002: € 40 million).  Paid option premiums (as part of the total capitalized
fair value) in an amount of € 176 million and € 114 million were deferred as at December 31,  2003
and 2002 respectively. 
The total net amount of US dollar purchases against other currencies was $ 16 billion and
$ 12 billion in the years ending December 31,  2003 and 2002 respectively. 
The notional amounts of all outstanding currency hedging instruments,  which are mainly
related to cash flow hedges,  are summarized in the following table:

Management of Interest Rate Risk
It has been the policy of the Group to concentrate its financing on short-term borrowings,  but to
protect against liquidity risks with longer-term financing agreements,  and to protect against the
risk of rising interest rates with interest rate caps.  In view of the continuing decline of the borrowings,  no additional caps were arranged in 2003.  Further,  during 2003 adidas-Salomon made use of
the historically low long-term interest rates to shift parts of its borrowings from floating to fixedrate financing arrangements.  The share of fixed-rate financing rose sharply as a result of the
issuance of the convertible bond and the long-term private placements with investors in the USA
and the Far East. 
The interest rate hedges which were outstanding as at December 31,  2003 and 2002 respectively expire as detailed below:

Out of the positive fair value of € 6 million of forward contracts,  negative € 42 million relate to
hedging instruments falling under hedge accounting as per definition of IAS 39,  split into a negative
fair value of € 53 million from cash flow hedges and a positive fair value of € 11 million from net
investment hedges (see further details below).  The total fair value of outstanding currency options
relates to cash flow hedges. 
The fair value adjustments of outstanding cash flow hedges for forecasted sales will be
reported in the income statement when the forecasted sales transaction is recorded,  the wide
majority being forecasted for 2004.  A minority of cash flow hedges relate to an embedded derivative
within a specific contract and will be transferred from equity to the income statement at specified
payment dates up to 2008 as per the contract.  The embedded derivative is not separated from the
host contract,  as the economic characteristics and risk of the embedded derivative are closely
related to the host contract.  Other significant embedded derivatives did not exist at the balance
sheet date. 
In addition,  adidas-Salomon hedges part of its net investment in Salomon & Taylor Made Co. Ltd.,  Tokyo (Japan) with forward contracts.  A related gain of € 15 million in 2003 is recognized in
equity. 

142 FINANCIAL ANALYSIS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (IFRS) /// NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET

Total 
The above instruments had a negative fair value of € 3 million as at December 31,  2003 and
2002. 
Some of the instruments qualify as cash flow hedges pursuant to IAS 39.  The related positive
change in fair value of € 02 million was credited in equity and will be expensed according to interest rate developments in parallel to the underlying hedged item.  The negative change in the fair
value of the remaining instruments of € 02 million was recorded directly in the income statementas incurred. 
Credit Risk
The Group's treasury arranges currency and interest rate hedges,  and invests cash,  with major
banks of a high credit standing throughout the world,  all being rated 'A-" or higher in terms of
Standard & Poor's long-term ratings (or a comparable rating from other rating agencies). 

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT
24 /// OPERATING EXPENSES (SELLING,  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS WELL
AS DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION (EXCL.  GOODWILL) )
Operating expenses include expenses for sales,  marketing and research and development,  as well
as for logistics and central finance and administration.  In addition,  they include depreciation on
tangible and amortization on intangible assets,  with the exception of goodwill amortization and
other depreciation and amortization which is included in the cost of sales. 
 significant portion of the operating expenses comprises the marketing working budget.  The
marketing working budget consists of promotion and communication spending such as promotion
contracts,  advertising,  retail support,  events and other communication activities,  however it does
not include marketing overhead expenses.  For the year 2003,  marketing working budget accounted
for approximately 35% (2002: 35%) of the total operating expenses. 
Total depreciation and amortization expense for tangible and intangible assets (excluding
goodwill) was € 110 million and € 114 million for the years ending December 31,  2003 and 2002
respectively.  Thereof € 15 million and € 17 million were recorded within the cost of sales as they
are directly attributable to the production costs of goods sold.

Deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that the realization of the related benefit
is probable.  Based on the past performance and the prospects of the respective business for the
foreseeable future,  valuation allowances are established where this criterion is not met. 
Valuation allowances refer to deferred tax assets of companies which are operating in the
start-up phase or in certain emerging markets,  since the realization of the related tax benefits is
not probable.  Further,  adidas Salomon North America Inc.  has tax loss carryforwards,  which can in
part only be utilized in limited annual amounts through to 2007,  for which a valuation allowance is
established for amounts in excess of income projections. 
The Group does not recognize deferred tax liabilities for unremitted earnings of non-German
subsidiaries to the extent that they are expected to be permanently invested in international operations.  The earnings could become subject to additional tax if they were remitted as dividends,  or if
foreign earnings were loaned to the subsidiary,  or if the Group were to sell its shareholdings in the
subsidiaries.

28 /// EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net income attributable to shareholders
by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. 
Dilutive potential shares have arisen under the management stock option plan of
adidas-Salomon AG,  which was implemented in 1999.  As none of the required performance
criteria for the exercise of the stock options of Tranche I (1999) and III (2001) of the stock option
plan have been fulfilled to date,  these Tranches did not affect the calculation of dilutive earnings
per share.  However under Tranche II of the stock option plan,  dilutive potential shares impact the diluted earnings per share calculation. 
It is not necessary to include dilutive potential shares arising from the convertible bond
issuance in October 2003 in the calculation of diluted earnings per share as at December 31,  2003
as none of the required conversion criteria were fulfilled at the balance sheet date (see note 15). 

Current taxes in the amount of € 1 million which relate to net investment hedges have been
credited directly to shareholders' equity for the years' ending December 31,  2003 and 2002 (see
also note 23).

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
29 /// SEGMENTAL INFORMATION
The Group operates predominately in one industry segment,  the design,  wholesale and marketing
of athletic and sports lifestyle products.  The Group is currently managed by brands and on the basis
of a regional structure. 
Certain functions of the Group are centralized and an allocation of these functions to specific
segments is not considered to be meaningful.  This includes mainly central treasury,  worldwide
sourcing and global marketing as well as other headquarter departments.  Assets,  liabilitiesincome and expenses relating to these corporate functions are presented in the Headquarter /
Consolidation column together with non-allocable items and the intersegment elimination. 
Compared to the 2002 annual financial statements,  the TaylorMade-adidas Golf segment does
not include Slazenger Golf.  At the beginning of January 2002,  the Group took over distribution and
licensing rights for the Maxfli and Slazenger Golf brands from the Dunlop Slazenger group. 
Whereas adidas-Salomon purchased the Maxfli brand in late 2002,  the distribution and licensing
rights for Slazenger Golf were terminated.  Net sales for the Slazenger Golf brand were approximately € 25 million in 2002.

Net sales to third parties are shown in the geographic market in which the revenues are
realized.  Intersegment sales represent sales to operational units not belonging to the same region. 
The global sourcing function is included in the Headquarter / Consolidation column.  There are no
sales between the brands. 
Transactions between the segments are based on the dealing-at-arm's-length principle. 
Segment assets include all operating assets and comprise mainly accounts receivable,  inventory as well as property,  plant and equipment and intangible assets.  Segment liabilities comprise
operating liabilities and consist principally of trade and other payables and accrued liabilities and
provisions.  Non-allocable items include goodwill,  financial assets,  assets and liabilities relating to
income taxes and borrowings,  which are included in the Headquarter / Consolidation column. 
Capital expenditure,  amortization and depreciation relate to segment assets; the acquisition of
goodwill do not affect capital expenditure.

Compared to the 2002 presentation,  the consolidated statement of cash flows has been adjusted to
reflect the amended balance sheet structure.  Cash and cash equivalents have been adjusted by
approximately € 9 million to reflect this year's balance sheet presentation.  This position is now
reported as a decrease in short-term financial assets under investing activities.  Accordingly,  the
effect of exchange rates on cash has also been adjusted. 
The Group acquired all outstanding shares of Arc'Teryx Equipment Inc.  and Salomon Danmark
ApS in 2002 (see also note 4). 
The fair value of the net assets approximated the book value of the net assets acquired.

such claims will not materially affect the consolidated financial position of the Group.

Management Stock Option Plan (MSOP) adidas-Salomon AG
On May 20,  1999 the Annual General Meeting resolved to increase the nominal capital of
adidas-Salomon AG conditionally by up to € 3500000 through the issuance of not more than
1367187 no-par-value shares (Contingent Capital I) for the granting of stock options to members
of the Executive Board of adidas-Salomon AG and to Managing Directors / Senior Vice Presidents of
its affiliated companies as well as to further senior executives and executives of adidas-Salomon
AG and of its affiliated companies.  On May 8,  2002 the shareholders resolved to extend the term of
the subscription rights granted under the stock option plan to up to five years. 
Under the stock option plan adopted by the shareholders of adidas-Salomon AG on May 201999 and amended by resolution of the Annual General Meeting on May 8,  2002,  the Executive
Board was authorized to issue non-transferable stock options for up to 1367187 no-par-value
bearer shares to the above-mentioned persons including the Executive Board until August 27,  2004. 
The granting of stock options may take place in tranches that shall not exceed 25% of the total
volume for each fiscal year. 
There is a two-year vesting period for the stock options and a term of approximately five years
upon their respective issue. 
The following stock options have been issued so far:
NUMBER OF STOCK OPTIONS
Originally issued 
The stock options may only be exercised subject to the attainment of at least one of the following performance objectives:
(1) Absolute Performance:
During the period between the issuance and exercise of the stock options,  the stock market price
for the adidas-Salomon share calculated upon the basis of the total shareholder return approach
– has increased by an annual average of at least 8%. 
(2) Relative Performance:
During the same period,  the stock market price for the adidas-Salomon share must have developed
by an annual average of 1% more favorably than the stock market prices of a basket of competitors
of adidas-Salomon globally and in absolute terms may not have fallen. 
The stock options may only be exercised against payment of the exercise price.  The exercise
price corresponds to the arithmetical mean of the closing prices of the adidas-Salomon share
over the last 20 trading days of the respective exercise period,  less a discount,  which is composed
of the absolute and relative performance components.  In any case,  the exercise price shall be at
least the lowest issue price as stated in § 9 section 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG)currently € 256. 
The option terms and conditions stipulate that the stock options may be used for existing
common shares in lieu of new shares from the contingent capital,  or in the place of common shares
the discount is paid in cash.
