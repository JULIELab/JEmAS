Corporate Mission Statement
adidas-Salomon strives to be the global leader in the sporting goods
industry with sports brands built on a passion for competition and a
sporting lifestyle. 
We are consumer focused.  That means we are continuously
improving the quality,  look,  feel and image of our products to match
and exceed consumer expectations and to provide them with the
highest value. 
We strive to bring innovation in technology and design to our foot
wear,  apparel and hardware products in order to help athletes of
all skill levels achieve peak performance. 
We are a global organization that is socially and environmentally
responsible,  creative and financially rewarding for our employees
and shareholders. 
Our strategy is simple: continuously strengthen our brands and products
to improve our competitive position and financial performance. 
In the medium term,  we will extend our leading market position
in Europe,  expand our share of the US footwear market to 20% and
continue to deliver significant sales increases in Asia.  The resulting
top-line growth,  together with strict cost control and working capital
improvements,  will drive continued earnings growth. 

CROSSING THE LINE
STRATEGY Crossing the finish line first is the unique privilege of the winner.  It is the
culmination of years of planning and preparation.  Crossing the line signifies that a particular
goal or a target has been achieved.  In 2001,  adidas-Salomon reached its targets,  thanks
to the implementation of ideas,  the effective performance of teams and focused strategy. 
In this section,  Management provides an overview of the Group's brand strategies,  share
development,  employees,  global operations,  as well as social and environmental affairs.

DAX-30 Index

Shareholder Structure*

In 2001,  the adidas-Salomon share price
improved significantly.  It outperformed the
DAX-30,  Germany's premiere stock index,  by
48%.  While the index itself ended the year down
20%,  adidas-Salomon was the top performer
with a gain of 28% and a year-end price of
€ 8430.  The adidas-Salomon share was also
32% ahead of the Standard & Poor's SuperCap
Footwear Index,  which comprises all major
footwear competitors in America.  This index
lost 4% in the course of 2001 as a result of
the ongoing competitive environment for
sporting goods in the US.

of the year but the trend was generally positive.  The

in deteriorating financial results and profit warnings

sectors.  This led to investor skepticism towards the

markets overall and towards the sporting goods
market in particular.  However,  Management held fast
to its objectives and early signs that the Group was
on track to meet its financial targets became visible. 

* As of June 2001

This,  together with strong brand concepts and positive
response from retailers to new product collections
ensured that the generally negative climate had only
 minor impact on the adidas-Salomon share price. 

Management's Credibility Creates Momentum
The tragic events of September 11 caused all major
markets and most stocks to fall significantly in value. 
That catastrophe,  in combination with the initial
negative reaction to the Group's announcement that
it will acquire a 10% stake in the Bayern Munich
Football Club,  pushed the share price down to
its year-low of € 4770 in September.  Proactive
communication from Management and earlier than
expected positive footwear backlogs in the US helped
enhance adidas-Salomon's credibility in the financial
markets.  As a result,  investor confidence grew and
the upward trend for the adidas-Salomon share continued.  Momentum increased in the fourth quarterwith the year-high share price of € 8430 being
reached on December 28. 
International Shareholder Structure
The trend towards a more institutional and international shareholder structure continued in 2001. 
The majority of adidas-Salomon shares are held by
institutional investors.  Share ownership trends show
 clear shift away from a large number of smaller
investors towards a more concentrated group of
dedicated investors.  Of the known institutional
investors,  the largest group,  on a regional level,  are
North Americans,  who hold 27% of adidas Salomon's
453 million outstanding shares.  This compares to
28% in 2000.  Europeans now hold 24% of the Company's shares against 21% last year.  German shareholders currently hold 16% versus 17% in the prior
year and other international institutional investors 


The Share 
hold 2%,  up from 1% in 2000.  The remaining 31%
is held in smaller,  undisclosed holdings including
retail investors and former management.  In the prior
year,  this group accounted for 33% of all shares. 
These figures are estimates,  based on annual ownership analysis of the Company's shares,  last conducted
in June 2001.  With no investor holding 5% or more
of outstanding shares,  the free float of adidasSalomon shares is 100%.

This is at the top end of the Company's dividend
policy,  which recommends a payout ratio of between
15 and 20% of consolidated net income.  This year's
return to the established dividend policy was

Global Operations
The Global Operations mission is to advance
adidas-Salomon's brand strategy by creatingmanufacturing and delivering products which
meet and exceed customer and consumer
expectations.  In 2001,  there is extensive evidence
that adidas-Salomon improved its 'end to end"
supply chain solutions,  optimizing partnerships
with raw material suppliers,  manufacturersfreight consolidators,  ocean/air transporters and
retailers.  Global Operations made significant
progress in its contribution to the Group's overall
brand strategy.  Continuous improvements were
made to the entire supply chain,  making it
faster,  more efficient and less cost-intensive. 
These steps were accomplished within the
context of the Group's commitment to further
improving its social and environmental
performance.

2001,  the Group reduced four weeks from its procurement cycle and exceeded its 10-week reduction
goals in certain product development areas.  In 2002a primary focus will be on better aligning footwear
and apparel lead times with each other. 

Optimizing the Production Process
adidas-Salomon is also committed to improving the
efficiency and service of the Group's production process.  Lean manufacturing processes have been introduced by the Global Operations team,  which have
eliminated waste throughout the supply chain,  and
are rapidly setting the standard for the industry.  To
share these measures with manufacturing partnersGlobal Operations have organized extensive training
sessions.  The results have been so positive that by

efforts are critical to maximizing Group sales potentialcustomer service and consumer demand needs.  As a
result of the success and visibility of these improvements,  adidas-Salomon will be putting resources into
building this program even further in the future. 

Focusing Supplier Relationships
The Group continues to consolidate its supplier
base so as to increase its influence and power with
suppliers.  This focus will in turn allow adidasSalomon to create customized solutions,  further
improve social and environmental performance and
lower purchasing costs.  adidas-Salomon has already
reduced the number of its footwear suppliers of both
raw materials and finished goods by 20%.  And using
the lean manufacturing concepts mentioned aboveGlobal Operations is now focused on increasing the
efficiency and flexibility of apparel suppliers to help
further streamline those relationships.

Social and Environmental Affairs
In 2001,  adidas-Salomon took the important
step of publishing a comprehensive statement
about its social and environmental programs
for the year 2000 'Our World".  With this first
social and environmental report externally

area clear by further promoting its 'Standards

the Group's requirements for labor,  healthsafety and environmental issues in its suppliers'
factories and build the basis for the adidasSalomon international factory monitoring
program. 

 Diverse Team
The task of the adidas-Salomon SOE team is to secure

ON THE LINE
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS Sport requires boundaries.  The lanes in a swimming
pool,  the chalk lines on a tennis court,  the goals on a football field define where and how great
sporting performances can be achieved.  In much the same way,  adidas-Salomon works within
 framework.  And in each region and with each brand,  the Group made great steps forward in
2001.  The following pages outline how these targets were achieved.  The Risk Report addresses
how adidas-Salomon proactively manages risk to capitalize on relevant business opportunities. 
The business outlook for 2002 is outlined both qualitatively and quantitatively.  And to be consistent
with the Group's commitment towards making corporate governance structures more transparent,  information regarding the Supervisory and Executive Boards is also included.

adidas-Salomon consolidated net sales increased
by 5% in 2001 to € 61 billion.  The gross margin
was maintained at an industry-leading 426%
despite currency pressure in Europe and an
extremely promotional retail sales environment
in the United States.  Through strict cost control
and savings in the Group's marketing working
budget,  operating expenses as a percent of net
sales declined 105 basis points versus the prior
year to 348%.  adidas-Salomon's income before
taxes was € 376 million,  up 9% versus 2000. 
The lower tax rate and minorities helped drive
the 15% growth in net income to € 208 million
or € 460 per share.  This result is in line with the
expectations communicated by the Group since
the beginning of 2001. 

Global Economic Climate Develops Adversely
adidas-Salomon's strong performance improvements
in 2001 were particularly notable in light of the adverse
economic climate in all major international markets. 
International stock exchanges suffered their worst
development in a decade.  National economies in all
global markets were under pressure.  Momentum of
the US economy slowed substantially with negative
GDP growth in the second half of the year and an
already weak retail performance declining significantly
following the tragic events of September 11.  Germany
experienced its lowest GDP growth since the 1993
recession with retail remaining weak throughout the
year.  Japan's economy suffered its fourth recession
in 10 years with strong consumer spending declines. 
Unemployment rates rose in all major markets. 
Emerging markets also continued to suffer,  with major
economic crises occurring in Turkey and Argentina.

continued to increase sourcing costs in Europe
and the heavily promotional retail sales environment in the US persisted.  This drove operating
profit for the brand down 10% versus 2000despite strict cost control,  which led to a 2%

adidas Sales Top € 48 Billion
In 2001,  adidas net sales increased 3% to € 48 billion. 
Growth came from all regions except North America. 
On a currency-neutral basis this increase was 4%. 
Retail sales increased 37% to € 354 million in 2001with new adidas concept and Originals stores as well
as factory outlets being a major contributor.  Sales from
the Original division were the largest component of
brand adidas growth,  up more than 50% versus the
prior year.  These products,  which officially became a
separate product division in 2001,  grew at double-digit
rates in all regions.  Basketball was the strongest growing
sports category in the Forever Sport division,  with
sales up 37% as a result of strong performance by The
KOBE and KOBETWO as well as other innovative
products including All Day All Night,  Mad Handle and

Net sales at TaylorMade-adidas Golf grew 24% to

In particular,  TaylorMade metalwoods sales were up
50% versus the prior year.  This is the industry's largest
and most important category.  The 300 Series,  a new
line of metalwoods and irons targeted at optimizing
the strengths of individual golfers,  was the primary
contributor of growth in the category.  In 2001,  the
TaylorMade driver from this collection was the
leading driver on the US,  European and Japanese

Supervisory Board Report
Dear ShareholdersIn the year under review,  the Supervisory Board
oversaw the management activities of the Executive
Board on a regular basis and acted in an advisory
capacity.  The Supervisory Board was kept informed
about the financial position of the Company,  corporate
policy and matters relating to major business transactions through verbal and written reports from the
Executive Board.  In five joint meetings with the
Executive Board and in one meeting of the General 
Topics covered by the Supervisory Board in 2001

included:

Financial Statements 
 The development of business and future business
strategies in the United States.

 The planned acquisition of a 10% participation
in FC Bayern München AG. 
 The acquisition of Arc'Teryx Equipment Inc. 
 The conclusion of a license and distribution

adidas-Salomon AG from drawing up consolidated
financial statements in accordance with German
Commercial Law. 

Committee of the Supervisory Board,  business development of the adidas-Salomon Group as well as the
individual operational units and the major Group
companies was reviewed in detail.  In addition to
the responsibilities laid down by law and the Articles
of Association,  the Supervisory Board acted in an
advisory capacity in important individual matters. 

Additional topics dealt with by the Supervisory
Board were:
 The distribution of the third tranche of the adidasSalomon AG management stock option plan. 
 The technical innovations of the Spring/Summer
2002 range. 
 The European logistics concept. 

The external auditors,  KPMG Deutsche TreuhandGesellschaft Aktiengesellschaft Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft,  Frankfurt am Main,  have audited the
consolidated financial statements and the Group
management report.  Additionally,  they have audited
the financial statements and the management report
of adidas-Salomon AG and issued unqualified opinions thereon.  In the context of their auditing duties 
The external auditors attended the annual financial
statements meeting of the Supervisory Board on
March 8,  2001 and subsequent meetings on May 9August 6 and November 5,  2001.  During these meetings,  the quarterly financial statements for 2001
were presented. 

in line with § 317 section 4 HGB,  the auditors have
looked at the existing adidas-Salomon AG monitoring system for early identification of risk.  They concluded that the existing system was appropriate and
that the management reports for adidas-Salomon AG
and the Group accurately reflected future risk.  The
financial statements,  the management reports and
the auditors' reports have been presented to all the

BETWEEN THE LINES
FINANCIAL ANALYSIS In sport as in business,  headlines often get the most attention,  but the proof
is in the details.  There is more to winning a match than what you see on the field,  and what goes on
behind the scenes is vital.  In this section,  adidas-Salomon presents the information necessary for
 deeper understanding of the Group's 2001 results.  The financial tables as well as an explanation
of adidas-Salomon's accounting policies and extensive details regarding the 2001 financials are the
focus of this section.  Segmental reporting,  a listing of adidas-Salomon's full shareholdings,  a glossary
of relevant terms and a financial overview of the most important figures are also included.

section 2 No.  4b of the German Commercial Code (HGB). 

a) Framework for Accounting Policies in Accordance with IAS
The accounting policies of entities in accordance with International
Accounting Standards (IAS) are based on the objective of providing investors with decision-relevant information.  It is thus not possible to show
lower profits for the protection of creditors or influence results by using
tax-based values (requirement for income and expenses to be recorded

purposes). 
There are no specific rules setting out the way in which individual items
Based on the assumption that decision-relevant information should be
provided to investors,  it follows that accounting policies should be aimed
at showing an entity's operating results,  rather than determining the
amount of distributable profits whilst bearing in mind the need for protection of creditors. 
As a rule,  accounting policies in accordance with IAS have a lower level
of prudence than German accounting policies,  which leads to the follow

of the consolidated income statement is also broadly similar to the AngloSaxon classification,  using the cost of sales classification method.

trading purposes. 
Hedges of net investments in foreign entities are accounted for similarly
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognized in the balance
sheet at cost and subsequently measured at their fair value.  The method
of recognizing the resulting gain or loss is dependent on the nature of
the item being hedged.  On the date a derivative contract is entered into
to cash flow hedges.  If the hedging instrument is a derivative (e.g.  a
forward contract) or for example a foreign currency borrowing,  any gains
and losses in the derivative and all gains and losses arising on the translation of the borrowing are recognized in equity. 

the Company designates certain derivatives as either a hedge of the fair
value of a recognized asset or liability (fair value hedge) or a hedge of a
forecasted transaction (cash flow hedge),  or a hedge of a net investment
in a foreign entity. 

The Company documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items,  as well as the risk
management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.  This process includes linking all derivatives designated as hedges
to specific forecasted transactions.  The Company also documents its assessment,  both at the hedge inception and on an ongoing basis,  whether the
derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in
offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items.

to corporate and trade taxes.  In 2000 a new corporate tax legislation was
enacted in Germany,  which,  among other changes,  abolished the split
rate imputation credit system. 
Under the old corporate tax system a tax rate of 40% plus a surcharge
of 55% thereon has been applied for undistributed earnings on the level
of the Company.  Upon distribution of domestic earnings,  which had been
subject to corporate tax at 40%,  10 percentage points of corporate tax
and the attributable surcharge thereon were refunded to the Company. 
Effective January 1,  2001 a uniform corporate tax rate of 25% plus a
surcharge of 55% thereon is applied to earnings.

30.  Equity Compensation Benefits
Special Reward and Incentive Plan (SRIP)
adidas-Salomon AG implemented a one-time offer share option plan
during the second quarter of 1997 for certain key employees and
Executive Board members.  The options can be exercised at a fixed
pre-determined price.  The rights and terms governing the exercise are
fixed in the option agreement.  One half of the options were exercisable
immediately after the implementation of the plan.  The other options
were exercisable in tranches through December 31,  2001.  A total of
440000 options were granted to exercise the equal number of shares. 
The option plan is sponsored by two shareholders (Robert Louis-Dreyfus
and Christian Tourres) who supply the shares which are required to fulfill
the Company's obligation under the plan.  The shares are made available
at a value equal to the exercise price of the options.  The contribution
(being the difference between realized share price and exercise price
for options exercised) from the two shareholders for the years ended
December 31,  2001 and 2000 of € 1775828 and € 259874 respectively
is shown as extraordinary income; the respective expenses of the same
amounts are included in the selling,  general and administrative expenses. 

Stock Option Plans
On May 20,  1999,  the Ordinary Shareholders' Meeting resolved contingent capital in the amount of € 3500000 to grant stock options for
no-par-value bearer shares.  These stock options were to be granted to the
members of the Executive Board of adidas-Salomon AG,  to the Managing
Directors/Senior Vice Presidents of its affiliated companies as well as to
further senior executives and executives of adidas-Salomon AG and its
affiliated companies. 
Under the adopted stock option plan,  the Executive Board has been
authorized to issue non-transferable stock options for up to 1367187
no-par-value bearer shares to the above mentioned persons until August
27,  2004.  The granting of stock options can take place in tranches that
shall not exceed 25% of the total volume for each fiscal year. 
There is a two-year vesting period for the stock options and a term of
approximately three years upon their respective issue.  In the reporting
year,  341100 stock options were issued in Tranche III of the program. 
Of these issued options,  339950 still exist on the balance sheet date.  Of
the 329700 stock options from Tranche II,  issued in the previous reporting year,  294800 exist at year-end 2001.  Of the 263000 stock options
issued in Tranche I in 1999,  190050 still exist at year-end 2001. 
The stock options can only be exercised subject to the attainment of at
least one of the following performance objectives:
